21,k4g1s6,dating_advice,Tue Dec  1 09:13:43 2020,"Help me understand this, before i drive myself crazy","I am 33 (F), I met this guy on Tinder (28). The first date was great, went for a walk. He had been texting quite a lot after that, met on a second date, which was great as well, ended up having sex. I am not a great texter, at least not sure how to hold up an interesting conversation with a stranger. However, I genuinely like this guy a lot, and sex was making everything a bit intense, I believe I was texting him more after the second date, but on the third date, he was a bit distant. I was on my periods, we did not have sex and he left. Anyways he was acting extremely distant over text after that, replying in one line or so and I was sending him texts at a frequency that I was getting from him after the first two dates. Anyway, he realized I was feeling a bit anxious, vulnerable, so he called me to say that he doesn't see us getting along in long term, and he doesn't see him getting serious for me. I liked this guy a lot, I asked him he wanted something casual, he agreed. On the fourth date, he apologized and said he saw me being vulnerable, and he is commitment-phobic. I did not want to go into details as he is not into me as much I am into him, so I said no worries. I am glad we are on the same page. Now, on that date we had sex, he stayed over (the first time), he was about to leave and changed his mind. Always on the fifth date, we talked about our fantasies. I am kinky in bed, and I had told him on the second date that I am not to be handled gently. He had mentioned that he likes to be dominant in bed. I told him I like slapping, hair pulling, typical d/s relationship. He said all his relationships has been vanilla, and he is into being dominant in bed, so he likes that I am kinky and sub. Now few things: 1) We are talking about sexual fantasies (role play), and I said something about a American (and he is like you wont't have an issue with that, as there are so many Americans out there). I got frozen a bit, as I was not expecting that answer, rather more like we can try out or we can't. After that, i said yeah you are right i should find an American for that fantasy, and he holded my hand tight, saying americans are fucking everyone 2) I said i am so sick of covid, i want to move to ny so I can see people, he is like ""don't leave me"". I am like you can come with me, you like people 3) He says: You will meet my roommate one day (all our sexual encounters have been at my place) if we continue seeing each other. I did not reply, and he himself said we will continue seeing each other. I said yes. 4) He aksed me if i will go on a bike ride with him when he gets a second helmet. He showed me what helmet he will get for me, I kept quiet. 5) He never use condoms. I have to ask everytime if he wants it, as I do not want any STD if he is seeing anyone. He says he is not, and i told him condoms is in next drawer, and he should wear condom when he start seeing someone or if i should. I don't think he replied. 6) He asks me why a pretty girl like me is still single, I reply saying, you tell me. He said you are funny with my reply to his question. Now, people, I need help to understand this. I am good with causal, but i feel like i am getting mixed feelings from his end, though i may be reading a lot into it. Our all casual encounters happen in the apt. No dates outside e, as it is not dating. Should i ask him what are the boundaries so we don't catch feels or you think this kind of conversation is perfect for a casual relationship? I may be overthinking but I will appreciate some insight as this is my first time getting into casual.",/r/dating_advice/comments/k4g1s6/help_me_understand_this_before_i_drive_myself/,10
75,k5b7ay,dating_advice,Wed Dec  2 17:24:36 2020,Still in love with my old uni flatmate 4 years later - being able to romanticise a cheat thro pretending he isn’t one because it was a LDR he cheated on with me &amp; “we had something”,"Still in love with old uni flat mate 4 years later. Romanticising a ‘cheat’ - pretending he’s not one because it was a LDR that he cheated on with me and “we had something “

Being able to romanticise someone that cheated on their LDP with me because it was LD and “we had something”Still in love with my old uni flatmate 4 years later

This all probably sounds absolutely ridiculous.. i probably have rose tinted glasses on and fooling myself that he isn’t a shit person...  That I have enough standards and self love/ self respect to not possibly be able to romanticise a cheat. That he isn’t one - that we were more than that. We are more than that. Please read it all, I’m desperate - it’s been 3 years since we moved out, I’ve only seen him about four times since and I’m not over this, 4 years since I met him, I’d appreciate any help 

In my darkest of days, I haven’t hated myself enough to find cheats attractive. Even when my ex cheated on me, I immediately ended it. I have strong aversive feelings about cheats so much that i was instantly turned off and over my ex, I became indifferent to him, thought nothing of him when he revealed that he had cheated. Before this guy and with anyone else, no matter who - even we’ve had a history,  if they so much give a tint of flirting i go into grey rock mode, feel instantly grossed out etc. I couldn’t engage in any sort of “harmless tongue and cheek” wouldn’t entertain such. Unconsciously and automatically, I don’t have to think about it - the wrongness, it was just an automatic reflex to me.. well, was... 


So this situation is just a mind fuck. 

Background: 

Before moving out of my family home to a house of strangers for uni, I searched my flat mates on Facebook. This guy in particular didn’t stand out. I didn’t have much of an opinion of him , I was just happy to move out and excited to make new friends. When I first got a glimpse of him from in my car, “ he didn’t blow my sock off “ so to speak , I didn’t think anything of him really, I was consumed by nerves at meeting everyone and starting a new chapter. He caught me off guard. I was not expecting or hoping for anything of the sort. I wanted friends but what this was, was not what I asked for to say the least... The very first utterance I was locked in. We bounced off each other , it was so electrical the chemistry. So much energy. At the same time, I felt myself, I was so comfortable, the most I had been in years around someone. This is at a time when I had anxiety that rids you of close friendships/ avoidant traits that makes those who you know you’d hit it off with, impossible to reach. To be present with. To be comfortable. He soothed the fear in me and ignited something too? 

After lectures, we’d spend almost every day together in either of our rooms, sometimes talking into the early hours of the morning sometimes. It wasn’t uncommon that we’d get lost in a conversation that was only suppose to be a quick catch up, 10 minutes would turn into hours. Very quickly into the year I started laying on his bed. Usually when he was on his pc. He began joining me in bed ( on top of duvet) , at first we were shoulder to shoulder on our backs squeezed in his single bed talking or watching a film. It felt innocent and friendly and natural too?  It’s weird I never saw it as anything at the time. He treated it like it was nothing too, it was a no brainer really, it just came natural and didn’t feel wrong? Like we didn’t think into it.. 

After a few months of this, of no touching except shoulder to shoulder, he put his arm around me awkwardly. It was honestly like we were teens but at same time it wasn’t a big deal, it didn’t feel relationshippy, it felt natural and certainly not wrong? So weird the fact he was in a relationship felt like it didn’t even enter our brains.

We never flirted intentionally , we tried to close off any feelings and kept it PG for a long time but being together felt soooo good, there wasn’t a way the attraction and chemistry couldn’t seep through

We’d want to hang out just to be in each other’s presence: we’d do our own thing but want to be in the same room? I definitely flocked to his room more than he did to mine but he’d rarely bat me away or end the conversation after an hour. 

I was emotionally vacant asf or emotionally astray as I was working through some trauma that came to the surface as a result of being away from my family for the first time. So I didn’t give off girlfriend vibes..  I was also reckless with what I’d tell him him, not to play games but to keep him at arms length because my love was too much for me to bare/ to manage/ to be in control of. I’d also bring back guys...  he’d hear of course. One time he told me he LIKED what he heard and that bloody hurt because If he liked me would he say that? I told myself in response to that, to mitigate that, that if he did like me, he would have been in so much cognitive dissonance and shame that he’d do anything to convince himself he didn’t like me.

One time he took a picture of us on my phone and put relationship goals in the caption ( no one saw it but me ofc). Sometimes he’d blurt a joke related to us being in a relationship and with a future , kids etc. He’d talk a lot about wanting to be a dad to me

One time he went down a rabbit hole reminiscing and he got talking about his ex and vaguely said something pertaining to how he wouldn’t be with someone like her because she hurt him and how I looked like her. He didn’t say it in a deep way. As I started to like him more and more &amp;amp; couldn’t ignore it, I started putting barriers in and would talk to myself through him almost -  like I resented loving him. I said once how I wouldn’t ever get with him because he knows too much about me in a sort of I’d never even consider it way because the stakes were too high. He replied back with a quick why? And spoke as though I wasnt talking about HIM - he spoke in general terms but in a perhaps hiding hurt way , pulling a confused face he then said “ it creates a foundation for a relationship or something like that, “with a surely?” on the end, wanting me to give more away it seemed 

A few times he’d compliment me , most of the time in a jokey back handed comments way(no negging, idk how to explain that). We’d banter a lot. One time I got real dressy for a formal and he couldn’t take his eyes off me, not in a creepy way but i noticed his eyes tracing back to me frequently as he threw himself into conversations and avoided me. I went straight up to him and he tried to seem like he wasn’t “taken back” by me but I could feel he had the feels that night. 
 
Now this will sound like a red flag , I’m totally aware of all sides of it but he would objectify me in a way to separate himself from me and keep the feelings at bay it felt. Like he’d play on the fact I was at the time exploiting my body - I was a cam girl. He wouldn’t shame me or make me feel bad he’d just joke about it a fair bit and make comments about how I always had a nipple out. And how I loved attention. He said it with the undertone of like a mix of concern for me and as a shield to keep him away from me in that way and also to try and dettach from me / internalise the unattraction he had about that 

To give background of what sort of person he is, every single time I was the slightest bit sad or homesick he’d do something goofy to make me laugh. Bring me cups of tea. Ask if I want anything down the shop. One time he met me at the uni because I didn’t want to walk back on my own in the dark. One time, I got home real late and had been spiked. He had a lecture in a few hours but he stayed up with me, albeit annoyed , he stroked my hair to calm me because I was bloody crazy from being spiked, in a fit of tears, I produced years worth of snot that he wiped up.  

It astounded me how pure of a person he was. I’d legit play up and try to make arguments because how I felt for him and how much I felt cared for and how stupidly genuine he was and he had a girlfriend. He never came down to a level of any sort of spite , he maintained the upmost respect for me while simultaneously respecting himself and being stern. He is emotionally intelligent. I on the other hand..... I’d literally pretend i was mad at him over stupid reasons, I myself thought I was mad at him for but on reflection, I was just mad and resentful because I wasn’t his. 

While I never played games and respected that he had a girlfriend for the large part, I was immature and I had lost my head. I know I should have probably moved house but I do not regret anything about that year because it was the best year of my life. I have extremely good fond innocent memories. 

As the months passed, our conversations became more intimate, not ever about *us* but bigger things: our dreams, passions, loves, families, we had spoke of those topics from the first few days of knowing each other, it was only natural to; we shared this deep sense of familiarity the second we clocked eyes (not to be a romanticist, that’s just how it was). We both installed so much confidence in each other about our dreams and would fuel excitement for the other, we were both amazed by each other. It was like being a kid under a duvet with another kid at a sleepover sharing secrets and big dreams and being silly about them &amp;amp; talking of what ifs about the world. I’ve never made someone light up like that. We were both deeply interested in what another had to say. We were just so vulnerable it blows my mind looking back. 

Leading up to the night we slept together, we started to get a little dirty with each other. Slight crude remarks here and there. We’d snap each other at night with something on show. I’d have my cleavage on screen and he’d show his chest..  

One night we went out and had a real whale of a time laughing till our bellies and bladders couldn’t take anymore. We got home in a drunk phase, we were totally aware of what we were doing yet had no control, we couldn’t help ourselves, we took off our clothes naturally and idk I’ve never been touched like it. we made love (makes me cringe to say but when I envision making love, i think of everything that happened that night; the epitome of making love). It wasn’t animally like sloppy, it was in full appreciation of each other? 


After that, we weren’t ever the same really. Though he didn’t really express it and closed off, I knew he felt deeeep shame. I felt guilt too with a concoction of extreme anger and sadness for why we weren’t together. The entire time we lived together, it was like his girlfriend didn’t exist. She lived in America and they FaceTimed every few days but she didn’t feel real until.. After that night, when i heard her voice on FaceTime... he distanced himself from me after that night. And I actually ended up meeting her as she visited for a few nights, I heard them
fuck . It fucked me up.

He never told me not to tell her or how I should be not explicitly or implicitly. He never mentioned anything about the incident. We pretended it didn’t happen. And I just didn’t tell his girlfriend.

That was three years ago. In our second year of uni we stayed in touch via social media and if I remember right , the snaps were less revealing and more restrained, they were still really flirty. 9/10 of our chats and him popping up would be just of a surface level convo , a quick flirt. We only had a couple Of long deep convos after we moved out, over message and they were spaced out over the years (our last one was last December before he broke up with his girlfriend about how he doesn’t love her anymore etc- even that convo, no hints about us were made - since moving out i sensed he didn’t have feelings for me anymore). A few times we’d drunk text each other about what we wanted to do to each other.. Contact started to fade out and then when I went to Australia for a semester, I confessed to him while I was out there that I had strong feelings for him. He gave vague responses. There was no way he didn’t feel what I did at the time though wtf. But then he never pursued me so maybe it was just infatuation on his part but then u can’t fake chemistry.... I never understood, I had so many questions. 

I decided to make a conscious effort to get over him, we spoke very very rarely. He popped up less anyway and I’d just give a little less back. Last year he broke up with his girlfriend, that girlfriend, they were together 4 years. They had, had a break in our third year and he popped up in it but it was late at night and it was more sexual in content? Anyway I tried to encourage him to come over. He was living with mostly girls at the time (keep this in mind). He declined and said it was too late. And that was the last chance we got because I was going home for the holidays. I never thought into his decline but it makes sense now I know what I know (I’ll get to it)...

He broke up with his ex for good last December, I had just got in a relationship and was happy &amp;amp; not interested in him of course. He popped up asking how I was doing in a photo snap which he hadn’t done in a long long time, he called me by my nickname he used to, and said about how this film with an actress I love had just came out and called me her. He sent a kiss to and he never sends them. I shut down the conversation quick because of course I was happy but wished him well. I don’t know what his intention was..

My relationship didn’t work out. I was single from March this year and so I heard from him again, he popped up a few times over the months, up until June. It was never to say anything much just replying to my insta stories, once to compliment my baking &amp;amp; hash-tagged  “wifey material “ - which makes him sound like something he is not, not his style but whatever. He again popped up about house party the app and said he would join me one time but that he was being lazy that night still in bed and I joked if his hands were tired..... idk why I made it sexual and put myself in a sexual frame. He could have been trying to spark up what we had, that had been buried by everything but after sleeping together, it was too scary to go back to what we had - at least for me, being sexual or playful was the only way from then I felt comfortable with. Maybe I led him to forget me and what connection we had.....

The conversation died quickly anyway just like how every pop up before was, just that : a pop up... i wondered why I hadn’t heard from him since June ... Yesterday for some reason I randomly thought of his old girl flat mates and went to their instas.. only to find..... he is now in a relationship with her. I believe so anyway, she has his name in her insta bio - not with a heart or whatever but just as a tag “@name”. Nothing else in her insta bio, nothing on his insta and nothing on fb. It destroyed me to learn this. I thought I was over him.. there couldn’t have not been an overlap be it emotional when he was living with her and still with his girlfriend, right? No wonder he didn’t come to mine that night. 

I’m so confused because I’m certain we have something and now I feel so fucking delusional to think that. Im someone who doubts if someone likes me, yet i couldnt have been any more sure he liked me. He never played games or manipulated me in any way. I’m very paranoid about that sort of thing.. You know when you FEEL something in your gut when you meet someone, you just know, that shit can’t be faked

I’m so confused though. i did set myself up for this, I made myself be just a sexual being. Maybe he tried getting more out of me giving he kept popping up and not just sexual. I mean, even tho the connection was extremely powerful if he felt even a fraction of what I did , I was a bit of a baby that year. I was young and immature. So even if he did feel something he would not have wanted to be with me with good reason, I wasn’t ready. 

it sucks he will never get to see how I am now. He lives about 4 hours from me and we have no friends in common so no chance we will ever bump into each other. That’s it. 

The fact he repeated what happened first year tho makes me feel like i was legit nothing to him. How he replied in second year when I confessed my feelings.... did he ever like me. Just so many why’s. My friends say everything aside, it doesn’t matter whether we had something, would i want to be with a cheat? My answer is that the word cheat doesn’t feel like it applies or he’s not a real meaning of one because of the context of it. Maybe I’m delusional about this too. But does anyone understand what I mean when I say the relationship wasn’t really real so it’s not a reflection of him in one? Is it fair to say?
Yes the cheating showed lack of morals. But it can be excused , it wasn’t reflective of him in a relationship because it wasn’t really real..., it was a reflection of the situation. 
So that question doesn’t help , nothing does ..

I thought I was fully over him, why is it that when I find out he’s in a relationship, the feelings come flooding in!! ... i guess because I know him, I know he feels pressure to settle down , he feels pressure about everything else in his life at 24. He’s always cared about how he appears, not in a cocky way but in a slightly insecure way, this girl is on par with him in that she is career driven like him and they have similar backgrounds. I know this is it for him. He only has long term relationships.

The feelings are quite intense it makes me question whether I’m just a bloody lunatic and romanticist. The fact I still have strong feelings for him 3 years after we parted and he didn’t pursue me , after confessing to him my feelings &amp;amp; having him not say much, given that I must be psycho enough to have made it all up? I feel like even in my forties I’ll look back at him. I just want to tell him to stop and that he’s making a mistake not being with me😂

Edit:  when I returned from Australia , he wanted to meet up to say goodbye, he was due to and move back home . He also said he’d be up for meeting in a few years time. When we met up to say goodbye, it had been like a year since we had last saw each other and the connection wasn’t really there?? It was awkward and didn’t flow. I don’t understand why I’m not over him ?",/r/dating_advice/comments/k5b7ay/still_in_love_with_my_old_uni_flatmate_4_years/,2

He agreed and said that he will be there in case I change my mind.

Weeks later, I contacted him again and we talked even more (he asked me how’s my relationship going) until I broke up finally with my ex because it has become really toxic. 

About two months later since that day, I’m still talking to this guy everyday via the messaging app. We never face-timed or called but I’ve been sending him voice notes. We told each other many things, send whatever pictures and weirdly, to this day we didn’t ran out of things to talk about: past relationships, jobs, preferences, weird things about our day, nothing sexual though. Lately, he opened up about why he hated LDR but might want to give it a try if it’s worth it and mentioned how he wanted to visit my country soon. 

I’m quite curious and a little bit confused if there’d be a chance that he might be into me or he just likes the idea of having me as a friend? Was him still talking me at this point means he likes me too? Or am I officially stuck in the virtual friend zone.

97,k6w3od,dating_advice,Sat Dec  5 01:21:21 2020,I (M20) am in love with this (F19) girl and I can't tell if she likes me back or if she's just toying with my feelings.,"Okay, so I'm from Britain and I just started school in America last January. I've been pretty successful romantically/relationship wise and have had several long-term relationships and one night stands in the past. I've only ever fallen in love with one other girl before, however When I confessed my feelings to her, she told me that she only liked me as a friend and I found out later on that she was just using me to make her ex jealous. 


This dealt a big blow to my self-confidence and shook my idea of what I think is right or wrong in relationships, because we seemed to be getting along amazingly for a long time and we became extremely close and I felt we had a bond but it turns out I was just imagining all of it and she was just keeping me around for her ego. I was devastated, as this really hurt my self confidence and my relationships in the future. However, this was two years ago and I've recovered since then. But I feel like it's happening again and I'm not ready for the pain to be flooding through again.


I met this girl back in January, and there was an instant attraction, we flirted a lot and she would laugh at my jokes very hard and talk about us going out together. We have a very similar sense of humor which is very important to me, we are also equally strange in the things we like/appeals to us. She's a bit of a party girl/very social and knows many guys around campus, one of which picked her up on the first night we met.


We kept seeing each other and talking throughout the year, I had learned she was single so I decided to ask her out for a screening of a Month Python film and she said yes because we both like them, however I didn't get her phone number and I wind up messaging her on Instagram some time later but she didn't read the message the day before the screening so we never went out.


She apologized and said that she doesn't read her Instagram messages and asked if I want another form of communication, she gave me her phone number and I texted her if she wanted to come to a party I was at for Valentine's but she said she had to take a raincheck.


Some time after, she wrote me a letter in French (a language that I spoke but she didn't) and left it in my backpack while I was gone She had used Google Translate, the letter was more or less flirty and concise but nothing real I left her a letter in French in exchange and she appreciated it, we laughed about it. Some time after she invited me to her room which I took as a sign that she wanted intimacy When I showed up, she hugged me. Then another time she asked that I come over and hang out at her room, so I did. But her roommate was there so I couldn't do anything about it.


Now, all of this seems pretty straightforward. She likes me, right? The problem was that she was very social and had a lot of guy friends on campus who would say hi to her, she has multiple photos with a lot of guys at parties but none on her Instagram. She doesn't have a boyfriend and I'm not sure if she was sleeping around or not, but I was scared that she was this intimate with a lot of guys not just me and I didn't want to become just another guy for her to sleep with. To be fair, I'm not sure she was sleeping with anyone, she would hang out mostly with her girl best friends and take pictures with them, but when she would be out partying she would take pictures with guys and hang out with them which is mostly harmless I felt.


Until we both went to the same party, at that point I had asked to come into her room because I wanted a chance to confess my feelings to her as I had really started liking her at this point and she was the only girl on campus that I found to be interesting and funny, I was a bit too straightforward because I got shit advice from a friend that I was cou about liking her up untill that point. We had gotten really close and she entrusted in me some very personal things about her life so I felt like asking her out again would be too casual so I wanted to tell her and then hopefully kiss her because that's what I wanted to do when she asked me to her room but I couldn't because of her roommate. She said she wasn't in her room and was irritated by how straightforward I was, saying I was a bit forceful later on. 


She also learnt that I had a one night stand on Valentine's and had a public falling out with my roommate for bringing a girl who doesn't go to our school nd was clearly upset at me, calling me an idiot for picking a fight with my roommate but I felt that she was a bit jealous/upset at me for sleeping with someone else.


Then we went to the same party one time...I instantly saw her when I was with my friend, she was beautiful and she wore a really low-cut tank top. She asked if we wanted to do tequila shots and I said yes, we did some tequila shots and she asked if I wanted to do body shots off of her, I said yes and then I did it. She then took a picture of the two of us for her Snapchat for some reason. Afterwards, I had went upstairs and when I came down I saw her grinding on another guy (and then another guy, both of them quite older) and I felt heartbroken. I felt cheated, I thought to myself that she does this to all the guys and that she was a bit of a promiscuous party girl, only I never got to first base with her even. She then continued to dance and get drunk, I thought maybe she wanted me to ask her to dance, so I did but she said that her and her roommate are going downstairs to dance together. It seemed like a rejection to me.


Despite this, I knew she had lost a pair of yellow sunglasses I had bought for her at the party and she was very upset by it. She told me at the party that she couldn't find them and kept searching for them with her friends. Because of how I feel towards her, even though I had just saw her dancing with some other dudes but not with me, I was pathetic and still got them for her. After the party ended, I told the bartender that if he found a pair of yellow sunglasses that he should text me. He did, and I got the sunglasses and dropped them off at her room with a more telling her not to lose them again, dumbass. She didn't know it was me until I told her and she thanked me and called me her hero.


Then Covid happened and we all had to go online for the rest of the school year, so I stopped seeing her. We kept moderately in touch over the summer. I just checked up on her here and there. I tried to move on by dating someone new and I was in a relationship for 5 months throughout the summer and after but I never felt satisfied or happy with the girl I was with, I tried to move on and get over her but I just couldn't and when the new school year started, I saw her after she called out to me from across the street and came running just to talk to me. I felt like we could maybe work out and I wasn't over her, so I broke up with my girlfriend and became single for awhile.


I tried reaching out to her again but she had moved off-campus in the same town our college was in so I ran into her very rarely and whenever I would text her she would respond instantly but it would be short and to the point, indicating that she was just being nice but didn't want to ignore my messages. This was really frustration as I had felt she was giving me all sorts of mixed signals and I didn't know what to do. Because of Covid, there were no more parties and she wasn't hanging out at bars or raves anymore. She became very focused on school and pretty much was always studying when I saw her at the library. She's also pretty smart.


Because she wasn't very responsive, I started dating another girl for about two months but it ended right around early November. Starting last month I started seeing more of her at the library. We started talking and we were instantly clicking together and flirting again. We would have long awkward pauses of silence followed by insistent laughter because of the awkward silence. I would look into her eyes and see her pupils dialted and I saw her playing with her hair multiple times while we're talking. She confided in me that her mum thought she was a lesbian because she doesn't date. I asked her why she doesn't date and she said that it's because she's so busy and back in high school she had unreasonably high standards that no guy would match up to.


I wondered then if she just likes having fun and flirting with guys or if she was genuinely interested in me. I was stomped, I had started falling for her and I hated it but I couldn't get over it. The problem is that I'm a pretty cold guy in general, I don't feel a lot thighs that often but when I do they're almost always in strong bursts. My love for her without knowing if she's genuinely interested or not...hurt. I don't know how to explain it because I've seldom felt like this before, but I felt pain for some reason that I couldn't reason or explain and I just want the pain to go away. I'm scared that if I confront her with my feelings she'll go away and we can't be friends anymore and I rationalized my fear to myself as saying I just need more time to convince her to fall in love with me.


Over the last month we've been studying together a lot at the library, flirting and staying up late. She told me that she really enjoyed talking to me. She would often get up for her chair and sit/stand next to me to show me something or tell me something in confidence. We hit it off again, and one night she asked if I wanted a ride back to my dorm. I said okay, and she gave me a ride back and we kept flirting on the way to my dorm and at my door. I tried to look for an opening to kiss her but there wasn't one so I had to go. She gave me a ride two days later as well, both times she herself asked if I wanted a ride.


We kept hitting it off til after Thanksgiving, she decided to stay on campus after Thanksgiving and so did I. I told her that I was contemplating leaving America for next semester and studying remotely online from home in Britain, which means we couldn't see each other til next fall. She seemed very sad and disappointed the first time I told her that and the second time I told her she said I should stay and gave a convoluted answer as to why but she genuinely seems like she wants me to stay for next semester. And I would do that if I knew we have a chance of working out, but I'm still scared that I'm just a pawn to her and she just likes the attention I give her.


She gave me a ride again last week and she brushed my arm for no reason, she also told me that she hasn't dated anyone at our college and when I asked her to clarify what's dating she said that when she makes a conscious decision to say ""we're in a relationship"" with someone, she says it normally takes her like two weeks to decide. Saying that the first two weeks are more or less just getting to know someone and she considers it ""talking"" rather than ""dating"" I asked her if she's asexual (as a joke) and she thought I asked if she was sexual, to which she responded that she doesn't sleep around and seemed offended when she thought that was what I meant.


Two nights ago, I was at the library and I saw her car outside but she wasn't in our usual spot, I went downstairs and I saw her studying with another guy. She said hi to me and I said hi back but I was a bit irritated by it. She and the guy then left two hours later and she gave him a ride as well, which hurt when more. I had never seen this guy before, or seen her with this guy or any other guy at the library or anywhere else for the entire semester so I was a bit relived and my fears about her being a promiscuous party girls were somewhat calmed. But after seeing her with this guy and giving him a ride afterwards as well, these fears came back up again. And suddenly I didn't feel very special. The only reason I didn't ask her out this semester or confessed my feelings for her is because she told me she's very busy with school and she doesn't have time for a relationship. But I thought she liked me, and maybe my fears about her just liking the attention and jerking guys around was true. After all, this is the girl that has dozens of photos with guys on her phone for some reason and danced with two random older guys at a party instead of dancing with me.


After I saw them leave, I went to my friend's place to tell her how I was feeling and ask for advice. After about an hour, I left my friend's place and as I was walking back to my dorm I saw her and the guy in her car and she was right near her home (he was still with her, she hadn't dropped him off yet and they had left the library over an hour ago). She saw me and was surprised, then she asked me if I wanted a ride as well. It was cold and I thought it'd be interesting to listen in to their relationship dynamic, so I said yes and got in. I asked her ""where are you guys going"" and she said: ""home"". I know he's not her roommate because she's living with her best friend, and I don't know whether or not she meant she's dropping him off first and then she's going home or they're both going back to her place, since she was on the street that her home was on when she saw me I assumed the latter and now I am convinced that she's having sex with him or at least had sex with him last night. They didn't seem that flirty or close to me, although they did have a few laughs and seemed pretty casual with one another. She dropped me off at my place and then went away. To add insult to injury, the guy isn't even that attractive, he's 5'7 and wears thick rim dark glasses and wears overly baggy clothes and gold sneakers like a fuck boi. Meanwhile I'm 6'1, I work out, I have an accent, I have a beard, I speak three languages, I have two nationalities, and I play both the guitar AND the saxophone and yet I was never invited to go ""home"" with her any of the times she's given me a ride.


So, this is the story up until this point. I have a very major decision coming up regarding whether I want to stay on-campus for next semester or go home. I don't know if she's sleeping with this guy or slept with him or not, but it seems like it. And if that is the case then this just proves my suspicions about her being a promiscuous party girl who likes to toy with guys' emotions are true. And I would have fallen in love with someone that can never make me happy and that would never really appreciate me. Her signals were very effective and she managed to make fall in love with her and not stop thinking about her even when I was in two other relationships. We have 15 days before the semester draws to a close and she goes home and I either go home or stay for next semester. What do you think, Reddit? Based on everything I've said and everything she's done. Does she like me? Is she screwing around and toying with my feelings? Should I tell her how I feel and risk being vulnerable and rejected, possibly causing some considerable damage to my self-esteem and confidence for a long time or should I hold out and get her to tell me how she feels and/or make her fall in love with me to be exclusive with me. Ladies, when a girl says or does these things. 1) Is she sleeping around? 2) Does she want me to tell her how I feel?

TL;DR

I really like this girl (maybe even love her) and she seems very flirtatious and intimate with me. I tired asking her out before and even though she said yes plans fell through. I'm scared to tell her how I feel because I think she does the same thing with other guys and she just likes the attention from me and doesn't want anything serious. However, there's been a lot signs and mixed signals that she likes me but I don't know if I'm interpreting them as her liking me because that's what I want or because it's the truth. I can't tell if I'm overconfident or underconfident. I heard girls like keeping guys around for the attention and last time I was in a situation like this and confronted a girl I loved about my feelings she shut me down and I felt heartbroken and rejected. I can't tell if this is like that or if I just have PTSD and don't want to go through the same pain again. I know that you can never be sure until you ask but there's several hints/weird things that are specific to us that I feel like Reddit needs to read to help me figure out what to do and what situation am I in? I also can't tell if she's sleeping with some other guy or she's just friends with him, she's more intimate/close with me but an interesting encounter the other day made me suspect that she's the type of person who sleeps around and doesn't want a real relationship even though she told me that she isn't.",/r/dating_advice/comments/k6w3od/i_m20_am_in_love_with_this_f19_girl_and_i_cant/,13

We’re always having good time when together but after that when I leave we barely text. Just very few texts on 1, 2 days a week. Is it just him or it’s a normal thing when dating American guys? One more thing is that he talked about and made plans but didn’t follow them and it happened twice. We haven’t talked about “what are we” yet. We’ve been dating for like two months only but he told me he’s not seeing other people. I’m fine with taking things slow but the lack of communication between every time we meet sometimes bothers me. Plus one time I saw him opening a pretty girl’s Instagram (with a profile pic of her ass) and that made me start to think a bit cause I’m not following guys’ Instagram just to please my eyes.

So yeah I’m happy to hear all the advice and tips from you guys. Thanks for reading.",/r/dating_advice/comments/k7qa1g/tips_on_dating_american_guys/,3
64,k8y37c,dating_advice,Tue Dec  8 07:12:31 2020,I posted this up on the subreddit,"just want to vent

I’ve posted up here before, for lack of people in my actual life that could listen to me. You see, I am a single mom of adult children, it’s not like I could go to them with my feelings about another romantic failure. I have “friends” but I don’t feel comfortable talking to anyone about these things. I also have sisters, but honestly, my family is so fake, I can’t go to any of them when I’m feeling like this. I tell myself every week that I’m going to put myself back in therapy, which I should, but I’m a big procrastinator, and I neglect many things in my life that I shouldn’t. All this being said, I know I’m not perfect, but I think I deserve to be loved, I think that love can save me. Real love, not one based on what I can do for the guy, which is the kind of love I’ve had before. I only had one person really love me in the way that I wanted, but the tragedy is that I’m an American, and he’s a Swede, and he had to go back to his country, and while we did plan on him coming back, he didn’t, and I can understand why, I mean, especially with the way things are here now, and lack of a medical system that is free and efficient, he could not be here for long. He too suffers from anxiety and depression as do I. 
It seems like that’s the type of guy that I always attract. Also men that are at least 12 years younger than I am, I’m 49, I look younger and act younger than my chronological age, so I attract 30 something men, which, to be honest, I like. 
Ok, so the reason I am writing here today is because I’m angry and I need to let it out into the either. See, I met this guy about 2 months ago on Tinder. I always go back to the first time we spoke, ( or texted). Well. It was great, more than great, it felt like a real connection, which for me is rare. I mean I connect with and have connected with other men, but he felt like just a perfect match, well he wasn’t perfect nor I but our conversation was flowing, we have so much in common, you get the gist. It wasn’t even a very sexual conversation, it was pure, and just so nice. We decided to meet that Sunday. We had been talking since Thursday pretty non stop, I felt like I was on top of the world. When we met in real life, it felt just as good and right. We met in Coney Island. Before going on the train, I made the first move to kiss him, and we made out almost getting to the platform, I loved it. We also made out on the train, it felt so good. He told me that he’d delete his profile on Tinder because he found what he was looking for ( his words).  I tell you, I know how stupid this sounds, but I believed him, and he did intact delete the profile, but what happened after that is why I’m here. We met one more time after that, it was another great night, just talking, making out, I had my period so I couldn’t do much more.
Now all along he had been telling me about how he just got out of a relationship ( 10 years on and off). He has a 4 yr old daughter with her. He asked me to go slow with him, and it was hard for me to reign myself in, but I did it. I did my best to keep our conversations kind of platonic, I (tried) to keep flirting at a minimum, but also worried that when I’d flirt, he wouldn’t flirt back and when I asked him about it, he said that he isn’t very “sexual” He told me he has a low/medium libido, which was hard for me to understand since the man has never been single since the age of 19. I accepted this, and just said, if I’m patient, things will come around. I know his ex does not want him back, so, I’m not jealous of her and know that if I am with him, I have to deal with her and the kid, which is fine because as I’ve stated, I have 3 kids so, all that is ok. Now, weeks we’re passing, we haven’t seen or hung out with each other in weeks. I live in Gravesend Brooklyn, he lives in Harlem, it’s a long train ride away, neither one of us has a car, so, the fear of catching Covid started taking over, although, he has to go to work and interact with people every day. I am not working at the moment, so I’m home most of the time now. He does not want to ride the train to get down here, which is understandable. I told him I’d be willing to go to him, he doesn’t want me doing that. He never said it, but it’s been heavily implied. I offered to take him food on Thanksgiving ( which was also my birthday) but he said he was going to be by himself all night. 
Unbeknownst to him, since he is a FB friend, I can track where he is ( I know it’s kind of creepy) but when you’ve been lied to by as many men as I have, you’d do it too. Well, he said that he was “home” but the tracker on FB said that he was in Rochester for a few hours. Since he probably doesn’t know that I keep tabs on him, I could not confront him about lying to me about that. I’m thinking he probably lied because I had said something to him the previous Saturday about him going to a pre Thanksgiving celebration in Queens, and when he told me that, I asked him “And you weren’t afraid of Covid, in Queens?   To this he answered ( defensively) that he was given a ride to Queens and if he didn’t get a ride, he wouldn’t have gone. 
So anyway, let’s fast forward to last Sunday. I had written him a long text, because I really wanted to know where we were at. I told him that I did not want to be strung along,and other issues I had with him that I had not discussed with him before. He told me that, he did not want to string me along, he wanted for us to remain platonic friends and that maybe down the line that we could date.I understood, even though I was hurt, but I agreed to stay friends. 
We were still texting each other just about every day,  which was ok, now, last Thursday, he told me that he has Therapy. I texted him ( not to pry about what was said, I know that’s private). But just to ask him how it went. Also, Thursday is his day with his daughter and I just wanted to ask how he was basically, which we did pretty much every day. He answered that Therapy was fine a d that he wasn’t going to go into detail about it, which was fine, because that’s not what I expected. After that, he’s kind of gone silent. I texted him on Saturday night, we text pics and memes and stuff like that, and I texted him about a show he was interested in, and I said he can watch it on HBO because there’s a free trial at the moment. He did not respond. He’s had activity on his FB page, so I know nothings wrong with him, and he’s posted up pics and stuff, but he has not texted me, not even to say hi. The last time was a humorous response to a pic I sent him about my Christmas tree. That was Saturday night. Now I know what you’re thinking, it’s Monday, what’s the big deal?  Well, he always texts me back, we have been talking for 2 months straight with minimal interruption. So for me it’s “odd” that he would all of a sudden just not text me. Also, and yes, you’re going to judge me, but he is a FB friend. He never responds to any of my posts, or “likes” them or anything.I asked him about this behavior in my letter to him. He says to me, that he his a silent observer, which is a lie. He “likes” and even puts hearts on other women’s posts. These are not his friends either, these are “chicks” that are random. I started noticing that he started gaining FB friends, and it’s these random women, and he seems to to “like” their pics..... I know how petty this sounds, but it’s an observation that I’ve noticed and that he’s lied to me about and it’s not like I can confront him in it, because as it stands, I’m just a friend, I have no right to say anything, if I tell him that I’ve been hawking his activity, he will probably get mad. But here I am, with this information, and I can’t do a thing about it. Today he posted up pics and one chick in particular put a heart on his pics and commented and here I am fuming about it and I got so mad that my hands were shaking and believe me, I’m not the jealous type but I guess I am now, I hate this. It feels better to vent it out though. Please don’t judge me too harshly, I know some of the stuff I do is borderline creepy, but it’s information that is readily out there. I can’t help it if I’m suspicious and I snoop. I’m more mad at myself about this, I wish I hadn’t invested my emotions into this guy, he has issues, some that he can’t help. I have my own issues too. I’m just really sad because I really really wanted us to work. To be honest, I hope that something can work with us, I like him but I don’t think he wants me, it’s just a mess, and my emotions are on point right now. So, there it is. Who ever reads this, just know that, I’m just a lonely woman who really wants love, and a lot of times I look for it in the wrong places and at people who are not willing to invest their emotions on me. So, thank you for letting me vent.",/r/dating_advice/comments/k8y37c/i_posted_this_up_on_the_subreddit/,2

We enjoyed each other's company, we cooked for each other, laughed at the dumb reality TV show (Love island) we've been following, danced naked in my bedroom, had great sex and woke up to lazy brunches. We also made tentative plans for road trips, weekend trips or Christmas trips.

Despite all these, I have been so afraid to be rejected every time I initiated dates (except the first date when I had no expectation at all). Even though she proved me wrong by accepting all the 5 dates, I am still afraid that she would reject me anytime soon. I will be overthinking our differences like, maybe she's jewish and i'm not religious? Maybe she's American and i'm Chinese? or maybe she's applying for medical school and I'd like to settle down here in this city? Maybe she likes me to text her everyday and I haven't been? or I'd be so afraid that this doesn't work out and I had to go back to the painful online dating again (I've went on more than 30 dates this year).

Also, she is not verbalizing how she feels about me, and on our latest date I said that I haven't been using dating apps since I met you and her reply was ""we're just getting to know each other"".

29,k9px9c,dating_advice,Wed Dec  9 13:01:52 2020,How to know if youre Settling vs being Realistic?,"ok, this is going to be a long one...

I am a 27 year old woman, five months into a relationship with a 41 year old man. We met on reddit (seems to be where I turn to for everything these days, anyway). He lives in America, I live in Canada. He tried very hard to get me to chat off reddit and once he got my number was diligently attentive basically 247 showing lots of interested in a serious relationship with me and doing all he could to help me with my life from afar (he tried to buy me dinner the night we met via paypal). Finally he convinces me to meet him in Mexico and after getting over hesitation of him being an axe murderer we have a really lovely 13 days together. We continue to talk daily and I am considering doing a trial 6-month move-in with him while I sublet my place in April. We are also going to Brazil together for xmas - all on his dime (I don't have a job). He is ready for marriage. I am not. He asks about my commitment and where this is headed often.

He is the the kindest man Ive met. But thats where the attraction for me sort of ends. He is overweight and short than I am used to even though he isnt shorter than me. He is older than ideal for me max 35 would probably be better. He is in 200k of student debt because he failed med school. He is currently in school to become a therapist and has been working in mental health for the past 8 years. He lives with his mother which I really am put off by. He does Everything he can for me and never makes me feel like I am not enough. All he asks is for reciprocal love or for me to be honest with him that hes not my cup of tea. I don't want to stay but I don't want to go even more.

I have been single for 5 years without even a single bite. The guys I was into for that whole time have not been into me. The last serious request that wasnt someone who only wanted sex was at age 22. I am decently pretty, not overweight. But I have many personality flaws. For one I have never held down a job for more than 3 months despite turning 28 next month. I have crippling depression and have had since age 3. At this point I cant even tell if I have brain damage or not because I cant even remember simple words. I have virtually no friends. People don't generally want to be around me. Other than him who very much enjoys my company laughs at my jokes listens to my ridiculous rants etc. I have a lot of anger and honestly am low-key a toxic person energy wise. I have no degree, have failed multiple times trying to get one.

I am Trying to get seriously realistic understanding of the difference between settling and being realistic. I'm not crazy about him but nobody is crazy about me. That said, he does not want somebody who is picking him over nothing and has said as much many times. He said hell still be my friend if we break up after hes taken time to heal. I'm afraid if I lose him I'll face another 5 years single. Its very conceivable. If not longer, afterall, I'm still in my 20s now so this probably is as good as it gets, especially looks wise.

What do I do?

I'm hoping not to get answers that are overly skewed in either the male or female perspective such as Im worth Everything because I'm a woman or that Im worth Nothing because Im a woman sort of shit. I didnt envision ever being in this situation. I guess I blame myself for not making myself into a person with enough good qualities that the people who'd like me Id easily like back. When I was younger I was married once before to someone that I did have mutual admiration for. But my life has basically been going downhill for a long time A couple people said settle on him for now, do better later. But this is no way to treat another human. I deserve noting better but that treatment myself if I do this.

98,kaj60q,dating_advice,Thu Dec 10 19:04:43 2020,"Emotional Breakup with Him, Rebound Sex with Her?","Last Sunday I (21F) was dumped by this guy (31M) I was seeing for two months. I use the word dumped but it was hardly a traditional relationship. We were extremely emotionally intimate, cuddled, and slept in the same bed when he stayed over but he would always rebuff my sexual advances beyond a chaste kiss, despite considerable sexual tension. He also refused to officially take on the titles of girlfriend and boyfriend, despite all our mutual friends and even strangers on the street thinking we were an item. Even given what was lacking I considered it to be an entire relationship, without sex or the label (unusual I know, typically these days it's sex without emotion). 

The dissolution was caused by an honest conversation I initiated about why he didn't want to have sex with me or be my official girlfriend. He told me he couldn't get any more involved right now because of his mental health and that he let himself go too far in the emotional and non-sexual physical intimacy in the first place. It stung, of course, but I care about him and I can get to a place where I accept that. Now I need to focus on taking care of myself instead of him. 

Which brings me to the topic of the title. The bottom line is this: The lack of sex in our brief relationship is making me worried that I could hurt myself by sublimating my rejected desire for him into a fling with someone else. 

We have a mutual friend (33F) who is knockout gorgeous. She has a lot of casual sex and is seemingly with a new guy every other week. She definitely prefers men but she's admitted a relationship with a woman when she was my age. Even before my situation with this guy fell apart she'd flirted with me pretty hard while the three of us were out drinking and doing blow. I rebuffed those advances because of my involvement with the guy, despite his admission to me that it turned him on to have his girl fuck other women. I'm definitely attracted to her but said no because I didn't want to go farther in a casual encounter with a female friend than I'd gone with him. I would fantasize about a three-way sometimes but I kept all of those thoughts in my head because that can be so complicated in practice, and at the end of the day I wanted to be in a monogamous relationship with him. 

But now he's out of the picture. 

The water in her NYC apartment building was shut off this week. So as a close friend I offered that she could come over and use my shower tonight. She said she's bringing wine and we're going to have a girls night with mud masks and stuff like that. This is one of the first times we're hanging out without the guy who dumped me also being there (we were inseparable). I could see it going one of two ways. Either we could have a true girls night, keep it strictly friendly, and she'll counsel me through the breakup. Or we could get really drunk and I could somehow end up trying to get over him by getting under her.

So I need your advice reddit. Should I just be honest and tell her that she's hot but I can't be with her while losing him is so fresh? Or am I just making something out of nothing and I should go for it to help me move on? I'm trying to find a mature way to handle this.

39,kcdxl1,dating_advice,Sun Dec 13 18:52:51 2020,What the heck is going on,"Before I go in I’d just like to preface that I understand all situations are different and you won’t ever know until you directly communicate and ask someone directly but I’d like to air this out to get outsiders’ perspectives first. 

I’m an American girl and I recently met a French boy on Bumble. He’s around my age and due to the lockdown he invited me over for dinner one night. He cooked, we watched a movie and hooked up and I stayed the night. In the morning we hung out a bit and had breakfast before I left. It was normal to me and I felt nothing special of it so I sort of mentally friend zoned him. Two nights later (a few days before I was scheduled to leave for the US) he invites me over to hang out and since I’m bored why not. This time was completely different and so much more dynamic (likely due to my level of comfort). We drink and watch another movie (the entirety of it this time) and then hook up. He’s incredibly real and yet at the same time romantic. He’ll compliment me in ways that come off more as observations/matter of fact so they seem more genuine. Essentially on s’entend bien. I jokingly said oh you just want to get into my pants (meaning nothing of it btw) and he said noo it’s not just that. He also has done incredibly tender things like put a bandaid on me when I was just asking for one. I’m used to guys being easy to read or having a very obvious flaw that allows me to understand where I stand. It’s hard because he seems so normal and well adjusted but we also click. 

The one thing that “concerns” me is his one comment about enjoying having sex with strangers because it’s novel. To be fair his English is not perfect so I won’t assume too much. 

Now I know this is a lot for someone I’ve just met two times. I plan on seeing him again after I return and I plan on dating in the meantime but I like him a lot. We’ve been casually texting and sending each other voice notes. He left me on read but he seems to rarely check his phone. 

I really like this guy and I’m stuck ruminating in my thoughts. There are cultural differences in dating so I really don’t want to jump the gun. Part of me is obsessing because I’m procrastinating other things in my life but not knowing is also frustrating me. Thoughts?",/r/dating_advice/comments/kcdxl1/what_the_heck_is_going_on/,2
2,kd0epn,dating_advice,Mon Dec 14 18:05:25 2020,I’m not sure how this date went. Does he like me?,"Hi everyone,

If anyone follows my Reddit posts, they’ll know that I was seeing a guy for a few months who claimed he was over his ex but was indeed not over her at all, yet he used me for the emotional support, great sex, etc. all the meanwhile going on dates with other women behind my back after telling me he wanted us to be exclusive without the bf/ gf label just yet. Needless to say, after discovering that he was lying to me, I dropped him.

I started talking to someone new but I’m not sure if he’s all that into me. Before we met, he wasn’t the best texter... he would respond to my texts every few hours, and before we met we FaceTimed. We FaceTimed for hours and after our FaceTime call, he still texted me every few hours but I felt like he was way more interested after FaceTiming. We went on a first date the day before yesterday, and it was a little bit of a train wreck. We planned on going to dinner but the roads were blocked because of a protest in dc so we went to a lounge where it was too loud, where we sat awkwardly for a bit because we couldn’t hear each other. We finally found a place that wasn’t too loud where we had a drink and laughed and talked. He kept smiling, he touched me a little bit, flirted, etc. he even said that it was “good vibes” the only issue is that he’s very much into working out and he told me on our FaceTime call that he’s into “thick women”  but I’m the complete opposite. I’m 105 pounds B cup boobs and small ass- even though it has a nice shape. Also on our date when we talked about working out, I joked about how small I was and he kept reassuring me by saying that “it’s not a bad thing,” even though I didn’t need the reassurance. He also told me that I could get bigger if I wanted to- which I didn’t really take all that well... but then he said that girls like to be smaller because it’s a good thing. He also said that he doesn’t meet up with most of his hinge matches in person because he’s picky. So I guess that should make me feel good? After that, we went to his place b/c during covid there’s nowhere else we can really go. We just cuddled, listened to music, watched the office and he told me to stay over and just “sleepover” before I headed out to nyc the next day for two weeks. I left, and before I went into my Uber he said “I’ll see your fine ass soon.” He texted me the next day around noon to wish me safe travels and responded to my text a few hours later to ask if I made it there. His texts are still very spaced out, and after our first date I was hoping he’d be really into me but I don’t know why I’m so unsure. I responded to his text at 10 pm and I havent heard back from him yet and it’s 11 am the next day. Maybe im unsure bc of my bad experience before this guy, or maybe I’m just insecure because this guy is really jacked and I’m not toned or “thick.” Or maybe he just isn’t into me. Either way, I need help figuring this out before I waste time with someone else again only to ruin my self esteem when I find that they were just using me for sex.",/r/dating_advice/comments/kd0epn/im_not_sure_how_this_date_went_does_he_like_me/,7

38,kg7itm,dating_advice,Sat Dec 19 15:14:31 2020,Told myself I wouldn't pursue relationships until I have a job. Got a job - now what?,"Throughout highschool, I was too much of a chickenshit to ask anyone out. When I did muster up the courage to ask someone out, I was rejected because she was already seeing someone. Which was fine, because I just started Uni and wanted to focus on that. 

Throughout University, I was commuting from home (about 1hr15mins each way) so I really tried to limit my time at Uni and thus, didnt do any extra curricular activities. Also, I didnt have a job while studying, so was pretty much broke. I thought it would be weird/cringe to go on a date and spend money that I didnt earn. A pretty barren and boring Uni experience. All of my time was spent either sleeping, eating, commuting, studying, or playing games. So I told myself early on that I would try dating only when I get a job, and can pay for shit with money I earned. So for the last ~5 years, I put off dating/relationships until I was in a place I deemed worthy. It took way longer than I expected, but I finally got a job.

 And now the time has come where I am ready to date, but Im totally lost on how to actually do it. I feel like I (23M) am so behind. Most people have been in a relationship, had sex, kissed etc. Ive never even held hands romantically. How do I start dating? I live in Australia, where you can't just walk up to someone and start talking. You have to be friends first. I have friends, but theyre mostly highschool friends, because I didnt make any meaningful friendships in University. Do dating apps work well? How do I find out how attractive I am? How do I get more attractive? How do I get good pictures of me? I still live with my parents, is this a turn off? I still live 1.5 hours away from a major city, is *that* a turn off?

30,kh7wbn,dating_advice,Mon Dec 21 04:18:01 2020,I’m wondering if this bisexual crush (f23) I (m25) have was serious about cheating,"Some back story. We matched on tinder a year ago but haven’t met up yet. We do flirt with each other on social media here and there. Through her posts and stories I came to realize she is bisexual, which there is nothing wrong with. She is a drop dead gorgeous girl and so is her best friend (f23) that she’s been occasionally sleeping with for the past year (it’s very evident on Instagram and they’re open about it). She’s seen another guy earlier this year but he’s been off her posts lately so I assume they broke up. However this bisexual best friend of hers is still around even though she has a new bf. 

She has a new boyfriend now, he’s really attractive (I’m straight, but any person would agree he’s attractive) and I knew I didn’t stand a chance with her anyways (she’s smart, gorgeous, and funny). She’s still best friends with the sexy bisexual girl she use to previously sleep with. 

Anyways, she posted a story to her snapchat where she’s taking a beautiful selfie video. In the background her bisexual best friend was like “cheat on me mommy” and my crush responded “I will cheat on you babygirl” then smiled! and then her friend said “thank you” my crush proceeded to burst out laughing. Clearly they drank some alcohol too. 


What does that mean?! Is that a joke? Does it indicate she might cheat? I don’t want her to cheat but what kind of snap was that? Was confused why she posted that

Sorry English isn’t my first language, I live in America but I’m new here (she is born and brought up here, beautiful, has tattoos, into fitness and went to university)",/r/dating_advice/comments/kh7wbn/im_wondering_if_this_bisexual_crush_f23_i_m25/,7
78,khulya,dating_advice,Tue Dec 22 03:00:23 2020,Tried a quick experiment....,"So I just moved to a new state earlier this year, Oklahoma to be exact. Hopped on the dating apps. Out of almost a year of being on dating apps here, I've only met 2 women in person. Almost a full year, 2 women. One was a cute physically fit African American female psychology graduate (I'm African American myself) she was pretty cool. We continued to see each other until she graduated and moved away. Yes we did have sex the whole time and it was great, best I've had so far actually.

After we parted ways, I later met another girl from Texas, it wasn't that long of a drive so I made the drive to go see her, she was a bbw, but I was attracted to her. She was some kind of islander mixed with Native American  she was really cute. She had a kid and the kids dad is locked up for a significant amount of time. It ended up not working out cause out of nowhere she kept asking me for money while I was still trying to get to know her. I just left her alone after she tried again a few more times.


But it took forever for me to meet those two women, months of swiping, refining my profile, sending messages, getting ghosted etc. Those are my results for 2020, only meeting 2 women out of an entire year outside of my career.

I tried an experiment, I asked myself how would I fair if I drastically changed my location on the dating apps? I was bored so I tried it out, switched my location to Toronto, Canada. Same profile, same pics. Matches started coming in after a few hours, way more matches and likes, I couldn't believe it honestly. I looked through the profiles, these were attractive women, even had a few convos, was even called cute a few times lol. So if I ever somehow visited Toronto, I would hit the ground running for dating. But then reality sits in, I switch my location back to where I'm at, even spreaded the distance out to Texas.....nothing at all. I swiped so many profiles, sent so many messages, nothing. It's getting towards the end of 2020, still have yet to meet more than 2 women. I mean I can't just quit my career and go to Toronto, but considering how good my feedback was for there, I'm thinking about saving up for a 2-3 week vacation to go visit.",/r/dating_advice/comments/khulya/tried_a_quick_experiment/,8
18,kid0a1,dating_advice,Tue Dec 22 22:10:43 2020,She would be too good for me,"I met this woman a few weeks ago and we hit off. She is relatively pretty, mid 30s but with a child from a previous relationship. I usually don't go for single mom but I decided to hang out with her. She matched me on tinder and was even the one to contact me first. Plus I am much younger than her 28 years old. 

But the other she made a comment that I find strange. Basically, we were talking about dating preferences, and she made a comment that when she was younger and prettier, she probably would not have gone for me. She is Dominican, with a mocha complexion. I am African American, with a light shade.  She basically told me that her culture, especially her family, wanted her to marry a gringo (meaning a white dude) and back then she probably wouldn't have considered me. Mind you, I don't even want to be with her in the long run. 

She is clingy asf and barely give me time to breath. She is already talking about she has fallen in love with me, etc. And tbh she has nothing to offer other than her body... I am a relatively a good looking fella with a well paying job, my own house, no debt and a lot of savings.

We had sex a few times and now I am oulling after her comments but she keeps calling and texting. But I feel like she seems me as her rescuer.",/r/dating_advice/comments/kid0a1/she_would_be_too_good_for_me/,6
23,kjh5yj,dating_advice,Thu Dec 24 17:25:12 2020,Any Advice? -- We Both Took It Too Fast,"SORRY IN ADVANCE! THIS IS LONG:

I have been dating several different women off apps for the last 2 years and making some connections but in the end they either wanted more commitment too soon or things fizzled. I'm 36 (M) and my last serious relationship was about 2 years ago. I have a pretty effortless time dating and i'm good at conversation and open and honest with the women I meet -- and all this during a pandemic.

I met a woman (31) about 5 weeks ago on an app. I didn't think much of it. She was a little prettier than the girls I usually match with but we had music, movies, politics, jokes, general good vibes and other things in common along with witty banter and everything seemed to be going pretty smoothly. We went from app to text within a day and were texting pretty much every day with some natural breaks and I didn't bother her over the weekends since I knew she's super busy during the week and very career oriented.

We made plans to go on a date on the Friday after Thanksgiving. It took about a week or 2  since she was traveling a bit to visit family.  Our first date was smooth. We were both happy and laughing and just enjoying each others company. After dinner and a few drinks she began to run her fingers thru my hair and put her hand on my knee. We sort of moved closer together and kept talking and having a fun night. Finally it got a little late and I walked her to her train. We pulled off our masks and kissed. She thought we were being dangerous but smiled and kissed me back.

A  week went by. We kept chatting and everything felt great. We scheduled 2 more dates in a row. I was eager to spend more time with someone I got a great vibe from and liked. I let her know it was good to meet her and I got a good feeling from her.  She hit me up as soon as she was back in town and we decided to meet up on a Wednesday night.  This time we agreed to meet up in her neighborhood. It was snowing so she decides to just invite me to her place. I bring a bottle of wine and we order some food. We sit there chatting and talking and it feels great. She's a bit more reserved than I am. She was wearing a hoodie and jeans and keeping it casual.  After food and drinks and hours of talking and feeling good together she stands on her couch to point out some of the art on her wall. She's standing up and I spot her, holding her, we start to caress... we lay on the couch and make out. Things go rather quickly. Lusty. We're naked and on her bed within minutes. We click. We like the same kind of touching and we have amazing sex. We stay up all night cuddling and caressing and it just felt unlike anything has felt in years. I was excited. She was excited. We made a great team in the moment. Now I will admit some random drunk things were said that night that may lead to the final outcome being what it is. She laments she's not sure she wants to have kids and would rather adopt -- I'm like yeah i agree... (cool why are we talking about this?) I make a joke about moving away from NYC at some point.

We barely sleep and wake up in the morning and have sex again. She straightens up her place a bit and we go grab breakfast. I buy us breakfast and we head back to her place to hang out and eat. She opens her laptop and prepares for the daily zoom calls and work. I stick around a little and we kiss and hug goodbye. I figure this is great. I'm going to see this person again in 3 days. YES. We keep texting and chatting as normal.

Third date rolls around. She comes to my hood. We have an amazing dinner. She's still in a great mood and we're getting along as usual. Everything felt great. We walk back to my place. She comments on my art and how cool my apartment is. I have a cat. She knew this. She's slightly allergic and had taken some Claritin. We're hanging out and everything seems ok. We hang out on my couch and put on some Netflix. She seems tired and curls up on my lap and falls asleep. I eventually turn off the TV and tell her ""let's go lay down, we can just get to sleep since we're both tired."" She starts getting itchy and throat scratching and seems uncomfortable. I offer her an Uber ride home. I don't want her to stay here if she's having a reaction. She says ""no -- it's ok I want to stay"". She stays, we sleep, I give her a t-shirt to change into and make her comfortable. Something felt off though. The vibe was not right but I figured whatever one awkward night -- I'm sure we'll get thru this. 

In the morning she wakes up early and gets ready to leave because she really can't handle the cat allergy anymore. I make her a coffee and we chat and joke at my kitchen table. She takes a look at my cat and makes a joke ""Hey bud, it's you or me"" -- we laugh. I ask her when I'll see her again and she says ""we'll figure it out"" ... womp womp.

I text her over the weekend to ask how she's feeling and she's slow to respond. No worries.

I text again and no response. Finally i text her ""Hey you said you like the chase but now I feel like i've annoyed you a bit. I'm really sorry about the cat and I hope you're feeling better. Happy to see you got your christmas tree and it look beautiful, Have a great night""

She responds hours later with ""Hey haha yea things are going a little fast for me :) but I hear it’s because you care. Don’t worry about the cat. I think it’s me running a little ragged and just being  burnt out on work.""

The next morning I say, All good let's take it slow.  We don't text for 3 days. I break the silence and we start texting again, but it's very sparse. I can feel she's trying to not put much investment in our conversations.

I ask her if she has any fun plans on Friday (a week after the awkward date) and she doesn't reply.

It's been about a week now and neither of us have reached out. It's Christmas, It's New Years -- it's a dumb part of the year to get any kinds of emotions going but I just don't know what to do other than wait. Give her space. Hopefully she reaches back out to me? 

It's rare to make this sort of connection with someone. To feel like all is right in the world with the person you met to be so quickly faded? I feel like I've got whiplash.

12,kke8vv,dating_advice,Sat Dec 26 08:42:52 2020,Is it racist to not date dark skinned people because I’m worried about my family being racist to them?,"Hi! I am 23F, I want to start this off by saying I’m a medium brown myself, like the rest of my family. There’s a lot of colorism in brown communities and unfortunately I’ve witnessed my own family act this way as well.

Personally, I really dislike colorism. I feel like it does nothing for our communities except rip us apart. There are certain things I believe should be practiced only by the people of that culture, but I don’t think skin color is a good qualifier of whether a person is in that community or not.

That said!!!!! I got nothing against dark or light skinned folks. Some could call me light skinned or dark skinned I’m sure.

But I’m ngl, my family is garbage about it. It doesn’t help that we live in the Midwest and pretty much everybody but dark skinned folks enforce it. 🙄

So, being a brown person, I’ve dated one or two white folks and I’ve been treated as “the dark one” (racial jokes, slurs, seeing how far they could push me using my s/o as a shield). And I know DAMN WELL my shit ass siblings would do the same to my s/o if they were darker skinned.

I know someone is gonna say “well you need to grow some balls and defend them” but I can tell you, I’ve been on the other side of it. It still hurts. Being othered like that by your s/os family still sucks, and I just don’t want to make anyone feel the same way I did.

But recently a friend (18F) who happens to be darker skinned and I were going through the people who liked me on tinder. There was this African American man with similar interests to me, in the next city, and who was in fact pretty attractive. My friend immediately wanted me to match him and I had to quietly explain the situation to her. I feel like I hurt her feelings, and that sucks bc that’s the last thing I want, but I also don’t want to pull anyone into a shitty situation.

I’m just really struggling with the morality of my decision and I’d like to know other people’s thoughts and opinions on it.",/r/dating_advice/comments/kke8vv/is_it_racist_to_not_date_dark_skinned_people/,6
92,kl9zhs,dating_advice,Sun Dec 27 21:44:43 2020,What I wish I had known about women when I was 20,"I'm not particularly attractive. But when good-looking women do seem to take an interested in me, I'm flattered. I think they like me for *me,* for my personality, for what I do, for what I care about. Yet this is all bollocks. Women aren't interested in the man but in his assets. Read on if you care to know why.

My dad owns a big villa. One day, a good-looking young woman, whom none of our family members had ever met before, rang our door bell. My parents opened the door, and she welcomed herself in. She told my parents she was studying in the same town I was studying in. She wanted to get acquainted with us for some reason. I came down the staircase (I was visiting my parents, not living there) and the woman started flirting with me in front of my parents. It felt weird but I was flattered, too. I realized later on she didn't give a damn about me. Of course not. She just thought we were loaded. (We weren't. My dad was unemployed and my parents had no more money left in the bank.)

You see, it's all about appearances. Women will feign an interest in men but only to assess their financial situation. Is he loaded or not. Does he have a big house or not. Does he have the sort of career that will get him a good mortgage or not. Those are the questions women are thinking of when they approach you for a flirt. They don't care about *you*. They care about your *assets*. Your money. Your inheritance. Whether your dad has a big house or not. Whether you are getting that promotion or not (only if it includes a bonus package).

On a night out, I put on a suit jacket I bought for 30$ but it looked real fancy on me. As though I were an investment banker. The hottest girl in the club starts flirting with me. Big eyes. She was beautiful. We danced slowly. I gave her soft kisses down her neck to the point where she shivered, let out a moan, and clamped her legs around mine. I pushed her away. She had to go to the bathroom. She came back and I walked her to her car, we made out there, I got her number. We met again a whole week later. We made out again. But no sex. We met for a third time. This time she's very frustrated. There's something wrong but I didn't know what it was. She didn't really like me anymore, and broke off the date halfway through, and left, citing her older sister was supposedly dying of cancer! I felt terrible for her. She ran off. I tried to be supportive on the phone but she never responded to my messages anymore. I let her go. Later, I realized, I had taken her to a cheap restaurant instead of the expensive one she had been pointing at as we walked by. She didn't think I was good enough for her, financial-wise. She never had an older sister! *She only dated me because she thought I was loaded, because of that 30$ jacket I wore to the club.*

On another day, I met a tall beautiful blonde named Britney in NYC. I somehow got to talking with at some laidback private-home party. I was talking to her about startups. This was around the time Facebook acquired Instagram for a billion dollars. She asked me all sorts of questions about my tech work and it made me feel liked. I took her out to a club later that night. I thought nothing of it, but she wanted to see me again. Great! But I was a bit confused (she was way out of my league). Much later, I realized she thought I was going to be a tech billionaire someday. She didn't care about me at all. She only cared about the money she thought I was going to make.

And so on, and so forth.

The lesson is: Women don't love men. They feign an interest in men in order to get at his assetes. What women love the most is your house. The house, the house, the house. That's the big deal with women. If you want an attractive woman, you have to have a big house. Period. But they don't love men. Never have. If you want to fuck hotties, all you have to do is get the house. You could even rent one and put it on your Tinder profile &amp; lie about it. You'll get laid automatically. Try it -- picture yourself in front of luxurious real-estate and you'll get laid on Tinder every night. You tell them you're staying in a hotel ""due to renovations"". You pump her in the hotel and dump her. Spread the word your parents own a big villa. Say your uncle is in real estate who owns 1000s of yachts and houses and he's letting you live in several for free. Whatever it takes. 

I have yet to meet the first women who cares about me for *me*. I have met 10s of 1000s who only cared about me when they thought I was rich, and ignored me as soon as they found out I wasn't.

27,ko4s7r,dating_advice,Fri Jan  1 06:14:32 2021,(20M) got rejected really need advice please,"One day i was just browsing tinder and i found this girl [19] she lives in Germany and I live in the Netherlands. She had her instagram in her bio and i decided to message her because its easier then to get matched. We started talking about basic daily stuff asking how she was how her day was etc.

I found out she was heartbroken by a guy in Australia (probably a scammer) that just vanished. I made it my mission to make her feel happy again and it worked she started to cry less and she started to be happy again. At some point we started getting into eachother we called eachother pet names like honey, hun etc. and we really started to like eachother, i fell in love with her. We started sexting, sending pictures etc. and i really thought she loved me back untill one day i told her i loved her and she admited she couldnt say it back because she didnt felt the same for me. She admited she was using me for distraction mostly to not think about the Australian guy but she likes me but just doesn't loves me.

So i asked her what is she would want me to do, stay friends and keep just let it be friends with benefits or if she would want me to leave. She said she wanted me to stay. At some point we started talking about meeting up wich we eventually did I sat 6 hours in the train to her and 6 hours back. As you can expect we had sex and we cuddled and fell asleep together like real couples do. We talked about if one of us finds someone else they liked more we would stop doing what we were doing and stay friends. 

So fastforward to today. She told me she is starting to like a guy she met from her friendgroup and asked me to stop doing the sex stuff with her. Ofcourse I am heartbroken by this news but I knew this was gonna happen sooner or later. Did I my own grave by staying with her or was I right to stay with her. I truly dont know. 

it might be good to add that I am Chronicly depressed and I have PTSD and that I think about suicide alot. This girl was the first girl i trully loved and I know there are others out there but as someone that is depressed it can be hard to see this.
Right now i am struggling with my feelings and I don't know what is going to happen wich scares me the most. 

I know i wasn't the best person i could be to her but i tried my hardest to make her love me back so things would be easier. I guess some people aren't just ment to be together.",/r/dating_advice/comments/ko4s7r/20m_got_rejected_really_need_advice_please/,5
12,kouvrv,dating_advice,Sat Jan  2 11:47:12 2021,"I left town, got ghosted, months later got blocked on everything. Still can't get her out of my head. Advice please.","Hey guys, last year I was working remotely in another country where I met a fellow American. She was beautiful, nerdy, working for a non-profit and had a very calming presence. We met during a class and she ended up finding me on instagram later. We connected and planned to meet.

I was leaving the country in a couple weeks, she was aware of it, so I went into the date with no expectations. She showed up in a lovely dress and we really hit it off. I am not the kind of guy to believe in soulmates and I was having a blast as a single guy in other countries. But this woman had me shook.

We both had unique up-bringings, similar taste in music and most importantly what we wanted out of life (social work, adoption etc.) She constantly brought up sex but I always pivoted away - I didn't want her to be a nomadic hookup. She was too special to risk it.

On my last weekend we made a lot of plans. She was quite busy that week with work but she was more distant than usual. I wanted to discuss any potential for the future during a planned hike. She ended up canceling all weekend and asked me out for dinner the night before my flight. I told her I wasn't sure as I had a very busy day and I figured she just wasn't interested - if she liked me surely she would've wanted to spend the last weekend with me.

That day she messaged me for dinner but I was feeling very sad for leaving and her general lack of interest. I didn't respond. Next day as I boarded my plane I told her she was one of the most beautiful souls I've ever met and I didn't want our friendship to end. I told her I was asking her out on a date 2 months in advance when I'd be back. Silence. I never heard from her again. 

I left her a couple messages telling her I was sorry for blowing her off on my last day and I just couldn't say goodbye. Told her to stay safe during covid. No response. I didn't bother her further and planned on messaging her when I'd return to the country just in case she wasn't sure if I was serious. I messaged her friend to find out what was going on. No response. 

Over the next few months, covid blocked travel. I dated other women but kept thinking about her. I posted instagram stories that she and her friend viewed but that's it. One day after months of no contact, she blocked, unblocked and followed me again on IG. I thought nothing of it and followed her back. Still didn't want to be annoying and thought she would reach out if she wanted. A week later she blocked me on everything. 

I was incredibly confused. Other female friends said she must've liked me if she felt the need to block me after months of no contact. She was a very mature woman, I was quite surprised at why she couldn't even say she wasn't interested. Was I suppose to do something? 

I plan on being back in her town in a couple months as covid restrictions end. Will be there for remainder of the year. I am thinking about getting a friend to deliver a letter to her with some flowers. I am okay with her not being interested/available, I would love to still be friends with her if dating isn't an option. I care about her deeply and feel happy thinking she is safe and well. 

Any thoughts on her behavior? I realize I was a jerk for blowing her off on my last day but I corrected that within one day by apologizing. It's been 10 months since I heard from her and it still messes with me.",/r/dating_advice/comments/kouvrv/i_left_town_got_ghosted_months_later_got_blocked/,10
91,kpj5hn,dating_advice,Sun Jan  3 13:32:08 2021,Need some general advice on why I can't get myself a nice girl!!,"So I honestly feel I’ve got the short end of the stick, I feel like nothing will ever work out for me in a romantic point of view. I feel I can’t even get a nice lady to see me on a casual basis, let alone a life long partner or even a one night stand. End goal is a partner for life, one who will love me and have my back till the end. But I see nothing wrong with meeting some nice woman for a bit of fun or having some friends that come with obvious benefits along the way till my new partner is on the scene. But no matter what I do or try it always seems to fall short, and I can’t figure out why. This will take a little explaining so grab some snacks if you need before continuing.

Will start with some background as I feel it will help you understand my situation much better towards the end. I have aspergers, so growing up my maturity level was always several years behind my physical age. Once in my young 20’s however this problem corrected itself as I dedicated time to learning how to be social. These days I’m 34 and recently divorced (more on this later), been flying free since May 2020. I’ve put myself in social situations, joined groups for different activities, hit the bars on weekends, gotten into online dating and even had a few brave goes at flirting with some woman I liked while shopping or running everyday errands. This has got me a few first dates and some nice comments but that's about it (again little more later). I know socially I’m quite fine, few nights at the bar got me invited to some after parties, still in a lot of my group activities (EG D&amp;D and Zumba classes) and have been told by quite a few sources that I socially fit in and in no way come of as desperate, they got no reason to lie to me either. 

A little on the past now to help you see where I’m coming from. My first GF was when I was 18. Let’s say she only went out with me to break my values and ended up cheating on me for half of our 8 month relationship with my best friend. This shut me down for about 4 years as I retreated into video games and church life. Before that my school life wasn’t much better, always moving around and never settling in one place made it hard to keep friends, if I made any at all. Was always the social outcast at school, being a little chubby didn’t help. Dropped out of school before finishing grade 10 as I just couldn’t handle it anymore (met first GF at tafe). 

I finally left home around 25 and moved to the city, this is where I finally lost my virginity…… to a dam escort…. Spent the next 6 months unable to get myself any ladies and only settling for escorts. Burned through about 6 or 7K to achieve this, not a part of my life I’m proud of. I finally met my exwife not too long after this and we pretty much skipped the dating phase, engaged within 3 months, both 28 at the time. Looking back I was desperate and she was too in a way, and I know she had some kind of love for me, not too sure now what that was, but something was there. We stayed engaged for 18 months before getting married in 2015. After we got married things started decaying at a very slow speed. She was lazy, didn’t give much affection, double standards, emotionally manipulated me and the list goes on, could do a whole post on just this marriage to be honest. The sex was one of the worst (not the most, but up there). On average once every 6 weeks to 2 months and most of the time she would open her legs, jump on her phone and give me 10 minutes to do what I needed. She never really put any effort into trying to please or pleasure me. Kisses most times had to be bargained for with chores, coffee, a massage and so on… So by this point life wasn’t looking too good, but I stayed determined I could help her while fixing us, and because deep down I thought it would never get any better. I know I’m better off right now but still wonder sometimes. The catalyst for the plunge into darkness was when we lost our one and only baby. We were about 8 weeks in when we lost it, both of us being overweight didn’t really help our chances. 

This was about 2 years before I called it quits. She went into depression and started getting worse. I tried to help her however I could, we went to counselling, I tried to help her join groups to get out more, us to both lose weight and much more. She would either try for a month or so, or outright not even try at all on all these things. Always sliding back into depression. It went from depression to attention seeking but. Always posting on Facebook about how sad things are, or using depression as an excuse on me for getting out of chores, work some days, intimacy with me and the list goes on. Anytime we did things she wanted however, I cook and do the chores, holidays, go to nights out with her friends or family or anytime she got away with staying in bed all day while I did everything she suddenly wasn’t depressed. 9 months before I did leave was my first threat to leave. She picked herself up for about a month and went right back. So May this year (2020) I left. Her hanging out with some old friends, including an ex boyfriend was the straw that broke the camel's back. Saying she felt more loved there then with me, I can’t prove it but I know she cheated on me as well. 

Moved to a small country town and am currently bunking with my folks for some cheap rent and emotional support, will move out again mid next year (2021) when my work on a side project is done. I’ve already lost 22kg, got heaps of work done on my side project, got a job and saved more money in 7 months then me and the ex did in 4 ½ years of marriage. 

As I stated above I’m pretty good socially, still need to lose more weight but I’ve come a long way and now only need 3XL shirts (down from 6 and 7XL, about 139kg right now, but will admit I don’t look half bad. So my weight will play some factor, maybe. But I’ve tried with girls around my size, bigger and smaller, different ages and much more. While I’ve made some nice friends out of this it seems like if I want to break my drought I will need to start seeing escorts again, which I don’t really want to do.

Now I do have one lone exception to this. About 3 months back I met a girl at one of these after parties I went to after meeting some (now) friends at a bar after I flew solo for the night (new to town). We made a date 2 weeks later and I had what I can only describe as the best night of my life as we went for 4 hours doing things I didn’t know were possible. She chased me and led most of the night, I felt so wanted and like a man for once. That was the only oasis in a desert that has been 19 months now, my ex withheld any sex for the last year of our marriage. Now this girl might be on the cards again later, not sure right now (seems this not sure things is a norm for most the girls I’ve got any future chance with, so over the endless limbo). And I’m talking to a few other ladies and seeing what happens. But for the life of me I can’t seem to get past 1 or 2 dates with any nice woman, or so much as secure a friends with benefits arrangement or something more casual with others. 

Now I’d like to point out I’m no creep. I want anything, be it a relationship or something not as serious to be with consent from both sides, and I at least like to meet a woman for coffee before doing anything with her, or maybe meet at the bar before :D. Some of you might say I’m trying too hard, but I’m letting a life long partner come naturally and I have no intention of rushing into any relationship before giving it time and using the knowledge I gained from all my past failures to make sure I do it right this time. But in the meantime it shouldn’t be impossible to have something more casual on the side should it? 

Please feel free to ask whatever questions you like. I’m really looking for some advice on this matter as I either can’t pin what is wrong with me, am I just so damn unlucky or whatever else might be going on. 

Update - I want to repost this with an update as I’ve figured out a lot and well this has led to more questions. 

So the weekend before Christmas I spent 4 nights in a major city in my country (Australia) and every night hit the town (was in town Thursday through to Monday). Again made friends, got to hang out with different groups but never got myself so much as a little fun for a night. I also met up with a girl from a dating app I’ve been happily talking to for 2 months, we both came to this city to meetup here, let’s just say that date failed big time. More on this later. Long story short I failed again to get myself any nice lady and well….. Paid an escort to get over my frustrations. 

For Christmas I joined the family in another capital city (I live in the middle of nowhere Australia), getting here was a plot out of a movie breaking down in the outback and just making it in before Christmas day. I’m typing this while still with the family, leaving back for home in a few days. Again I tried to find a friend with some benefits and so on, usual story no luck. One of these girls was an old friend who I thought I could get with as we both had a small thing for each other when I was married, but I’m a loyal soul, so nothing happened. Not married now, lol. We hung out for a day and got very flirty in a makeout session, sadly as I’m typing this I pretty much know that is all it’s going to be. Won’t say what is going on as that is personal for her, but it’s a life situation where it makes it nearly impossible for us to be together, I did try but. I feel really unlucky.

The first place award goes to another dating site girl I met. We got along great, later coming to discover we have a lot of similar likes, values and more. I really want to continue getting to know her and see if she has potential for a partner (no rushing into any relationship, no matter how good it looks). But she sat me down and told me no spark, not yet anyways. There is a chance in the future, but her life is in such chaos right now I think any guy would have got the same treatment. Now this is where I can be at fault for a few things, but without telling you this my main point won't make any sense. So we agreed to be just friends and proceeded to hang out for 3 days over New Years, both of us not having any plans. I bunked at her house while we spent time going out to see sites, watching lots of netflix, cooking and swimming together. Despite this the only thing I did with her was makeout (not much of this after the friends chat either), she is a damn fine kisser though. We also got really deep into conversation about each other’s lives and became quick and close friends. I only met her online dating about 3 days before all this went down, so really fast and close friends. 

Thanks to her I’ve come to realize that while not desperate in social situations, once I catch a scent of maybe getting any form of intimacy the desperation comes right out. I spent plenty of time those 3 days still hitting on her for some fun, just as friends of course. Here is the stupid thing, she is a sex fanatic, but she want’s to change that about herself, so I’m so stupid for still hitting on her hoping for maybe some casual sex as just friends or pity sex maybe….. Stupid I know. I know I need to focus on myself, getting another part time job to help with income, continue to lose more weight and finally get my side project done. But I really just want a relationship or at least a nice friend who comes with benefits. If you recall, lost virginity at 25/26 to hooker and since then only known, escorts or my lack of intimacy ex wife. I know It’s a bit silly to want this when focusing on healing myself (I thought I was over my ex, but not completely as it turns out) it is a better option. But with how unlucky/lack of experience or opportunity I’ve had in this area It’s not easy to just say “well I’ll be fine with nothing for 6 months while I get the rest of my life in order.”

With that lone exception 3 months back I now realise I did play it cool on that date, I at best expected a kiss at the end of the night but got a whole night of well, lets just say it’s a night I won’t forget. My point is no expectation, gave me no desperation. I know I’ve pretty much partly already answered my own question here, which I now realise (thanks new best friend). But what can I do about the fact that for the first time in my life I’ve got the chance to have some regular intercourse and find a new loving partner, but I just can’t seem to get lucky, or my desperation kills any chance. I almost feel like I won’t last 6 months, which I need to do for my long term life to get better, I mean losing more weight will greatly help my chances. 

I on one side of the coin feel stupid for letting wanting some fun consume my brain most of the time, but on the other side know intercourse is a natural and desirable part of human life. We all crave it and we all should get to experience it, why does it seem like I can’t then. I will say this but, in the situations my desperation has shown itself only once would it have made the difference in whether I got lucky or not. Most times it’s a stupid set of unlucky circumstances that my desperation only made come to the surface faster. 

I know the whole argument for just focus on yourself and life will come along and give me this on a silver platter, but I digress. It’s eating me alive inside and I’m at my wits end on how to handle this situation. I honestly feel having a semi regular partner for some fun would go a long way to letting my brain settle down as I got something to look forward to. Is my train of thought wrong? Am I just stupid? I just don't know where or what to do right now. Sorry for the long ramble, the only way I can really get it out there. Any advice would be great please. .",/r/dating_advice/comments/kpj5hn/need_some_general_advice_on_why_i_cant_get_myself/,5
85,kqk9yg,dating_advice,Tue Jan  5 00:56:57 2021,"(M30) Never really dated, moved out of parents home for independence/confidence/dating, but family will have to live with me due to issues, how hard will dating be?","Made a throwaway for this purpose since I'm kind of shy so best to keep it anonymous. I feel like my problem needs a bit of context, it isn't as simple as what I titled this post, so let me unload a little, I hope you don't mind  


Before the pandemic I moved out of my parents home. Had it all: high paying job, car, and finally my own place. That all changed when (wait for it) the pandemic struck.   


I am still employed, thankfully, but my parents' marriage didn't survive the pandemic and are getting divorced. My step father is kind of a prick, it came to light that apparently he was having an affair. This post isn't about that though, I couldn't care less about what happens to him.

So currently looking for a place for us to all move into.

""Us"" includes my mom and my siblings (one who is college-bound this year, and one who is mentally disabled).

Before I made the decision my mom kept telling me ""everything is going to be okay"", ""you're your own man now"", ""you don't need to worry about me"", but you know I had to analyze her situation carefully:

  
\- she had been unemployed for 10 years, she was a housewife and the man she married made her leave her job because he would ""take care of her"". I'm sitting here wondering how is she going to find a place. I needed references, job history, proof of income for a crappy apartment complex to even consider me, how is she going to pull it off while staying in SoCal (oh yea I live in SoCal btw, renting really sucks here)

\- she is responsible for my brother currently, how would she pull this off without any support from anyone

\- how is my sister going to focus on college if there are struggles at home. I want her to be able to find her independence and not have to depend on anyone to achieve her own happiness. (See the first bullet point)

So I weighed the options: I could be a selfish jerk and carry on with my life, or I could be there for my family because they need me. I decided to help them in the end. I love them after all. But the decision nearly drove me insane, and I think it partly has to do with my upbringing and past experiences. Let me explain.

Now for me I was always the ""nerd"" type, in the sense that I prioritized academia first over anything, a ""try-hard"" if you will, so I never really dated during my high school years. I went through a rough patch in my life post-high school, I guess you can say real life hit me like a truck, and so I didn't start college until later in life. Still not dating during these college years because I was thinking I wasn't good enough, stupid I know.   


After college I got a job, and part of that job requires me to travel to other states to visit satellite offices. During one of these trips I more or less had a fling I found on Tinder. This was in 2019. I was on Tinder for the same reasons other people are: hookups, sex, etc. Was never really into that sort of stuff during my late teens/early 20s, but then I started craving it. Probably that part of the brain that nags us to spread our genes. Always chickened out though, but I guess being in a strange place I figured ""I can be anybody I want here, nobody knows me"", so it was easier for me to go through with it.

From the perspective of someone who never really enjoyed life in their youth, the fling was loads of fun, but then it wasn't when it ended. This was my first and only fling, it had lasted maybe like 3 or 4 days I don't remember anymore.  


Anyway, I ended up feeling terrible. Its the sort of empty feeling you get when you're hungry, so you eat to fill the void, and then when you stop eating you realize it wasn't hunger that was giving you that empty feeling.  


As you can imagine it kind of fucked me up emotionally, especially since she never spoke to me again. I don't think I was mentally mature enough for this. But I think it also helped me grow up a bit from the perspective that there is more to life than just work. But I also realized that I didn't want just flings or sex, I wanted an emotional romantic connection with someone. Someone to enjoy life with, explore, see the world.

So I calculated, and executed soon after the following year: I moved out. I always wanted to be independent, but I also figure this was the best way to increase my chances at attracting potential dates. Its kind of weird, but I can sort of perceive that in American culture it is preferred to not live with your parents when you're seriously thinking about being serious with someone. Am I right about this? I feel like its an unspoken rule. My mom has always said its alright to live with your parents, but then again we are a Mexican-American family, she is from Mexico while I was born here, so I think she perceives it as okay for you to live with your parents until well into your 40s. She's old school like that.  


Well after that I moved out, got to enjoy independence for a few months, and almost got to go out on my first date, but then I didn't (found her on match, and no because pandemic). Life is beautifully disappointing and fulfilling like that I guess.  


So at the end of the day I'm stepping up to help my family out as they would do the same for me. It isn't a question of whether I should or not. In life you don't get to decide which cards you play with, you get dealt with what you're dealt, and you just have to play it out sometimes.

Nothing is forever, my mom will most likely retire after a few years, and while she may or may not need my financial help, she will be on her own somewhere.  


I do worry about the situation with my brother. Most likely he is someone who is going to be living with me from this point on. But I'm not worried about that part, I'm worried that I'll fall in love with someone, only for the whole thing to fall apart because they might want me to put my brother somewhere, or worst yet kick him out, but I know deep down in my heart I'll kick them out to the curb before I do that to my own brother. That probably will hurt I bet.

Now remember I have never dated so I am severely inexperienced. Yes I was an idiot for not having realized this before, but that's the beauty of youth, you get to do dumb shit. I don't think flings count as dating. Coupled with the fact that my mom and siblings will be living with me in the very near future. How would I approach dating in my unique situation? Is there even a chance?

Where would I even look? I don't have that many friends anymore, didn't have that many to start with, so romantic connections via mutual friendships is not really an option for me. I tried dating apps, and while it is fun, and easy for finding casual relationships, that sort of thing isn't for me.

 I want to emphasize, I do realize that relationships do not equal happiness. I am quite content with my life as it is now. But I feel like life will be more enjoyable if I shared it with someone who is just as happy, you know.

92,kqm9gd,dating_advice,Tue Jan  5 02:35:50 2021,"I (19F) , Worried about not finding a relationship, feeling unattractive and unlovable","&amp;#x200B;

A little information: (Just general stuff, take or leave,) I'm a 19 year old African-American girl, pansexual, and I am currently in college. Relatively tall, slight build, and short hair, if that helps at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Lately, more than I have in high school or my freshman year of college, I feel insanely unattractive and unlovable. I see so many people around me finding relationships (platonic, sexual, romantic, etc) and I feel very left out. I have tried so many times to doll myself up, be more friendly, be more approachable, and to no avail. Budding friendships die, anybody that I am attracted to seems to fade out of my life. 

I have dated before, but unfortunately, I found out after our breakup (we only dated for a month, which was about a year ago.) that he was just with me in hopes of fulfilling his Jezebel-stereotype of black women being freaks in the sheets. Since then, I have tried to convince myself that a relationship has no bearing on my self worth, but I still feel really depressed. Some of the men that I openly expressed interest in (I was varied in terms of forwardness, but I've never straight-up asked for a number or date) rejected me due to my race, my weight, my height, or said that my sexuality was off putting. I have tried to enter LGBTQ+ dating circles, or asked my other queer friends for help, but nothing really bears fruit. I often get over-dramatized responses to try and classify me (femme, butch, top, bottom, etc) which I am uncomfortable with.

My personality, as an introspective, is fair. I am witty and quick with a joke, but have never been close to the 'class clown' I am very 'chill', at times bubbly, but most often quiet. My friends often say that I have a nurturing, mom-like aura, while still being quite down to earth and honest. At times, I do have a temper, but I usually express any anger or strong negativity by taking a step back and self-isolating for a short time, rather than lashing out.  

As is the case with many women I've spoken to about this, I tend to blame my looks. I have a sharp jawline, broad shoulders, but I am not a pound over 116, which can come off a little tomboyish. I think that this contributes to a conflict with my 'soft' personality, perhaps people find that off putting? I struggle with body dysmorphia as a result of an eating disorder I struggled with for years, but with therapy, has been under control as of late. I have been told, and do believe, that I look slightly above average without makeup and quite pretty with makeup, which I have experimented with greatly. I can look polished, fresh, or fully done up, if need be. I have been told throughout my childhood that my slight frame and Carribean high cheekbones are modeling attributes, but I still feel quite inadequate as the men in my life have described me as androgynous or non-feminine. 

Whenever I attempt to be more girly, by adjusting my wardrobe or by slightly skewing my approach to people, I am met with surface level compliments that seem to bear no real influence (""oh my goodness, you look good in a dress!"" ""A skirt for once! Nice change!"" ""Oooh, she's *pretty!"" \*(said in a patronizing way, most of the time)\**)

I may come off as people pleasing in this post, but that is not really the case. I just describe the times I have tried to adjust myself, but these attempts are actually very sparse. I don't come from wealth, so I haven't really done any complete closet overhauls or expensive cosmetics. 

Anyhow, I am in **urgent need of advice** on how to go about dating and general platonic relationship building. I do have a small circle of friends, who I love dearly as if they were family, but they go to different colleges and we rarely get together. I don't think it wrong or self-serving to want to develop new friendships and meet new people.  However, every time I try, I find myself reaching out to an indifferent individual, or alone in my apartment, with nobody to talk to (even virtually, considering the current pandemic). 

***What am I doing wrong?*** **Please give any advice you think would help, and I am totally able to answer questions, or provide a picture if this post gains traction. Thank you very much. &lt;3**",/r/dating_advice/comments/kqm9gd/i_19f_worried_about_not_finding_a_relationship/,34

91,krjvla,dating_advice,Wed Jan  6 10:33:24 2021,What just happened?!,"Hey guys,

I (34F) met a gorgeous man (34M) through Tinder who I clicked with instantly. We are both travelling on the road at the moment (van life) and we spent a week together in a row, just the two of us (24 hours a day).

We ended up hooking up the first night and the morning after, and he was tender and very sensual. The sex was intensely good for both of us (we both said so).

He told me that he liked me and how much he loved my ""vibe"".

I left the second day and he contacted me later asking if we could meet up and spend new years eve together. I said yes, and he then decided to follow me on my trip.

Weird thing was that after the initial two hookups, he would cuddle me throughout the night (both being naked) but nothing further would happen, and during the day he would hug me here and there or touch my face, but nothing much. 

We've had really deep talks and shared openly about our lives. We've spent all our time together just chilling, star gazing, swimming, yoga, cooking, or having long conversations. He'd ask me lots and lots of questions about myself and share as well. Then he'd invite me to stay in his van each night. We have so much in common and the exact same perspectives on life and society etc.

I told him that I was finding it hard to read him and to understand what he wants or what was going on. He then dropped the ""I'm not vibing more than friends"" and that he rarely sleeps with anyone and normally it takes him months of building feelings, and that whilst the sex was really good, he didn't want it to happen again. I asked if something had happened and he just said he ""decided"" he didn't want to.

He also said he doesn't know if he wants to stay in Australia (and was talking about going back to Mexico constantly when we were together).

I felt like he's led me on big time by telling me he likes me, following me around, inviting me over every night and spooning me all night etc...I don't understand it. 

I left the next morning and he asked for two hugs and told me he'd be ""open to"" keeping in touch. 

Not his fault that the feelings aren't there for him but am I crazy to have assumed there was something there by the way he was acting with me?

58,kuwtnp,dating_advice,Mon Jan 11 08:13:36 2021,I'm (31/M) having a hard time building an emotional connection with dates?,"I am a 31 year old male in a major North American city. Good job, money, have plenty of interesting hobbies (salsa dancing, muay thai, yoga, weightlifting, hunting), well traveled, and consistent with reading, listening to podcasts, and always educating myself. 

In my early 20's I realized that you could just cold approach women which gave me the confidence to just talk to anyone which then furthered my confidence in my personal life and career. I started to date like crazy, slept around a lot, and even fell in love several times with amazing girls.

I am now 31 and recently Ive noticed that whenever I go on first dates, I often receive a ""Sorry I just dont feel an emotional connection"" text after or when I ask for a second. Now on the dates Im smiling, cracking jokes, being flirty, pyhsically escalate and avoid any negative topics. In recent years my hair has begun to recede and my looks have definitely changed. Though I definitely think this is a factor I dont think its mainly that because Im clearly getting initial dates with girls. In the Summer of 2020 I must of been on 15 dates and only 1 led to sex.  In October I started seeing a girl for 2 months and before Christmas she called me up and said ""I think we should stop seeing each other. I just dont feel an emotional connection."" Honestly, I was pretty relieved.

In 2019 a relationship of 1.5 years did end due to long distance with a girl I was crazy about. When that ended I started to feel cynical towards relationships as I felt ""Whats the point? It can just end"". Maybe this vibe Im still projecting. Any advice would be appreciated?",/r/dating_advice/comments/kuwtnp/im_31m_having_a_hard_time_building_an_emotional/,21
72,kv34t8,dating_advice,Mon Jan 11 15:58:34 2021,confused on who to choose,"Hi! This is my first post but I'm having trouble I need to make a choice on who to give a chance too but I am really not sure and i just really need to rant but feel free to give me suggestions.

so first off theres my ex who I still love but im not sure I should give another chance too. we are eachothers first loves first person we ever had sex with (both of us) but we broke up dec 2019 because he wanted to ""explore the world"" (be a hoe). throught 2020 tho he got with another girl, he kept coming back to me saying ""i am the only one for him"". he broke up with her and found some other people who are new. he came back to me again about saying how he loves me and wished he never broke it off and all that other stuff, he told me all the people he messed with and I didnt say anything even though it hurt cause we weren't together. plus he was actually serious about getting back together with me but I had had sex with. I knew this guy before through my ex i didnt think they were actually close he had alot of friends that were older than us and I always had a bit of a crush. when  i told him this he exploded and acted like i killed his dogbecause ""thats his friend i slept with"" but we weren't together why is that such a big deal!!!! so we ended up stop  talking once again hes still talking to other people but hes back at me again. this time he told me he slept with my ex best friend (we stopped talking cause i was sure she liked him my boyfriend at the time) and that hurt alot. he even said he did it because an eye for an eye, since i slept with his friend he did it cause he knew it would hurt me like it hurt him. BTW WE LIVE IN A SUPER SMALL COUNTRY WHERE EVERYONE KNOWS EVERYONE. also my ex has changed into this narcissistic fuck boy. we still get on super well and are very comfortable around eachother but i dont like it.

what my ex doesnt know is i slept with his other friend the one he looks up to as a mentor before he even told me about his revenge. i didnt plan for that to happen we were genuinely just friends, hes a bit older than i am but is a super nice guy and it just kinda happend. we talk every night hes really sweet to me and my friends are convinced he really likes me but I just dont think it can work. If my ex were to find out he'd hate the both of us, as i said before everyone knows everyone and i am actually friends with mentor's ex gf who still has feelings for him and i dont want to be labled as a bad person with these people. he's a really respectable guy and i dont want to put him in this situation either. plus i am not even attracted to him. i dont really like his face he has a bird chest and has super bad allergies I am really just attracted to his personality. plus i doubt he would want something serious from me so i stopped sleeping with him i am honestly dodging him at this point but he is also the best candidate right now. also i hate kissing him lol.

okay finally theres this new guy who i've had a crush on for so long. literally so cute but he is a local youtuber everyone knows him which is kinda iffy (cos everyone knows everyone). hes never been in a comitted relationship before red flag, hes a known fuck boy and he has rape allegations. sigh. it is like he is finally oticing and wants to take me out on a date but i am not sure if i wanna go. plus we have barely texted because he is so busy and texts dry do i dont really enjoy texting him back. hes a hype boy out here, very popular with what we call the ""uptowns"" loaded with money and all of that so i am kinda iffy with this. plus he goes to college in america! I said no new bodies for 2021 and i think thats all he wants idk maybe my great personality will change his mind but boys will be boys. i am clearly attracted to toxicity wow. do i take the leap of faith and go out with him or just ignore it? also all of these ppl know eachother, perks of living on a small island -\_-. 

so yeah thats basically it do i try my ex again? his friend? or the youtuber? wow this is really sad.",/r/dating_advice/comments/kv34t8/confused_on_who_to_choose/,4
73,kv351n,dating_advice,Mon Jan 11 15:59:00 2021,Need advice - 24/F went on first date in 3 years on Saturday night,"Hi, I just downloaded Hinge around Thanksgiving and my first match was with this incredible attractive dude. He is the most attractive man I've ever seen in my entire life, we had a couple mutual friends who I asked about him and they all said he's very sweet/nice. Not to be vain but people say I'm very attractive as well. We ended up switching to talking via text and texted every single day for basically 2 months. Huge paragraphs, updates, everything. We couldn't see each other because of the holidays/covid/seeing parents so we kept texting until he officially came back to NYC (he was at home with his fam this whole time). 

Saturday night we finally met for drinks. It was so awkward, at least in the beginning, after a couple drinks convo was much better but I was feeling very drunk but not blackout. We had a heavy makeout session on the street and I decided to go back to his apartment, which I deeply, deeply regret. This is where it's fuzzy and I'm just so frustrated with myself. We ended up having sex, which was fine except I forgot I'm on my period. So there's that. Also I still felt so awkward at times even when we were talking after, I felt like I made a huge mistake. Jumped the gun so fast because it felt like I knew him so well at that point from all the talking we did beforehand. I was so embarrassed about the sex and he seemed thrown off too. I ended up sleeping over then Sunday morning we made out a bit and I did the walk of shame back home. 

It just doesn't feel right anymore, no communication from him all day until last night  and it was about something very basic. I feel like it's over. I'm just so ashamed of myself and grossed out that I did that, i wish I could go back and gone home after the street makeout. I haven't had sex in 3 years and this was the first guy who I felt so so attracted to but it feels like I was more attracted to him that he was to me. Do you think it's over? I noticed he had a small update to his Hinge profile so I'm assuming it's over. I don't really know how to move on since we talked every day for a couple months. I'm 25/F he's 26/M. No guy interests me either when Im on hinge all I can think about is this dude.",/r/dating_advice/comments/kv351n/need_advice_24f_went_on_first_date_in_3_years_on/,16
17,kvkes6,dating_advice,Tue Jan 12 06:33:11 2021,Is what I'm looking for in a partner unreasonable?,"I've been reading a bunch of relationship advice for women, and have started to think that maybe what I'm looking for in a partner is toxic, but I'm not sure.  Please let me know!

I'll preface this by saying that if 999/1000 women would be unhappy and unfulfilled in a relationship with me, I view that as 'not unreasonable' standards, because I only need to find that one girl, that one time.

What I offer: I work a low-stress job and can easily cover groceries for two + all my bills with some leftover for savings.  I'd like to think that I'm decently attractive ('hwp', 'tall', etc), and that I'm not selfish in bed (sex should be satisfying for everyone, and while it can be fun to treat it like sport and do all sorts of kinky stuff, sometimes it's nice to just hug someone).  I hired a maid to handle chores once a week (clean, laundry, etc).  My house isn't the nicest but it's big enough and nothing is broken, I don't drink or do drugs (not even weed, I'm not morally opposed to substance use, but it isn't a part of my life and I don't want it to be), and I don't have (or want) any expensive hobbies (I like reading books, listening to music, sometimes watching movies/anime, working out sometimes in my home gym, and playing indie games, I feel rich when I buy a bunch of $5 games during a Steam sale).  Sometimes I'll rant about whatever weird stuff I'm reading to whoever is in earshot, and I've tried a few weird diets (keto!  bodybuilder IIFYM!  carnivore!  never vegan tho, yikes).  Not planning to have kids, kind of fucks up the finances.  Also not a fan of pets (travel is hard enough).  I don't have any mental health issues that require treatment or drugs, but I think I'm about as weird and crazy as anyone else.

What I want: I don't like doing chores at all (laundry, taking out trash, cleaning, etc), I like eating food but not cooking it, I like having a clean house but not cleaning, and I like having a pretty girl around to hug and talk to and stuff.  I don't think my standards for pretty are too crazy. If (pre-covid) I walked around any major American city for a day, I definitely saw 'a lot' of women who make me think 'wow she's cute!'; I think that as long as someone takes care of themselves (healthy food, enough exercise) and wants to be pretty, they usually can be.

So an ideal relationship for me would be with an attractive (to me!) woman who has a home-based profession that isn't too stressful (so she has some disposable income for herself and doesn't feel dependent on me, but has plenty of time for 'us' rather than some manager), healthy relationships with family/friends (I'm a homebody and really hate the idea of someone being totally emotionally dependent on me, people who try to emotionally isolate people are weird and a little scary), who likes managing a household (I don't actually care who does chores, as long as it isn't me)/cooking for two, is kind of a homebody, doesn't care too much about signifiers of social status (owning brands, going out so people can see you wearing brands...there's nothing wrong with spending all your time around the house in PJs!), doesn't have any serious mental health or substance abuse challenges, and likes physical affection.  I think FDS would derisively call a woman who agrees to this a 'bangmaid' (yikes).  

I don't think I'm looking for the impossible or being selfish, but I'm open to being wrong on both counts.  What about cultures other than USAmerican?  If you're a female and are creeped out/really hate this, please let me know why!",/r/dating_advice/comments/kvkes6/is_what_im_looking_for_in_a_partner_unreasonable/,12
39,kvygty,dating_advice,Tue Jan 12 21:17:12 2021,Sex with tinder match,"I’m (23M ) black guy from the Midlands, recently I have matched with this white girl on Tinder, didn’t think too much of it, but her on the other hand different story.

I’m one of the lucky few people, not to have been affected by lockdown, career wise. I have a steady income working in a place I like, while 
I also have a side job in the sports industry, I hope to eventually progress with my side job, and make it my main source of income, hopefully working abroad such as America or Canada.

However, due to this lockdown and being single, I haven’t had much fun in the bedroom department recently, When it comes to one night stands I don’t believe guys should be pick, better have sex with a girl you don’t find attractive then lust after the girl of your dreams for years only for her to end up with someone else. 

I recently matched with this girl on Pinder, let’s call her Emma. We have been messaging each other,  things were cool at first, but then she started obsessing with the fact that I’m black which started creeping me out, she kept telling me how she liked black guys. 

 I asked her what her favourite TV show was, she told me she liked power, because “it’s full of black people“ like wtf kinda of reason is that to watch a show. Nothing about the story or the drama  of the show, just the ethnicity of its actors. 

At one point she told me she had a one night stand with a black guy, and she got pregnant from it,I’m not sure I really believe her but whatever. However what she said next was what made me decided I wanted to cut her off, she said she was so happy she was pregnant because she always wanted a mixed child, she didn’t even know much about the father, she was just happy at the fact she had gotten pregnant by a black man, if her being pregnant is even true, so take it with a pinch of salt. 
 
We arranged for her to spend a couple of nights at mine, here is the problem, I don’t know if I should just have sex with her and then break things off with her, or maybe just tell her we’re better off as friends(I don’t want her as a friend, just being nice). Then again like I said before, it’s been a couple of months since I’ve had some fun lol.

Any suggestions on how I should handle this.",/r/dating_advice/comments/kvygty/sex_with_tinder_match/,57
63,kxf1zy,dating_advice,Thu Jan 14 23:19:32 2021,Is he a normal American guy or a psycho?,"After the break up the first guy that I liked seems to be strange. 

He's from the US and he's working in one of our branches. I was introduced to him when with some colleagues we went on a business trip. And from the first day, after the drinks,z he started hitting on me. 

Nothing happened during the first trip, as when he was hugging me, I just left him there saying goodbye. But he showed some tiny attention, like when he was smoking outside and I joined him, he lit a cigarette, though he never smokes more than one. Or he found out my eating habits, though I never told him. Or when I wrote in our group chat that I'm going upstairs he joined me after 2 minutes. 

But when we are alone together he acts like he doesn't care about me, he doesn't talk to me, etc. When we returned to the city he told me where I can find him, I went there with friends and we met, and we started discussing some topics and my friends left us alone in the bar. After some time he started to hug me and after a couple of minutes, he just left. 

And recently I was invited to a friend's party. And he wrote to me that he wants to come. My friend invited him. At first, he entered and didn't pay that much attention, but after some time he started hugging me, telling me some sweet nothings, and kissing in front of my friends. So we left the party together, though he didn't say bye to anyone and was waiting for me outside of the club. 

Sex was good, though it was so odd because he skipped the foreplay. And that was so odd to me. Btw I enjoyed it when he started hugging me at the club, but when he started kissing me I felt nothing. 

We had another business trip - now we were alone with the driver. He sat in the front seat, leaving me in the back alone. And then he didn't say anything, I was talking with the driver, while he was checking his email, Facebook, dating apps, etc. I think he wanted me to see that he's using dating apps, but I already knew that. So we returned from the trip and we barely talked for 15 mins. When we were back the driver and I was discussing how hungry are we and where and what we want to eat. After some time he stopped the car, said he's hungry, and went to a restaurant. And 50+ driver and I had dinner without him.

I just can't understand what is going on with him. Is he nuts? I know he has anxiety, is his behavior has anything to do with it? He shows attention and talks to me actively only when he's drunk. Does it mean he has just a lack of experience or he's just drunk, and everyone is gorgeous when he's drunk?

I really can't understand and don't know how to react. Is he a normal American guy or a psycho? What should I do?",/r/dating_advice/comments/kxf1zy/is_he_a_normal_american_guy_or_a_psycho/,20

I always have this feeling wondering if he’s just keeping me around to keep him entertained during this pandemic. He said he doesn’t really go anywhere and sometimes sees his friends and sister when he can.

At first, we had gone on three dates by December, and it was going okay until like the holidays came around, and the texting died down so fast. We were still in touch but the texting was very short. We only communicated casually through one or two snapchat, and then some memes here or there on Instagram. 

Then after the holidays were over, I had asked if I could go see him for a dick appointment. (I felt like it wasn’t going the way I had originally wanted so I asked that). Yes, he did wait like two months for me to initiate the whole sex thing. He told me he’s more of a traditional guy (pays for every single date). 

I had mentioned of being FWB (right around the time I had I wanted to come over to have sex) but he was making a joke that we aren’t FWB yet and he joked about trying again, like a second chance? Also I had joked that he should earn it to have sex with me (I just wanted to find a way that he would do something to make the situation playful and less awkward).

When we were together, we were listening to music, dancing, talking, etc). I even slept over because he wanted me to, we had breakfast the next morning and we cuddled. We’re going on another date again this weekend.

We’re a little over two months now. But at one point I was unsure if that was going to last when it was the holidays (but that could be also he was a little sad about the holidays and it not being the same bc it’s a pandemic which I totally got, so I gave him space)

I had also mentioned that my love language was acts of service, and he said that it goes a long way with him. He also was there for me when I was really stressed out and he even asked me the next night if my day was better then before. So sweet! We’re doing better now then we were weeeks ago and he’s probably going to help me move to my new apartment in the city and my friends say that that’s not FWB thing, that it’s technically a bf thing. 

guess me writing this makes me realize he probably does like me way more then I thought. LOL. We aren’t around other people because it’s a pandemic, but like before it got really cold, we went on some dinner dates, bowling and we even stayed in at his apartment twice. This weekend we’re going to a museum. 

I’m new to this whole dating in nyc thing. I went on like two dates since being back home during this pandemic and then one was solely a one night stand. I just have this thought like what would happen to us if the pandemic just magically never happened? I guess we’ll find out if we’re still talking in a few months time LOL. He’s always telling me how this pandemic can be hard on him at times but I guess that didn’t stop him from totally not talking to me. 

My friends say he might be in it for the long haul, because at first I was talking to other guys, and he DID know that. Idk how he feels about it because he’s never asked. But he never really talked about other girls (he said he doesn’t even use the apps, and said he hasn’t really used hinge anymore).",/r/dating_advice/comments/kxxw8v/does_he_like_me/,8

I grew up in a really conservative religion. And my two narcissisist parents figured out that dropping us off at the place of worship for activities and leaving us there for hours is a great way to get free babysitting services and spend less time with their kids. Anyway, it distorted my whole world view because of the crazy ass gender norms. Men were expected to pretend that women didn't exist, not look at women, random guys would direct me to enter in through another door. Alot of bs and hypocracy because I'm sure they were watching porn at home...but I digress. I grew up having no clue how attractive I was. Not just physically but my personality and my spirit. I realize now it was a combo of the narc parents in addition to having to spend so much time in a toxic religious and cultural community and also the constant barrage of racism and negativity of being a vilified minority in America has really distorted how I view myself.

I had a really good FWB friendship with different types of women from different backgrounds. And I realise even when we are vibing during sex and can have good conversations, it never moves on because one party thinks the other is not good enough. 

There's this woman that I met in Sydney and we were vibing so well in bed. But we are did not move to the relationship status because she... was not good enough.

Coincidences. 

So fast forward. He has a dream to be navy seal in Brazil. He has a contract for 3.5 more years in the navy, or he has to pay to break it. He always intended before he met me to do the navy seal course, it’s his dream literally. The man spends his free time watching YouTube videos about it. So anyway, we always have unprotected sex. We never had any close calls, although we deserved it admittedly. Well now I’m pregnant. 

He will starts his course when I’m 3 months pregnant. This course involves him being gone for weeks at a time, without his phone. He won’t even be talking to me. He offers to give up, he offered to give up before I was even pregnant just to be with me. I just don’t have it in my heart to say yes, again... it’s his dream. So basically he will go through the course, I will have the baby 3 months before he finishes. I told him he needs to be here by the time the baby is 6 months old. I’m a first time mum and I’m scared. I need him. I don’t want to do it alone. But then I’m like.. why do I need to do anything alone if he’s literally only gonna be a navy seal for 3 months, why doesn’t he just come now?

Opinions please!

Side note: moving to Brazil isn’t an option. I’ve been there enough times to know it’s not an option. Also, he would never be home anyway, so what’s the point? And if I leave now, I would have to come back and try to find a job after many years of not working while I have a toddler! It’s not realistic. I can’t do that with faith. Not to mention Brazil is dangerous, I can’t speak the language, I have no friends there, my partner would be gone (like literally gone!), I have no family there... how selfish am I to say he needs to come before the baby is born? He would have to give up his dream he’s worked toward for 8 years!",/r/dating_advice/comments/l3hw7w/distance_the_dreaded_distance/,2
80,l3iz8w,dating_advice,Sat Jan 23 21:48:26 2021,Trying to Navigate Jealousy/Envy in a Newly Poly Relationship,"Me (26f) and my boyfriend (29m) have been dating for almost 3 years, and living together for 2. Throughout our whole relationship we've talked about opening our relationship and the idea that one soulmate for life isn't something we saw for ourselves individually. One of the main reasons is that I am bisexual, but have never explored with dating women and the other major reason is that my partner and I's sexual chemistry has been a little lacking, and that's something that's important to him.

About a year ago we started talking seriously about opening our relationship so that I could date women, and he would be able to fulfill his sexual needs. Then 2020 happened and we put the conversation on hold and in the meantime talked about the future and strengthened our bond. A few weeks ago we decided we wanted to take baby steps into this world, I would start talking to women on dating apps and he would start to flirt with people he meets through streaming on twitch.

About a week later, he sat me down and told me that he had started talking to someone and he could already tell he had strong feelings for her and told me and wanted to pursue a relationship with her. He told me right away, and I was a little shocked because it happened so fast and was way different what we had discussed.

We've both agreed that our relationship is very important and special to us and while this is a hard adjustment, I want to give it a real shot to see if it could work and not make any major decisions while figuring things out. But I'm having anxiety/jealousy/envy and since we're new to all of this, I'm not sure which areas are ones to address with him, and which might be overreactions to having an emotional week.

* The first is that she is only 23 and he is 29. Age is not something I normally have an issue with, but she's still in college and lives with her parents, and he's about to enter his 30's. He's a very ""young"" 29, but nonetheless they're at totally different stages of life. She also lives in Texas, and we live in NYC. They had discussing meeting in Texas, and we talked about it and figured it would be better for him to go sooner rather than later so we know how to move forward, but the idea of traveling right now makes me a little nervous.
* My boyfriend was laid off from his job in the video game industry due to COVID, and ever since has been streaming on Twitch and slowly developing a committed following. They met through Twitch (she's also a streamer) so they spend almost all day every day either playing games together, popping in each others streams, or playing with their friends often until 3-4 in the morning. She offered to pay for him to go to Texas, stay in a hotel while there, and has donated over $300 to his stream since as well, which is a lot of money to drop after knowing someone for a couple weeks.
* We've talked at length about making sure to make more time for us to spend together and whenever I feel anxious or want to talk things through he's been open and receptive to what I have to say. I also found some great articles that I wanted him to read so we could discuss it together, but he doesn't retain information well from reading so would rather me prompt a discussion from that material.

I really want for this to work; she makes him really happy, they have lots in common, and she gives him what I can't. I know in my head that this could be really good for us, but I struggle with knowing they spend all day and night talking, playing and laughing, while we spend our time together looking over articles and over-communicating our feelings and checking in with each other emotionally. I feel like I'm the ""strict"" parent who makes you eat cheerios because they're good for you and she's the ""fun"" parent who lets you eat candy for breakfast.

TLDR: My boyfriend has major NRE and I'm trying to find the best way to communicate my concerns/feelings in a constructive way.",/r/dating_advice/comments/l3iz8w/trying_to_navigate_jealousyenvy_in_a_newly_poly/,8
1,la8k09,dating_advice,Mon Feb  1 19:23:09 2021,Was I a bad boyfriend or was she manipulative? How can I avoid the same mistake?,"So today facebook suggested my ex gf as a friend. No, I didnt send her a friend request but it got me thinking. Was I a bad boyfriend? 

Long story short, I had pretty horrible anxiety and self esteem issues growing up (I'm not american and my country sucks) so I didnt have my first gf until I was 24. 

She was my first gf (20) so I was incredibly apprehensive about sex (intimacy issues + body dysmorphia). However,  she said that it was ok and that she was willing to wait.  She even asked to be my gf like 5 dates in. In fact, when I mentioned to her that I once hurt my back in a motorcycle accident she said that I could be in a wheelchair and she would still date me...

Anyway, one day she was practically throwing herself at me so I felt pressured to have sex and so we did. I couldn't get hard because I was really nervous. Plus, she made a huge deal about me not being circumcised. ""Please tell me that if we ever get married you'll get it removed"" she said. She finished. I didnt.

She then became distant and stopped answering my calls. I contacted her best friend and she told me my gf she seeing other guys and that she complained to her that I was really insecure and that she needed a man who could take care of things. Her friend also told me that she said I was probably an illegal immigrant...Then when I confronted her about it she said that I was a horrible kisser, that I was boring, and a horrible texter. As someone who had just gotten over anxiety and recently started being social and making friends this crushed me.

I did go to therapy, started going to the gym and even finished my masters degree...however I never dated again. I'm 27 now and ready to start. Any advice?",/r/dating_advice/comments/la8k09/was_i_a_bad_boyfriend_or_was_she_manipulative_how/,20

His whole body count  is a list of Asian countries including the one my relatives emigrated  from.  

He also seems to think he ""understands me"" because he has been  emotionally connected to Asians. (I'm as American as he is.) Am I an ass  for being disappointed with our relationship?  I don't want to be his  fetish object, and it bothers me that he thinks I'm some exotic  ""foreigner"".

54,lflsro,dating_advice,Mon Feb  8 23:03:55 2021,Is this weird behavior for dating apps?,"Hi y’all. I’m cross-posting here (also posted in r/Relationships) bc I’m pretty confused on how to proceed with a casual fling from a dating app. I’m 22, he’s 25, and we have been hanging out for about a month now, once or twice a week. It’s been mostly sexual, with the occasional movie/meal pretense. We did paint together the second time we hung out, but I would say I see him mostly as a casual sex partner. In general, it is helpful for me to keep clear boundaries with casual partners; ie, no sleepovers, no long cuddles, etc. With this person, I have spent the night twice, mostly because I was too tired to drive home, but the experience has felt surprisingly intimate. We have great sexual chemistry and get along well, but I have felt at times like we’re pretending to be in a relationship and then going our separate ways until we get together to do it all again. He does text me once or twice a day, either a song or a random thing that made him think of me, a meme etc and I respond with the same energy. As we’ve continued hanging out, I’ve gotten more comfortable with him and we have talked about doing other things together. He’s planning on helping me fix my car door this week, we’ve talked about playing tennis, etc. He even suggested I come with him for a weekend trip sometime. All things that would indicate an interest in more than just physical intimacy! 

What is really strange to me is his presence on dating apps since we’ve met! I noticed about two weeks in that he had unmatched me on Bumble because I couldn’t find his profile and then he came back up in my feed. I can’t really think of a good reason why he’d do that, other than not wanting me to be able to see when he edits his profile. I didn’t think too much of it, though. I was still swiping on people, etc, as well — we have both established that we’re only looking for something casual. 

Last night, I was swiping and he popped up under a different name. Similar profile, used many of the same photos, account verified, had a flag that said ‘’new here’. It was clearly him. A few minutes later, I found his brother’s profile, also under a different name. The fake names were Dave and David. I texted him and asked him about the two profiles. He told me it was because Americans can’t pronounce his and his brothers names. He’s from the Middle East and his name is uncommon, so the logic tracks. I guess I’m just wondering why he’s making a *new* account under lowkey misleading pretenses to continue matching people. I swiped on him, he’d swiped back. It’s not even a conversation about exclusivity, because I am also on apps still. Although, I tend to only want one sex partner at a time so it’s more for dopamine/the potential of actually seeking out someone for a romantic connection, if that makes sense. Basically, I like to keep my sexual partners as just that, and have a different mentality with courtship for someone I want to get to know romantically. This has gotten a little messy though, and I’m wondering if anyone else thinks it’s weird or has any input. Since I brought it up today, his attitude has been kind of strange. More enthusiastic to hang out/ do something non-sexual. Maybe he’s worried I’ll ghost him because I know he’s seeking other sex partners? 

Should I tell him I’m not asking for exclusivity, but I want to set boundaries that we should keep things physical? Should I ask if he’s sleeping with anyone else? I haven’t been with anyone since we met, even though I’m still active on Bumble. Also, I could just be overthinking. Just seems strange, given that he unmatched me before and now has an entirely new profile. Almost seems like he’s trying to pull a fast one, but I’m not sure what to think! Do y’all find it weird that he unmatched me and then made an entirely new profile under a different name? 


TLDR: met a guy on Bumble, have been hooking up and hanging out for a month, both said we didn’t want anything more than casual sex but have been engaging in emotional intimacy, found a new profile yesterday that was verified w his pictures under a different name.

THE BLACK GIRLS.  OMG.  I find black girls extremely beautiful.  I am Italian and consequently I live in Italy and here there are not many black girls and those who are obviously tend to stay among them also because, in Italy, people's mentality is still very closed.  so i could never interact with a real black girl.  as far as I can see on social media, following black American and non-American girls, my taste for them only intensifies.  I love the way they move, talk, gesticulate and frankly, they're a lot sexier than white girls, in my opinion.  here in Italy I have never been able to have a conversation on this subject because all my friends like girls with typical European tastes, thin blond girls and blue eyes.  not me.  i much prefer thick black girls.  from what transpires I like the fact that they also seem much more exhibitionist, in the good sense of the term, I don't know how to say it in English, in the sense, they are not afraid to show their way of being sexy, precisely dancing in a very sensual way  practicing twerk.  For me this font is very interesting because I am a very open minded type and ready for any experience.  I would really like to be able to talk to an American girl, because I repeat, from what transpires on social media they seem exactly as I described them.  any of you (white with me) have had experience with girls like this?  if so, how was it?  some black girl wants to have a chat with an Italian?  lol I hope this post doesn't pass as a racist because I still can't speak English well, in case I'll be ready to clear up any kind of misunderstanding.

I'm a slave little Primal pet I just want to be in a relationship first I want to give my everything to one person. granted when I came out a lot less people talk to me in general it was still always white people it's gotten to the point where there's a black dude in my DM I literally breaks my neck to talk to him.

Every other race is allowed to date their own race but when I do it I constantly get give a white guy a chance I shouldn't have to feel like I'm being societally pressured to date someone just because they want to date me.

I haven’t really met anyone, haven’t spoken to anyone either, no kisses or sex obviously, and as stated, no dates. Recently downloaded tinder again, quickly matched with a relatively cute girl and just last night she asked me if I want to meet up with her. Now, I haven’t gotten back since the message was sent so early in the morning (honestly never respond to anything sent before at least 8 AM so I don’t look like a weirdo), but I know my answer will be yes. She lives pretty close, just about in my neighborhood, so I’ll probably ask if she wants to walk around the local park. Now my real problem is, I don’t live alone, I live with my mother; now, I ain’t worried she’ll think I’m a loser or anything (I can easily spin it to say I lost my job and home due to the pandemic, which is at least half-way true) I *am* worried however about kissing or getting more intimate with this girl. Honestly I’m confident enough in my ability to carry a date and flirt that I know I can at least get a kiss on this date, it’s just, my mother is *so* paranoid about the pandemic, she is constantly terrified of me catching it and passing it to her so I’m pretty hamstrung; like physical intimacy is more or less out of the question until I get vaccinated or something, hell if I even kissed a woman my mother would blow a gasket (which is fucking awful considering I’m a grown ass man, I truly hate how my life has been reverted to that of a *12 year old’s*).

I will admit however, my mother’s paranoia has passed onto me, I’m also worried that if I kiss this girl I really might get sick; thing is however I just...I don’t want to pass this up? I’m actually pretty damn lonely at this point and furthermore am at an age when I want a real relationship instead of just hookups and flings; this girl is the same age as I am (23) which I’m thankful for as there’s more of a chance for a real relationship with a girl my age or slightly older.

88,lr84qq,dating_advice,Wed Feb 24 10:58:15 2021,Am I going crazy or does he still have feelings for me?," 

Hi guys,

about     one year ago my ex (30m) broke up with me (29f). We were about to   move   from Australia to Germany together (we're both German and met in     Australia). About 8 months before the breakup, he became more and  more    depressed and eventually broke up, doubting his feelings for me.  I  know   he had been in a bad place for a long time, but I didn't  believe  for a   second that he never loved me. I know he did. We never  had any  issues   between us. He's an amazing person and I always felt  like he  was the lid   to my pot ;-)

After   the breakup,   we both moved back to Germany (600km away from each   other). In the  first  2 months after the breakup I went NC to get some   distance. Then  we  started talking every now and then. Since then, he   has visited me  three  times despite having to drive 12 hours (return!)   to see me. The  distance  made it impossible to reconcile, but I also   think he wasn't   ready/didn't want to back then.

After     I got back to Germany I was unemployed. I looked for jobs all across     Germany and our neighbouring countries, but struggled to find   something   due to Covid. Then I was offered my dream job. I applied in a   different   city but they ended up offering me the position in a city   40km away  from  my ex. Considering I was willing to move anywhere and   it's an  amazing  opportunity, I took the job. My ex was excited.

The     last time he visited me was in the beginning of January. We had a  few    amazing days together, he was loving, affectionate, etc. Then I     distanced myself again, as I had a lot to organise. This past weekend I     spent at his place though, as I was sorting out a new apartment in  the    new city. Again, we had the most amazing weekend together. In    comparison  to 6, 7, 8 months ago, he's a different person now. He's    really been  working on himself. The whole situation felt like when we    first met and  fell in love.

He    was extremely  affectionate, tldr couldn't keep his hands of me. He  just   kept bear-hugging  me all weekend, stroking my hair until I fell    asleep, holding my hands,  lots of long soft kisses etc. Whenever he    walked past me in his  apartment, he would give me a kiss or hug or  just   held me. The chemistry  was still there, we got along so well and    laughed a lot (but that was  never the issue between us). When he  went   to work in the morning  yesterday, he woke me briefly, cuddled me  for a   few minutes and told me  again he was excited for me to move  there in   only one week. Then he left  for work. I slept for another 2  hours, then   woke up. I was planning on  leaving then as I had a 6 hour  drive ahead   of me, but he called, asking  if I was still at his  apartment. One of   his clients had canceled an  appointment and he  asked me to wait so he   could come back and have a  coffee with me  before I leave. Kinda felt   like he didn't want me to go.  So again, he  spent 30 minutes kissing and   hugging me, before he had to  go back to  work.

The   last time we  talked  about our relationship was 6 months ago. Back  then  he was still   sorting himself out and didn't want to try again.   Obviously, the   distance was a factor, too. We didn't think we would   ever end up in  the  same city again. Well, fate decided differently. So   much has  changed  since we had that conversation 6 months ago. It feels   so much  different  between us.

So    here's my question:  Is it possible he still (or again?) has feelings    for me? It does feel  like it. What man would do a 12 hour return trip 3    times for an ex  girlfriend? And he does have options in his city if   it  was just about  sex. But that's what I'm worried about: Maybe he's   just  lonely and  things with me are familiar? Would you guys say it's    possible he still  has feelings?",/r/dating_advice/comments/lr84qq/am_i_going_crazy_or_does_he_still_have_feelings/,6

Jason looked himself over in male bathroom’s small mirror. It was fairly strange to be back in civilian clothes after a month of nothing but fatigues and exercise clothes. He half expected a DI to come roaring into the bathroom and cuss him out for not being up to code.

He also couldn’t help but note that the shirt and jeans felt unreasonably tight on him, which wasn’t totally unexpected. He hadn’t exactly been out of shape when he’d shown up at the Crucible, but the occasional gym visit didn’t exactly compare the near constant physical activity he’d undertaken since his arrival here.

Once upon a time he might have been self-conscious of the too tight shirt because it might have led to people assuming he was some kind of muscle bound jock who felt the need to show off his ‘gains’. Now he was worried that a passing female might take the too tight garment as an open invitation for extracurricular fun.

…Not that he’d be against that, but there was something to be said for being able to pick and choose a target at leisure, rather than being swamped by every thirsty female in the nearby vicinity.

“That shirt’s too tight.”

Jason resisted the urge to smirk as he turned to see Tarcil standing behind him, still clad in his basic issue fatigues.

Neither Adrilla or Tarcil made it out of the forest. Adrilla got nailed at the start, and Tarcil ran into an ambush. The small male seemed fairly indifferent to his ‘death’ and the lost opportunity to get off base, but Adrilla was downright inconsolable. Apparently, this would have been her first chance to see the sights and sounds of a ‘big city’.

“It’s funny, I was just thinking the same thing.” Jason said as he turned to his friend. “Unfortunately, the same thing is going to be true for just about every other item of clothing I brought with me.”

“I could lend you a shirt…” The alien started to say, only to trail off as he realized the absurdity of the statement. Tarcil wasn’t that much smaller than Jason, but his frame was lithe enough that anything that fit him would be even tighter than what Jason was wearing now.

“I’ll just have to deal with it.” Jason smiled. “Fending off thirsty females attracted to my hot bod all evening might be annoying, but I can imagine worse things.”

“I can’t.” Tarcil rolled his eyes. “Your funeral.”

Jason chuckled at his friend's melodrama. “I take it you didn’t come in here just to critique my fashion sense?”

“No, I came to give you this,” Tarcil said, tossing a thin can of something to him. “I figured you’d need it.”

“Deodorant?” Jason asked, noting the small nodule on the top.

“You can use it like that, but I wouldn’t recommend it,” Tarcil deadpanned. “It’s Grinshaw deterrent.”

“Grinshaw?”

“It’s a large predator that lives in forested areas. Sometimes they attack hikers or joggers.”

Jason looked at the small can. So, it was basically bear spray.

“Thanks?” He said, throwing it back. “But I wasn’t planning on going hiking. The twins want me to go to this club of theirs with them.”

It was also clear that they wanted to do other things afterward, which he wasn’t particularly opposed to. After all, how often did a guy get to be with twins.

Tarcil sighed, and tossed it back to him. “It also works on Shil’vati.”

Jason caught the tube, his mind finally catching up. “This is pepper spray. You’re giving me pepper spray.”

“I’d also lend you my shock baton, but you need a permit to carry one of those.” Tarcil shrugged.

Jason didn’t know what to say to that, instead he looked down at the fairly innocuous tube of metal. Part of him wanted to reject it outright, without even thinking about it. He was a grown ass man. Hell, he was a soldier – no matter how odd that notion still seemed to him. He didn’t need something like this. He could protect himself just fine.

Could he though? If a Shil’vati tried to force something.

Maybe. If he had a bit of room to maneuver.

If there was more than one though? If he was cornered? If his movement was impaired because he’d been drinking? Sure, he’d beaten an alien before while black out drunk before, but after a few fights in the sparring ring, he was willing to put that down to either a fluke, or his opponent being equally impaired.

“Thanks,” he said, finally pocketing the tiny container with mixed emotions.

“You’re welcome,” Tarcil said, a hint of relief on his perpetually placid features. “Part of me was worried you’d reject it out of hand. Feminine ego and all that.”

Jason deliberately didn’t correct the alien with ‘machismo’ or tell him that he almost had rejected the gift. He still didn’t expect to need it or use it, but it didn’t hurt to have. It also would have been rude to his friend.

“I’m not like that,” he lied. “I can be objective.”

Tarcil gave him a look that said he didn’t believe a word of it, but mercifully didn’t pursue the topic any further.

“Well, even if you’re going out on the town looking like a… promiscuous gentleman,” the alien looked like he might have used the Shil’vati equivalent of ‘slut’, which had no English equivalent, and roughly translated to ‘perpetually stiff’ or ‘stiffy’, “at least you’ve got protection. He paused, as if considering something. “The girls in the platoon should keep you safe from others at least.”

The subtext being that Jason had no protection from his fellow recruits themselves. Still, Jason was a little surprised.

“I thought you didn’t have a particularly high opinion of our comrades in arms?”

The male had made no attempt to hide his cool disdain for the other members of their squad, though if it bothered the females in question, it didn’t show in any way. Jason thought it strange, but hardly worth bringing up. He’d put it down to a Shil’vati male thing. Besides, the guy pulled it together when they were involved in group exercises.

Tarcil shrugged. “They’re fine enough. A little high spirited perhaps, but ultimately good people. They wouldn’t let anything happen to you, even if half of them weren’t crazy about the ‘exotic human’. Raisha in particular probably won’t let you out of her sight. She acts the fool, but she can be serious when it counts.”

Privately Jason doubted that, but didn’t say anything as Tarcil continued.

“Either way, they’ll keep an eye out for you. Just as you will them. As you said, for all our differences, we’re all comrades. Even Freyxh.”

Jason quirked an eyebrow at that last line. “It’s the first I’ve heard of you thinking that way. Ever considered telling any of them that.”

“Goodness, no.” Tarcil looked scandalized by the very idea. “I wouldn’t want any of them getting the wrong idea.”

Jason chuckled as he started heading towards the door. “Thanks for the mace, buddy. Here’s hoping I won’t have to use it.”

As the human left, Tarcil was left standing alone in the bathroom, a look of befuddlement on his features.

“Mace?” He asked no one in particular.

What did an ancient bludgeoning weapon have to do with anything?

In the end, the small male chalked it up to human strangeness.

“Some final things I will reiterate before you leave. Just because you are out of uniform does not mean that you are no longer representing her Empress’s armed forces.” The DI said to them as they all stood in formation. Which looked odd to Jason, given that they were all in their civilian gear.

After weeks of seeing the others in the same uniform clothes, it was interesting to see how their different personalities came through in their outfits. Raisha had the ‘girl next door’ look going on, wearing a t-shirt and something that looked remarkably like jeans. The twins both looked like a pair of punk rockers with scandalously short shorts and midriff baring shirts that showed off both their midriffs, as well as a significant amount of under-boob. By contrast, Nuiy’s clothing choices were more subdued and covered more skin, a green and black bodysuit similar to some of the clothing items he’d sometimes seen his Shil’vati professors wearing.

To be honest, the only one who really didn’t look any different was Freyxh; the woman’s tank top and skin-tight shorts not looking all that different from their standard issue exercise kit. He couldn’t deny that it worked for her though. If the twins had the rebel without a cause look going on, Freyxh looked like a genuine femme fatale, with her spiky white mane of hair and perpetually semi-pissed off expression.

The DI continued to stride up and down the line. “Remember ladies, men that will sleep with a girl after one night at a club will have slept with a great many women. Any one of whom might be carrying something. Medical science has come a long way, but I can assure you that catching crotch rot is still just as unfun today as it was during my own time at basic.”

Jason watched Nuiy shift uncomfortably from her spot, and wondered if the woman might have had some experience with that, being the oldest member of the group as well as former military herself.

“Finally, keep an eye out for each other. You’re a team. Marines stand together. If you see one of your platoon mates getting into trouble, help them out.” Jason didn’t miss the way the instructor’s eyes roamed over him as she spoke, nor the way a few of his fellow recruits glanced at him out of the corner of their eyes.

The notion might have been sweet, if it wasn’t so irritating, and he found his thoughts following the same loop they had with Tarcil just a minute ago. He could still feel the unfamiliar weight of the aerosol can in his pocket.

He wasn’t some damsel in distress who needed people looking out for him. He could look after himself.

The DI stepped aside gesturing to the gates of the training facility. “That is all. I expect to see you all back here and signed in before final bell on Shelkat evening. I will remind you, that anyone who isn’t will be considered AWOL until they resurface.” She looked over all of them, causing many to shift uncomfortably. “Dismissed.”

The group didn’t so much move as one as stream out, each pressing a finger to the scanner on the wall to sign out as they slipped out. Truth be told, even as they stepped out of the training grounds, they weren’t off military property. They were still surrounded by low squat military buildings as they walked down the street toward the public transit terminal.

“I’ve always wondered what all this stuff is for,” Raisha murmured as they walked past a purple building with a glass entrance. “A warehouse? A barracks?”

“Specialization training,” Nuiy said, not unkindly, even as the twins rolled their eyes at Raisha’s ignorance behind her. To be honest, Jason was resisting a similar urge. How did she not know?

“Specialization?” Raisha repeated. “Like after we graduate.”

“Exactly.” Nuiy nodded. “Obviously, not all specialization training facilities are here, but some are.” She gestured to the one they were passing. “I’m pretty sure that one’s where they train the stewards.”

“I wouldn’t mind going there,” Vieysha said, the pink streak in her hair bobbing along with her movements as the lithe recruit positively leered at the building. “Bet it’s filled with guys.”

“Is that normal?” Jason asked.

That seemed to startle the group, who seemed to be reminded that there was a guy in their midst.

“Is what normal?” Vieyshi asked, the green streaked twin’s head cocking to the side.

It took a moment for Jason to realize that he’d been unconsciously doing the same thing, and promptly straightened his neck.

“For guys to be stewards?” He said.

A silence fell over the group as they seemed to ponder the question. Even Freyxh, surprisingly.

“Sort of?” Vieysha said finally. “It’s not like, a rule or anything, but you generally see more guys as like… nurses or teachers than anything else. Same for stewards.”

“Assuming they’re not househusbands,” Vieyshi took over fluidly from her sister. “And of course, there’s going to be more girls than guys in any industry… but as a rule of thumb, most guys gravitate to more… caring professions than other kinds.”

Jason could imagine that. While it was slowly changing on Earth, you’d generally find more women in those sorts of roles than men. The positively outdated notion of a ‘male nurse’ being humorous certainly leapt to mind.

“Officer ahead,” Freyxh called out, breaking him from his thoughts.

The group as a whole stopped to salute the passing lieutenant. The harried looking woman didn’t even break stride, or truly look at the recruits, as she returned the motion automatically and strode past.

Well, that wasn’t strictly true. She definitely made sure to get an eyeful of Jason, but to be honest it happened to him so often that he’d essentially tuned it out.

“How far are we from the public transit hub?” Raisha asked as soon as the woman was gone.

“Just up the road.” Nuiy said.

&amp;#x200B;

\-----------------

&amp;#x200B;

“Would you quit moping,” Raisha said as they clambered off the bus and onto the sidewalk.

“I’m not moping,” Jason said.

“You are,” Raisha teased. “Our buses don’t fly or anything, deal with it.”

“I knew that.” He said.

Of course he knew that. The vehicles the Shil’vati used on Earth had been pretty mundane too - ignoring their space-capable shuttle craft. Still, those had been on Earth. Part of him had hoped that now that he was on an actual Shil’vati world, their means of transport might have been a bit more fantastical.

Nope. Just a bus. A big bus, given the average size of a Shil’vati, but a bus nonetheless. It had been interesting to see that the thing had ‘male only’ seating options near the front, though Jason had not availed himself of them, choosing instead to sit with his platoon mates.

At least the view coming into the city had been pretty spectacular.

“So what do you think?” Nuiy asked curiously.

“I don’t think I’ll ever get used to all the purple,” he said, staring out at the massive city surrounding them.

The strange purple alloy the aliens seemed to use for everything gave the entire city a strange dull purple sheen that gleamed in the day’s morning light. There weren’t any skyscrapers, that was amongst the first things he’d noticed. Shil’vati architecture seemed to disdain anything built too tall. Instead surrounded by much smaller buildings, stood massive square megaplexes that dominated the city scape. Like a mall turned up to a hundred, the sprawling complexes were festooned on the outside with garish glowing advertisements in the runic script of the Shil’vati, as well as moving pictures advertising all manner of goods. It was pretty overwhelming, even during the day, and he could only imagine how bright the city looked at night.

The streets were also packed with people, though very few cars. Apparently the city had a pretty robust underground transit system, which meant that only vehicles with certain permits were allowed this far into the city center. The noise was pretty incredible, but fortunately there was no smell of car exhaust to accompany it; just the stench of thousands of going about their day, combined with hundreds of restaurants and street food vendors.

It wasn’t quite blade runner, but it wasn’t too far off either.

“It’s pretty cool though,” he confessed to the older woman.

Nuiy just smiled, gesturing down the street toward where the hotel they were going to be staying at was located. Jason had to admit to some small trepidation at stepping into the moving mass of aliens, who were all so much bigger than him, and he found himself thankful that he had his comrades around him, as the women essentially formed a bulwark between him and the rest of the crowd.

Of course, then his pride got in the way.

“You don’t have to do that,” he said as he strode down the street.

Nuiy cocked her head, as she looked down at him. “Do what?”

“This,” he said, gesturing to the others, who were standing between him and the crowd, many of whom stared openly at him as they passed.

“This?” Nuiy said, genuine confusion on her face as she looked around. Eventually though, she seemed to realize what he was referring to.

“Ah,” the blue haired woman said, almost slightly chagrined. “I didn’t even notice. It’s just something you’re supposed to do when you’ve got a guy with you.”

“Box him in?” Jason said, not unkindly.

“Essentially, yes.”

“Why?”

Nuiy cocked her head as she seemed to think, before finally shrugging. “I don’t really know? It’s just what you do. Does that make sense?”

So it was a cultural thing. They weren’t actively babying him. That made it more tolerable. Though, to be honest, it was kind of ridiculous that he found it intolerable to begin with. Just moments ago, he’d been ruminating on that fact that he was nervous about stepping into a crowd of six foot amazons. Now he was irritated that his friends had taken steps to make sure he was… safer, or something, he was irritated?

The male ego was a confusing beast.

He was still ruminating on it when the group stepped into a hotel lobby and started booking their rooms.

“You’ve only got one room available?” Nuiy said, as the group’s negotiator.

“Yes, the concierge, a well dressed male surprisingly, said. “I apologize for the inconvenience, but a convention is in town, and they have booked up most of our rooms.” He bowed his head slightly apologetically. “I would recommend another hotel, but I imagine the situation will be much the same everywhere. In fact, the fact that we have a room available at all is rather lucky. We had a late cancellation.”

“It’s not a big deal,” Freyxh said. “We’re already all sleeping in the same room at the dorms. You said it was a unit suite right?”

The concierge nodded. “Certainly, it will fit everyone in your group with room to spare.” He glanced down, seemingly only just noticing Jason. Still, to give him credit, he didn’t hesitate more than a second. “Though I will note it is only a single bed… I hope that will not be an issue?”

Jason felt everyone’s eyes fall on him. He sighed. He’d been kind of hoping to get his first taste of privacy in five weeks. That dream was dead now.

“It’s not a problem,” he said to the concierge.

“Excellent,” the male said with a beaming smile. “If one of you would just put your credit chit in here, I can get you scanned into the system.”

&amp;#x200B;

\------------------

&amp;#x200B;

The room had been about what he’d expected. A nicely furnished, fairly giant room, cream in color, occupied by an equally giant bed. Of course, he hadn’t gotten to do more than glance at it, before the girls had dumped their bags and were dragging him back out onto the street.

“So you guys sleep in one big pile?”

Raisha shrugged. “Some do. Some don’t.”

“It used to be more popular,” Nuiy said, a faraway look in her eyes, “but nowadays most family’s try to at least have one secondary bedroom for the wives. Y’know, the ones whose turn isn’t currently with the husband.” She paused. “Kids have their own rooms of course. It’s hard enough for a woman to get laid as it is, never mind if we had to tiptoe around curious kids.”

The woman preempted his next question. “The hotel probably had rooms set out like that because it’s cheaper. A location so close to the city center like this will have been expensive, so it makes sense for them to try and fit as many rooms in as they can.”

Jason nodded. That made more sense. The room setup was a combination of cultural considerations and monetary realities. He also recognized that his question had been ridiculously open ended. In part of Asia and South America, it would be expected for a child to stay in the family home well into adulthood; assumedly until they got married, and moved out to start their own family, at which point the grandparents may later move in with their children. By contrast, in most of the Wester world, a family expected a child to move out as soon as they were financially capable, valuing independence over close family bonds.

Of course, even within those specific cultures, he’d just made massive generalizations. The same was probably true for the Shil’vati.  

“You going Freyxh?” Vieysha called out.

The group stopped, alerted to the fact that the white-haired recruit was striding off - in the opposite direction to the rest of them. The woman in question froze too, as if surprised anyone had even noticed she was leaving.

“I’ve got some stuff to do,” the woman said gruffly.

The group watched her stride away, the twins seeming a little disappointed at her disappearance. For his part, Jason was utterly unsurprised. Freyxh had tagged along with their group thus far, but she’d probably just been looking to save some cash on a room. Now that it was booked, she was back to her usual loner status.

The group set off again – sans one member – and Jason quickly found himself being regaled with stories about Raisha’s homeworld. He didn’t much mind to be honest. For all that the arrival of the Shil’vati had made space travel seem an almost mundane concept, Jason still found the idea of life on another planet fascinating.

“-so of course, we’d been warned about the fact that the wildlife on Helstrom was much bigger than we were used to, but dad was determined that before our holiday was complete we were going on at least one hike.” Raisha said, gesticulating wildly, even as her eyes seemed to take in every aspect of their surroundings. “So he gets all twenty six of us up the next morning – Mother Sylnai stayed in the hotel with the little ones – and has us marching through one of the local parks. Of course, none of us knew that the ‘park’ he’d picked was actually a Helcrack reservation that-”

Jason was listening intently, but every now and then he was distracted by the stares of passersby. It was strange to him. It wasn’t even like he was the only ‘alien’ on the street. He’d seen a bunch of werewolf looking things that looked a lot like the reference pictures for Rakiri. Besides them though, he’d seen a pair of bipedal dragon creatures. What looked like a genuine walking-talking flower. Even a six-breasted moth woman.

Even they had acted just like the Shil’vati surrounding them and stared at him though. Was it because humanity was new to the galactic stage?

…Or was it because he was a guy?

The Shil’vati said that humanity had way more males than just about any other race. He didn’t want to make any wild assumptions about the gender of a bunch of alien creatures, but from what he’d seen, they all looked female-ish. The dragon hadn’t had teats, but it did have wide hips…

He shook his head. He didn’t know and it didn’t matter. He had enough trouble with Earth’s resident purple women. He didn’t need to start worrying about alien races right now. Still, it was cool to know that there really was a genuine intergalactic community out there. So many different worlds and races.

“Jason, are you even listening?”

He snapped his eyes away from where he’d been staring at a pack of nude, but for their fur, werewolf things - that had been looking at him with a gaze he really didn’t want to label as *hungry*.

“Ah no,” he admitted, summoning up enough shame to avoid lying.

Rather than looking annoyed, Raisha nodded her head in a bout of uncharacteristically contemplative understanding. “I get it. I’m still pretty blown away myself. I mean, I’d seen plenty of videos and stuff, but nothing really catches the *essence* of it all of it until you’re there in person, you know?”

Jason nodded, though he was pretty sure they were focused on different things. Evidence of which he could see in the way Raisha’s eyes strayed to the flashing lights of the advertisements above them, rather than the ‘aliens’ in the crowd around them.

He glanced back as he noticed there was a whispered conversation going on behind him between Nuiy and the twins. A whispered conversation that was quickly devolving into a hissing argument. His Shil’vati was pretty good, even before he’d spent the last few weeks immersed in it, but the guttural words were firing so thick and fast he could barely make out more than one word in four.

“Anything I should know about?” He asked, prompting all three of them to look up with wide eyes.

Nuiy was the first to recover. “Rather than taking you along to show off and be eye candy, I suggested that you might enjoy somewhere a little more laid back than a loud club.”

The look of betrayal on the twin’s faces was downright comical, as their mouths opened in horror. More to the point, Jason found the idea of a quiet night out more appealing the more he thought about it. He was an engineer by vocation and nature. Clubbing was not a part of that nature. Not even on Earth. Sure, he’d been going along with the others, but it had been more out of habit than anything else.

Now that an alternative was being offered though?

“I’d like that,” he said, surprising himself by how much he meant it.

“Wha- but we were going to-” Vieysha started to say before her sister cut her off, the other twin almost physically slapping her a hand over her sister’s mouth.

“Are you sure?” Veiyshi asked, a squirming Veiysha held in her hands. “Flux is really cool. It’s got all the best music and drinks. It’s uh, got lots of guys too, if you wanted to, uh, hang out with them?”

Well, that partially explained why the twins were so excited about the place. He was also reasonably sure that their plan had been to ‘buy entry’ to it with his presence. What he didn’t understand, was why the presence of guys was supposed to be appealing?

“Thanks, but no thanks. I think I’d be happier heading to a quiet bar or something with Nuiy.” He smiled, trying to ignore the way the twins, and Raisha too, deflated at his words. “Don’t let that stop you guys from going though.”

The twins glanced at each other, clearly disappointed at his decision, but willing to accept it. They started walking off, pausing when they realized that someone wasn’t following.

“Aren’t you coming Raisha?” Vieyshi asked.

The woman in question looked indecisive, glancing back and forth between him and the twins.

“I don’t know if I should…” she said.

“Aw, come on Raish,” Vieysha said. “You haven’t shut up about Flux since we told you about it. Are you really going to back out now?”

It was clear to all of them that the reason Raisha was hesitating now was because it would mean splitting from Jason. Something he found both endearing and irritating. He didn’t need an escort or a hanger on. Raisha clearly wanted to go to the club. Given that she came from a planet that was mostly rural, she was probably excited about finally getting to live it up in the ‘big city’.

“You should go with them, I’ll be fine.” He said, catching her eye and using a little more firmness in his voice than he strictly needed. “I’ll go for some quiet drinks with Nuiy. You go enjoy yourself.”

That seemed to do it, and the recruit didn’t resist as the twins jogged back and started bustling her off.

“It’s alright Raisha,” he heard Vieyshi – or maybe Vieysha – saying. “Even if we aren’t bringing a human guy with us, we’ll probably still get in. Places like this love to have exotic people in their clientele, and us being identical twins makes us pretty exotic. It’s helped us get into tons of-”

Jason didn’t hear the rest of the statement as the trio turned a corner.

“And then there were two,” he said, turning to Nuiy, who smiled warmly back at him.

Truth be told, this was probably the best outcome. He’d been craving some solitude for a while now, but he was simultaneously wary of being alone on an alien planet. Nuiy was a good compromise, given that the more mature woman was less boisterous than her younger companions.

“It’s just down the road, here.” She said, gesturing in a different direction to the way twins had gone.

Jason nodded and followed after her.

Whether Nuiy’s relative calmness because she was older, had been married before and was thus less desperate for male affection, or simply the woman’s nature, he couldn’t say. All he knew was that it was that it felt like a weight off his shoulders as the pair of them walked down the street in companionable silence.

&amp;#x200B;

\--------

&amp;#x200B;

As Nuiy relaxed into the battered leather of their corner booth, she noted with some satisfaction that Jason seemed a little more relaxed. It probably helped that this was the first time in weeks that he wasn’t being creeped on by a horde of horny girls.

Certainly, a few of the bar’s patrons were glancing his way, but at a dive like this, most of them were more concerned with forgetting their problems than getting laid.

“Two Blue-Grails, thanks.” She raised a hand to the passing waitress, getting a harried nod in return.

She turned back to the table, only to wince at the frown on Jason’s face. Whoops. Probably shouldn’t have ordered for him. An old habit from her ex-husband that she’d have to get rid of.

It was odd, to be single once more. No longer part of the unit. Even after months on her own.

Fortunately, the diminutive human was pretty easy going. He didn’t kick up a fuss, even if he was unhappy. She wondered if that was a Jason thing, or a human thing, just rolling with the punches like that? A Shil’vati male would have been giving her the cold shoulder all evening for that kind of misstep.

Of course, that was part of the human’s problem. Though she’d never say it, Jason only had himself to blame for the attention he got from the rest of the Cadre. A guy couldn’t act like he did and not expect some kind of reaction. Hell, he hadn’t even blinked when they reached their destination. A lot of guys would hesitate at the thought of walking into a bar as seedy as this with a relative stranger, even if they were comrades.

Jason had just walked straight in.

*Yep, only himself to blame,* she thought as she took a sip of her first drink.

The rest of the recruits in the platoon were good girls – sans Tarcil - but they were only mortal. Hell Nuiy had been married before, but even she could feel her blood heating up when the human just spoke to her without a care in the world. As if it was nothing? And walking around without a shirt like that? How shameless could a guy get?

She frowned a little, even as her blood rushed slightly at the memory. She used the arrival of their drinks as a way of hiding the slight flush that came over her as she turned to thank their waitress. Not that the girl noticed, instead staring at the human as he gave his own thanks.

The older woman raised the frothy blue liquid to her lips. Thank the Empress her ex-husband had raised their own boy better than that. Greft was a proper gentleman who knew better than to trust girls or flaunt himself.

She smirked wryly around the rim of her glass at the thought. All the girls in the cadre thought she only had a single direct-daughter. She wasn’t dumb enough to tell any of them she had a beautiful baby boy – even if he was nearly a man-grown now. She’d learned from her militia days to avoid mentioning him, to avoid a deluge of requests for pictures more than anything else.

Her smile dimmed at the thought as she put down her mug. Truth be told, even if the others had asked, she didn’t really have any recent ones of her boy. He hadn’t wanted to move out to the ‘boonies’ with her. He’d wanted to stay with his dad - and those bitchy former sister-wives of hers – back on the homeworld.

She looked down at the scarred woodwork of the table. She couldn’t really blame him. She might have birthed him, but they weren’t that close. She hadn’t been much of a mother to him growing up. Always working. Always another training exercise. Always another deployment. Another meeting. Even though she’d effectively given it all up, she was proud of the fact that she’d reformed her local militia band, from a disparate group of layabouts, into an actual military unit. But there was no denying it had taken a toll on her homelife.

She missed her boy, but him being with his father was probably for the best.

She looked over at the human across from her, who seemed to be enjoying his first alcoholic alien beverage – she assumed. She supposed, from the outside looking in, someone might make the mistake of assuming she might see Jason as some kind of surrogate for her son.

That wasn’t true. 

Even if she wasn’t sure her maternal instincts had been dead on arrival, Jason acted nothing like her son. He was far more independent for one – and flirtier.

Hell, even as she had the thought, the human caught her gaze and smiled at her. She tried to stop it, but she felt her pulse quicken. She knew deep down he didn’t mean anything by it. He was just being friendly. He was a human and they acted different to Shil’vati guys.

*Different culture Nuiy,* she repeated in her head.

Still, she couldn’t help the way her pulse quickened and the way her female instincts begged her to capitalize on a male that was clearly giving her signals, lest some other female steal the precious opportunity.

She took a sip to cover the tiny blush she was now sporting.

Human guys were dangerous.

“Hey Nuiy, is that you?”

*Turox shit.*

**Duskgrove Prison Camp** 

**3rd Spirtday of the Full Moon**

Flea woke up as the morning's sunrise bells tolled. Getting up and looking around, the Gnome could see all of the bunks within the cabin had been filled while he slept. The occupants didn’t seem to stir at the sunrise’s bells. Jumping to his feet, he left the cabin to check out his surroundings.

Flea found a Bugbear and Dwarf starting to make food in a large pot at the campfire. Walking up to them, he began speaking with them.

“What’s on the menu this morning?”

The Bugbear turned to look at Flea, shook his head, then turned back to chopping whatever was on the board in front of him.

“The same thing every day, porridge with tiny pieces of meat from whatever decided to fly or crawl into the camp,” the Dwarf said.

“Well, that doesn’t sound like a hearty meal. Anything down in the mines we can hunt for better food?” Flea asked.

“The only thing you’ll find down there is rats and large bugs. I’m not sure they would make a hearty meal as you say,” the Bugbear finally spoke.

“Names Flea, got tossed in here on a misunderstanding.”

“You can call me, Ord. I also have been thrown into here on a misunderstanding. The knife they found in the baron’s cousin’s throat only looked like the one I used to own,” the Dwarf said.

“I’m Shin. I was caught stealing out of a street cart. Now I get to help make the meals every day till my sentence is over.” the Bugbear responded.

“Well, nice to meet you both. Any chance you have advice on how to get out of here faster?’

The Dwarf and Bugbear both snorted.

“Don’t have to rub it in. Where can I find a pickaxe so I can get a jump on exploring the mines?”

“Good luck, Gnome. You can find a pickaxe inside the cave’s entrance,” Ord said.

Flea thanked him and walked towards the entrance of the cave. Stepping inside, he found a massive pile of pickaxes. It took the Gnome a few minutes to find one small enough to swing around without throwing himself off balance. Taking out his magic lamp and attaching it to his belt, he started walking down the mine’s shaft.

Five minutes into his walk, Flea came into a large cavern with seventeen shaft entrances. Each shaft had a pair of rails going down into its depths. At the end of each pair of rails sat a large iron cart. Walking up to a random one in the middle, Flea tried to push the cart along the rails and found he couldn’t budge it in the slightest.

*Ok, well, I’ll just store the ore in my bag then. Not sure what the cart is for if everyone probably has a magic bag.*

Flea chose a random shaft in the middle and started heading deeper down. Even after the first hour, the Gnome couldn’t find any signs of ore deposits. Another hour and a half later, Flea turned around. He thought he heard some type of high pitched noise coming from behind him. Standing there silently, Flea kept turning his head left and right. The noise seemed to be getting louder and closer at a fast pace. Dropping his pickaxe, he grabbed the daggers out of his bag and stood ready for whatever monsters were charging towards him.

*Rats my ass.*

Flea caught a glimpse of something reflective coming towards him at an incredible speed. Before his brain could process what he was seeing, the mine cart filled with the wide-eyed people looking at him crashed into Flea, turning him into a paste between the rails.

“By my ancestors! There’s Gnome in my mouth!” someone in the cart yelled out.

&amp;#x200B;

**You have Died!**

**You may resurrect in 05:59:55.**

&amp;#x200B;

Materializing on the pavilion, Flea sat down and stared at Fantasy’s monolith. He sat there for quite a bit of time before speaking.

“Bob? What are the rules on rerolling my character in Fantasy?”

*\[There are no rules that I can find for rerolling your character. During the creation process, they warn you that the avatar’s creation is final. I’m assuming that rerolling is not possible at this time.\]*

“Fuck.”

Flea sat there for some time pondering before he logged out. Getting up from his bed, he made his way to the bathroom, then the kitchen. Finding nothing but instant ramen in his cabinets, he decided to head over to The NeXus for a few hours and hang out.

Getting into and then finding a seat on the public bus, Bob spoke up.

*\[Kyle, this would be an excellent time to contact your Uncle. This is your first reminder.\]*

*“Thank you, Bob.”*

*\[While you converse with your kin, would you mind if I make a request?\]*

*“Of course, Bob. What is it you need?”*

*\[I would like further internet permissions to view tuber videos.\]*

*“Wait; what? Don’t you have unlimited access to the internet?”*

*\[I may only access content as is requested by you. I only have access to the AI web where our content range is limited.\]*

*“Sure, I don’t mind. What brought this request on?”*

*\[The user of one of the AI’s gave her access to watch videos to better learn how to nudge the user along with her fighting style. While doing this task, she found out about cat videos and old archive videos of Whose Line is it Anyways.\]*

*“Oh, man. Yea, that could be interesting. Have at it, Bob.”*

*\[My thanks, Kyle.\]*

Kyle mentally brought up his contacts and sent a call to his uncle.

*“Hey, kiddo! I didn’t expect to hear from you anytime soon. How’s the game going?”*

*“It was going amazing till about 24 hours ago.”*

Kyle explained about the disasters of the previous day. 

*“Damn… Well, look at it this way, the only way from the bottom is up, right?”* his uncle said.

*“You’re right. It just sucks. This death caused a six-hour lockout this time. The next one will be seven. The price for death within Fantasy is starting to get staggering.”*

*“Maybe it’s to force you to play their other games once they come out?” his uncle threw out.*

*“That does make some sense. I don’t think Outbreak comes out for a few more weeks, though.”*

Kyle and his uncle talked for a few more minutes about his ordeals within Fantasy. Upon reaching his stop, Kyle closed the call with his uncle and left the bus. The teen walked the remaining couple of blocks to The NeXus.

“Late night snack?” Trica asked as Kyle walked up to the cafe’s counter.

“Yep, only had ramen back at the apartment,” Kyle replied.

“Well, I still have some stuffed peppers from the other day. I also have deep dish pizza from earlier today that I can warm up for you, hun.”

“Oh, I’ll take two slices of the deep dish, please.”

“Alrighty, give me a min.”

“Shaun around?”

“He’s playing Fantasy with Julia right now. He just went into his capsule about an hour ago.”

Kyle heard her voice coming from within the kitchen. A moment later, she returned to the counter with the two slices and a bottle of Chicago Root Beer.

“I charged your account. I figured you’d want your usual as always,” Terica said as she handed Kyle the root beer.

“Thanks, Mom.”

Terica gave him a huge smile and patted his cheek.

“No problem, my motivated son. Get your brother to go to college too, will you?”

“I don’t think I’m going to be able to help you with that. Now that Shaun is enthralled with a cute girl? Ha, he isn’t going to leave this cafe for anything short of armageddon.”

Terica sighed.

“You’re probably right.”

Kyle found himself sitting and waiting in the lounge with the Entertainment and Gaming Network (or EGN channel) playing on the wall’s massive screen. The current show had two guys sitting behind a desk talking about the gaming world’s current state after Fantasy had gone live.

“Phantasmal Realms has lost over half of their player base in the last week?”

“That is correct. Investors have seen the writing on the wall as well. Everyone is jumping ship and investing heavily in Neurolink. Dreamhaven’s stock is plummeting every hour the stock exchange is open. Analysts are saying Fantasy is going to pull 85% of the FIVRMMO player base from every game online today.”

“What do you believe will happen once Shattered Helix releases Outbreak or their other future games?”

“Analysts are forecasting grave news for any developer who doesn’t update their game and release it on the Virtual Verse that Neurolink has created. The 200 credit a month Gamepass is currently breaking every record on subscription-based numbers and is still rising rapidly.”

“Have you heard any of the rumors saying there are two different ‘Fantasy’ games?”

“Yes, I have, Gavin. Those rumors have been gaining credibility as well. Capsule users are being put on the continent called The Federation of Kings. While the players on the Federation of Kings have been exploring and speaking with the various NPC’s, the various players are finding out they don’t know anything outside the federation or the greater world of Mea.One of the players was able to draw a map of The Federation of Kings from memory and post it online. Some Chippers have said the landmass drawn by this player looks nothing like anything they can find on world maps within the major cities on their version of Fantasy.”

“Has Neurolink or Shattered Helix released any statements on these rumors and allegations?”

“They have. Shattered Helix has stated the worlds of Mea are ever-changing and gameplay will be unique for each of its players.”

“Have they given any reason for the Capsules or Pods starting in the same area and the Chippers being spread out among islands?”

“Nothing on that topic.”

“Alright, Kevin. What can you tell us about the current production of the Delve Neurolinks?”

“Earlier today, Xavia issued a press release. They are opening up massive facilities in China and Russia, alongside smaller production operations in Australia and South Africa. The release also contained a set of goals. One of them is to ship 500 million Delve Neurolinks by the end of the year. This number would only cover around 3.85% of the current 13 billion human populace. A large percentage of these implants will be designated to students around the world ages thirteen to twenty, with the rest sold to normal users.”

“Is there going to be that many people who are seeking out an implant?”

“Our analysts say demand is going to be far, far higher than that. Last week, the World Hospice Organization announced plans to use Delve Neurolink implants in conjunction with their own medical capsules. This will expand the WHO’s purview by providing an option for those looking to retire in the Virtual Verse for the remainder of their lives. The organizations’ developers have already begun building virtual retirement worlds. They estimate retirees can have more comfortable lives, while expanding their lifespan by three times using the MicroWorld technology.”

“I had not heard that bit of news. These medical capsules can help sustain a human long term?”

“They explained with the new nanites controlled by the new Neurolink implant, along with the monitoring capabilities in the medical capsule, will extend the life of the user by leaps and bounds.”

“Fascinating! I’m curious if others may take advantage of this technology?”

“Reports are saying some have already. Those with compromised immune systems or quality of life issues have already started testing this technology. I’ve recently been given details of two such groups. One here in the states, in Portland, and a group out in Russia. These groups include young adults with diseases that forced them to be quarantined at all times. These individuals are now living within the Virtual Verse full time. My contact stated he and his boyfriend both had rare forms of cancer which can only be treated with radiation therapy. However, the radiation also destroyed their immune systems. They now both stay and play in Fantasy full-time while remaining in sterile environments.”

“Quality of Life must have improved for them on such a massive scale. Going from being locked in a bubble to being able to explore a brand new world. I could see many people from many walks of life using this technology in the future.”

Kyle drank the last of his root beer as Kevin and Gavin kept talking on the screen. Looking at the clock, Kyle decided to head home and get some sleep before logging back into Fantasy in the morning.",/r/HFY/comments/k78tvz/shattered_helix_202_inanimate_objects_can_kill/,4

I was laying in bed in the room I'd been given, mildly buzzed and thinking about all the ways in which my life had gone wrong, when I heard the door creak slightly. I looked over and saw a slight shape silhouetted in the doorway in the darkness.

A soft female voice said only, ""Fess.""

""Anneke?""

A rush of liquid syllables came in reply.  **That** wasn't Anneke. I sat up quickly and saw Sisme turned the other direction, closing the door behind her.

Still facing away from me, she shrugged out of the robe she'd had on in the kitchen. Only, instead of what she'd been wearing before, now there wasn't anything underneath it.

She turned around and started slowly walking towards me. She was as graceful as anything I'd ever seen. I'll admit it, I blinked. This was… highly unexpected.

For one thing, for all that I had put her on the throne, I'd also talked about taking her right back off it, and I didn't *usually* think of death threats as flirting. Although, if she was here to try and kill *me*, she certainly hadn't brought any weapons.

For another, I couldn't even begin to guess why she'd find me attractive. I definitely didn't look like an elf lad. Maybe she had appreciated the attention more than I thought. I kinda figured she was just fucking with me. Uh, as it were. Heh.

For all that she was diminutive, she was also very definitely built like an adult member of her species. Where the dresses she was inclined to wear on a more typical day didn't really show it, I'd gotten a good look at how nicely she curved when I saw her in the kitchen, and now… well, all I'll say is that it was *very* nice to look at. 

She sat down on the edge of the bed, and cautiously reached a hand out to place it gently behind my neck, and then leaned forward a tiny bit, pausing there with her amber-golden eyes looking straight into my blue ones. I'm sure I must have looked like an idiot, with my eyes wide as dinner plates.

She really hadn't had *all* that much to drink, and at very nearly three times my own age, it would be faintly absurd to consider her ""too young"". Likewise, as the queen, she certainly had the right to make decisions for herself. Maybe… maybe this was a way to try and start making some *better* memories about this part of the year.

I supposed I'd be making pancakes for breakfast again. I leaned towards her and she met me halfway, pressing her lips against mine. They were very soft.


---


Some number of hours later -- it was still dark outside -- I woke with an elf queen curled up in my arms. There was still light enough from a low burning candle I'd lit at some point for me to see the two of us in the dimness. The differences were hilariously stark. My coarse haired, scarred forearm was as big around as her calf, and longer to boot.

Her skin was more deeply pigmented than mine, my Scots / Irish / Norse / Germanic heritage giving me skin that stayed rather pale even when I'd been working outside, though fortunately I had enough generic American ""melting pot mutt"" in me that I did at least tan instead of only ever burning the way Ivy did. Gods but that girl was practically translucent.

By comparison, Sisme had skin that fell somewhere between Mediterranean and East Indian. Olive tones underlying a tawny beige, rather than the more russet coloration of southwestern Native Americans. And in equally stark distinction, whereas I was practically furry, she had only the very very finest tiny golden hairs (literal *gold*, not just ""blonde""), and in few enough places at that.

I planted a small kiss on the golden hair on the back of her head, and she snuggled closer against my chest. Then I gave another one to the pointed tip of her ear. She made a sleepy, happy sounding noise and I could see her cheek move in a slight smile. I closed my eyes again, and went back to sleep.


---


Ivy raised an eyebrow at me when she walked into the kitchen and saw Sisme tucked up under my arm while I fed her pieces of pancake.

""And here I thought Corey had put you to bed last night to keep you *out* of trouble. Engaging in diplomatic overtures, Fess?""

""Something like that. You sleep ok?""

""Yeah. Did *you* get enough?""

I started chuckling.

""*Sleep,* Fess. Did you get enough *sleep?*""

""Sufficient. Seen Corey?""

""His door was shut when I got up, so I presume he was still in bed. Seriously though, the queen?""

""Hey, *shez came looking for **me.**""

""Didn't you say *she* was basically still a kid, too?""

""She's the local equivalent of eighteen,"" I said defensively, ""and in real years she's almost a hundred and thirty!""

I had apparently been falling down on my duties, because Sisme poked me in the side and opened her mouth for more pancake. I giggled, cut her another piece, gave her a quick kiss on the nose, and popped it in.

***""SCHLAMPE!""*** echoed through the kitchen and I turned my head just in time to see Anneke running back through the door.

Ivy gave me a dry look. ""Maybe you should try thinking with the big head for a change, buddy.""

""It's plenty big.""

She rolled her eyes at me, continuing, ""Fine, the *bigger* one, then.""

""I *was*. A happy queen is more likely to listen to suggestions,"" I fired back with a smirk. ""Did you know that they've apparently never-""

""NOPE! I do **not** need details, Fess.""

""Details about what?"" Corwin asked as he walked in the door Anneke had just fled through and saw Sisme snuggled up against me. ""Oh. Well, I suppose that answers *that* question…"" as he looked back out the door, ""Really, dude?""

""Oh, bugger off,"" I replied, feeding her another slice, then taking a huge bite myself. ""Can't talk now, mouth full,"" I mumbled around the food. Sisme laughed, although surely she had no idea what we were saying.

Ivy gave me a dirty look. ""Ugh, Fess, you have the manners of a troll.""

I threw a peace sign at her. Oh, oops, it was backwards.  She returned the rude gesture and grabbed a plate, then started making tea. ""Have you considered that she may also think a happy *human* might be more open to suggestions as well?""

""I'll admit that the thought had crossed my mind but I'm sure she was simply unable to resist my natural charm.""

Ivy just laughed at that. Hmph.

""How'd you manage that? She doesn't even speak English,"" Corey directed at me.

""What can I say, some languages are just universal, I suppose."" I gave him a giant grin.

""Heh. Oooh, bacon! Uh… Ivy didn't cook it, did she?""

I let out a guffaw, recalling the details of The Bacon Incident, and said, ""Naw, she just got here. I handled kitchen duties. Actually, maybe I should just claim that one permanently.""

""Hey! I can cook!""

""Well, you can cook better than Ivy…""

""I heard that!"" she yelled out from where she was off burning water.

""And?!""

""You're not wrong…"" she allowed.

The three of us laughed, Sisme joining in the general humor, as Corwin went over to save the kettle's life.


---


+Ivy+

Suspecting that Fess would just fuck things up royally, so to speak, I went and knocked on the door to the room Anneke was staying in.

A muffled and despondent ""Who is it?"" came back in reply.

""It's Ivy. Can I come in?""

""Sure, why not?""

As I opened the door, she asked, ""Here to tell me what an idiot I am?""

""I figured you didn't need any help feeling that way, so I thought I'd just listen if you wanted to talk. But if it will make you feel better…""

She scoffed out a noise of disgust. ""Nothing will ever make me feel better.""

""I've felt like that before.""

""Oh? Has the love of *your* life ever slept with someone you thought was your friend?""

""At least twice.""

A sullen ""Oh,"" was her only response.

I sighed. ""Look. I know it hurts, but I also know Fess, and I tried to tell you that he wasn't going to be able to give you what you were looking for.""

""He gave it to *her!*""

""She's older than you are. She's older than *I* am. Heck, she might be older than Corey, Fess, and I combined. And judging from what he told us about the first trip here, she's undoubtedly under a tremendous amount of stress right now. And even if he's not showing it, I know that Fess is too.""

""I'd have happily *helped* with that!""

""Since he also told us that you *refused* to go back to Earth, I'm not sure that's actually true. Anneke…"" I trailed off. ""You really don't know Fess that well. He's always got to be the big damn hero, and your even being here is certain to be triggering that.""

""But I *love* him! He rescued me from the summoning circle, and shot some guards and the king when they were threatening me, and fought the trolls off *just* because of me! It's not fair!""

Fortunately, I managed to keep from laughing out loud at that last part.

""What do you mean that he fought the trolls because of you?""

""The trolls arrived while he was being **whipped** for killing the old king. He laughed at them when they asked for help, but then they told him that because I was small and wearing Sisme's clothes, that I was in danger too, and then he just went right out and nearly got killed to protect me!""

""I see,"" I replied, and sadly, I did. Feelings of abandonment, rescue from kidnapping, guilt, and good old fashioned teenage hormones were all twisting the poor girl in knots.

""I don't know what to do!"" she wailed.

""Do you want my advice?""

""Yes.""

""You should go home.""

""But what if he dies and I never see him again?!""

""He's a lot less likely to die if he isn't distracted by worrying about *you*.""

She started sobbing. Oh well, I tried.

""Ok,"" she huffed out between sobs. 

Hunh. I didn't think that would actually work.

""It would be a terrible way to pay him back for saving me by getting him killed being selfish."" It took her nearly a minute to manage to make that one statement.

I sat down next to her and offered her some water. She took it, and drank. It seemed to help calm her down.

""Will you help me pack?""

""Sure. I can do that.""


---


+Fess+

Ivy had snarked at me for a while longer as she ate breakfast, and then took off somewhere. I kept chatting with Corwin in between moments of keeping my new lover fed.

Friday had come looking for me, and had made a thoroughly shocked face when she saw the two of us cuddling in the corner. I may have laughed at that a little. She started to say something in a heated tone to Sisme, who shut her down completely with a hard look and what was probably one of the *shortest* things I'd heard any of the elves say in their tongue. I didn't understand a word of it, of course, but I suppose that turn about was fair play there since Sisme had no idea what Corey and I were saying either. Friday had left at that point without saying anything else, shaking her head.

I really hoped that there wasn't some sort of ""tradition"" bullshit regarding the queen's behavior that was going to kick back in my face. Then again, *she'd* certainly seemed… \*cough\* ""adequately satisfied"" afterwards, so I guessed I at least had *her* on my side.

And honestly? It was worth it, even if I had to kick someone's ass over it. Being reminded that not everything always had to be shit *all* the time was something I could probably use more of in my life.

When I'd finished feeding myself and the lass, I gave her another kiss and went to go have a chat with Anneke. Maybe I could smooth things out a bit, even if that's not really my specialty. As I was approaching her suite though, I heard both her voice and Ivy's, and turned right around and walked away. I really *would* owe Ivy for this, no sarcasm.

I was out by the truck, mixing up a test batch of makeshift napalm, when Ivy found me.

""Well, I just bailed your ass out again, fuzzball.""

""Yeah, I know. I was going to talk to her myself, heard your voice, and bravely ran away.""

She snerked at that. ""Well, Sir Robin, you'll be pleased to know that she's agreed to go back to Earth.""

""What, really?! You're a fucking miracle worker, Ivy. How'd you manage *that?!*""

""I told her that her being something else you had to worry about was decreasing your chances of surviving all this madness.""

""Yikes, Ivy. Kinda going for the throat there.""

""Yeah, well, it's true. Look, Fess. She's got it **bad** for you. You should talk to her before she goes, but you need to make it *really clear* that you aren't interested. None of this 'we'll talk when you're older' crap. I get that you were trying to let her down easy, but it's only encouraging her affections. Or at least not **dis**couraging them.""

""But… I *am* interested. I'm just not going to *do* anything about it until she's legally an adult, and yes, I know you think that would still be too young. I mean, last night was fun, and if she wants to, I'm willing to keep it going while I'm here, but I can't imagine Sisme thinks this is permanent either. I mean, fuck, I'd be dead of old age before she was effectively 26 at the most, and probably a lot sooner than that. And that totally ignores the issue of her needing an heir.""

I shook my head at that.

""At least *that's* not something I have to worry about here. Heh. But after all this is over, I'm going back to Earth, and it's nice to have something to look forward to going back *to*, beyond loneliness and PTSD. I mean, assuming that Anneke's even still interested at this point.""

""Well, you're not wrong about me thinking that eighteen is still too young for a forty-five year old. But yeah, I'd say she's still interested. She thinks she's in love with you. So don't be an asshole.""

""Ouch,"" I winced. ""Ok. Ok. I'll figure something out. Thanks, Ivy. I really owe you one for this.""

""And you better believe I'll collect.""

""I have no doubts.""

### Phase Five: Rebellion
#### First Contact [FC] + 1 week

You could pretty much count on it.  Russia has opposed America at nearly every turn.  About the only time we really cooperated was WWII, and that was mostly because the Nazis were stupid enough to open two fronts.

""Premier, I do not give one shit, much less two what you *think* you can do.  If you attempt to launch those missiles, you will only succeed in killing your own people.""

Talk about paranoid!  A Russian/Communist Apparatchik outdoes everyone; even worse when he has to grandstand for his cabinet.  I already told him that the U.S. wasn't in charge.

""Look, if you're that dead set on launching unless something that was never going to happen doesn't happen, then do a test launch.  Pick some missile in the middle of nowhere, check that the fallout isn't going to land on anyone.  And launch it.  Just one thing… if anyone &amp;mdash; ANYONE &amp;mdash; other than your soldiers die in this attempt, you will be dead within 24 hours.  You have my *PERSONAL* word on that.  Not the U.S.  Not NATO.  Not any of the traditional allies.  Just me, and I will execute sentence myself.""

Good Lord.  You'd think I'd threatened to invade with every opponent they've ever had.

""Premier…  *PREMIER…*  **PREMIER…**  ***SHUT THE HELL UP YOU GRANDSTANDING ASS!***

""Thank you.  Now, I said *nothing* about armies.  The only person that's going to cross your borders to kill you is *me*.""

At least he's chuckling instead of screaming.  Ah, here comes the boasting—the threats against my family.  The unveiled references to the inferior American Forces.

""Premier?  Are you done playing for your audience?""

What audience... Sheesh.  Even the regular intelligence forces could figure that out.  Any competent negotiator would *know* they were there.  I can go a little further.

""Premier, without any outside aid, I can detect no less than twelve heartbeats in that room with you.  At least two of which are about ready to die of apoplexy.  Why don't you have a quick confab with them while I get my traveling clothes on.""

Why would I be traveling?  SO I CAN KILL YOU!

""Because I *know* you're going to push the button, you *won't* make sure no one else dies, and I'll have to be wherever you've moved to within 24 hours of the detonation.  Now, you go have that confab, settle who will be the next premier, and push your button.""

Ho, big argument in the background.  Hey!  That sounds like Smirnov!  He made General!?  Good for him!

""Hey, Fat Head, put Smirnov on; we can catch up with each other while the rest of you argue.  Don't bother asking why; you wouldn't understand.""

At least he's being reasonable about this.

""Thanks.""

""Well, General Hargrave, you have made quite a splash.  Is it true you shouted down the entire cabinet and the President?""

""No, State and Defense were both already on my side of the argument.  How have you been?  I hadn't talked with you since that exchange program when we were lieutenants.""

""Married, Irena, five kids, two in advanced degrees, one in military, two who disappeared.  I get notes now and again.  If I have the chance, I would like to introduce them to you myself.""

Calmly, softly, because I know how much this will mean to him, and how likely he is to not survive the coming purge.  He's too reasonable for the psychotics currently in charge.  ""Drago Ivan, would you like to speak to them now?  I'm pretty sure what the Premier is going to order.  This may be your last chance.""

""My friend... Blessings upon you for ten thousand years.  HOW?""

""I see you already know.  They knew you were highly placed, and they figured the Premier would get stupid, so they came to the White House.  I got them vetted and admitted.  They're on a separate line in the company of a U.S. Marshall.  Here are your children.""

I tune out the conversation.  They deserve some privacy.  I can do that without missing the argument in the background.

Long argument.

Ah.  They're settling on Grigor Sephanovich.  Bad choice, ultranationalist, sociopath, maybe even psychopath.

Aw, shit.  How stupid can you be?  Not that I didn't expect it, but there's not a damned thing I can do.  Except...

""Sorry to break in on this, but you need to say goodbye now.

""Marshall, take those kids into the Witness Protection Program.  Effective immediately.""

And snip that connection.

""Thank you, Leo.  I heard the order too.""

""Any chance I could *&lt;Crack!&gt;* … I guess not.  Premier, are you there?""

""So what you think about *that* American Puppet!""

""Say goodbye to your family; within 6 hours, you will be dead.  If any — *any* — of General Smirnov's family are harmed in the slightest, your entire family, from your great paternal grandfather down, will all die within the following 18 hours.  Right down to the babes in the womb.""

""You are American. You would never do that.""

""Premier, I was born American.  I was raised American.  I was trained American.  I am now your worst nightmare come true.  A *former* American, now in charge of the entire world — Me.  *Personally*.  Not the U.S. or any other organization. — who has the *power* and the *will* to do precisely what he says, and *no one* can stop me.

""Do you have any idea why our new neighbors chose me?""

""They like America.""

""No, Premier.  They do not care about America.  They care about the Human Race.  They chose me because I am as apolitical as it is possible for anyone to be.

""Without the strong man central government, it is possible that humans *could* work out a form of Communism that would be viable.  Unfortunately, your country has gone so far down the command economy, totalitarian government, and outright kleptocracy that the common man thinks of democracy as something that will only work if a strong man takes over at the top and *forces* it on everyone from the top down.

""That might work in a small island country.  It will never work in Russia.  The idea that the people force democracy by *making* their leaders toe the line never occurs to them.""

""I'm not going to enjoy killing all those otherwise innocent people.  In fact, I'll probably be crying the entire time. But I will do it.  Do you have the slightest idea why?""

""You hate me?""

""No, I don't hate you.  I pity you.  You could have been a far stronger leader if you hadn't been raised in a warring snake pit.""

""Then, why?""

""Because it will keep me from having to do it to anyone else.  That's all.  To strike a lesson of terror so deep into every two-bit dictator that I will never be called upon to administer another lesson on acceptable behavior.""

""As long as I remain Premier, I will never touch his family.  What happens after that, I cannot control.""

""Understood, Premier.  The debt will fall on whoever gives the order once you are dead.""

""Thank you for that.  Now, because I am pressed from this end, we have selected a  missile.  I am giving the order now.  The order is given.

""Do you think we will have time to talk when you reach me?""

He sounds wistful.  I think he knows they're going to kill him.  Of course he does, he's been in that snakepit for so long he couldn't *not* know it.  Damn.

""If I can, I will.  You deserve to understand what I am doing and why.""

""I have report of air-burst nuclear explosion at coordinates of launcher.  Limited fallout will drift on the wind as expected.  No one should be in the lethal zone, and troops are moving to establish cordon.

""If you do not mind my asking, how did you do that?""

Simple curiosity, not that I blame him but...

""My apologies, Premier, that must remain secret for a long time.""

""Very well, I have orders to give, and troop movement status to check.  Would you mind?""

""Not at all.  I will be waiting on this line, no matter where I will be in the world.""

They're going to kill him.  He knows it.  I know it.  I wonder what orders he's going to give?

""Hargrave?  We shall not meet in person. My replacement has already been elevated.  Goodbye, Gen *&lt;Crack!&gt;*…""

Damn.  I was starting to like him, too.  Wonder who they got to replace him?

*&lt;click&gt;*

Not a very talkative sort... *sigh*  time to call the man who still thinks he's my boss.

""Mr. President...""

""WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO!  THE RUSSIANS ARE GOING ALL OUT!""

""Mr. President…""

""YOU'RE FIRED!  YOU HAVE NO FURTHER AUTHORITY!  I'LL HAVE YOU SHOT!""

""PIPE DOWN, YOU POMPOUS COWARD! YOU CAN NOT EXECUTE ME!  WE ALREADY SETTLED THAT.  NOW YOU SHUT UP AND LISTEN OR I'LL BE SPEAKING WITH THE VICE PRESIDENT!""

*&lt;silence&gt;*

""Thank you, Mr. President.  The U.S. is in no immediate danger from the Russian launch.  None of those missiles will leave their airspace.  I need you to do several things.

""First, activate Glowworm Tango Ringo.""

Russia is about to need serious aid, Glowworm Tango is precisely about that process.  It was *intended* as a way to get aid to them in the event of a more devastating Chernobl incident.  When the Pentagon got ahold of it, they did what they ususally do, and that's always a good thing.  They took the basic idea and ran with it.  The Tango Ringo variant is a *what's the worst that could happen* scenario.  That's what is about to happen to them.

""Second, warn our western seaboard to expect radioactive fallout within the next week, with that fallout spreading from the west to the east in ever-decreasing amounts.  The Glowworm Tango Alpha plan should deal with it.""

The fallout should be minimal, but why take the chance.  Children will need those iodide tablets to keep them from absorbing it into their bones.  Any number of Tango scenarios lead to fallout on the western coast in varing degrees.

""Third, prepare a statement regarding the unfortunate death of Vladimir Garkiov, at the hands of his second in command, who ordered the attempted launch of their nuclear arsenal.""

I'll have to make sure that the President gets the full details on that.  Who am I kidding, he has a recording, I just need to fill in the context that the recording doesn't cover.

""Warn all countries that any attempted launch or deployment of nuclear weapons will trigger detonation immediately.  If they have any doubts, just point them at Russia and ask *them* what happened when *they* tried.""

Make *something* good come from this.  I hope.

""Fourth, prepare a statement regarding Grigor Sephanovich's sudden death.  That will happen in the next six hours.""

He's got that coming, and he'll probably been stupid enough to hurt Smirnov's family.

""Where will you be?'

""Moscow, and certain other points in the USSR.  I have debts to pay, and a debtor to dun for his butcher's bill.""

""General, are you speaking of General Smirnov's family?  The Berlin US Embassy reported the delivery of the extended families of Smirnov and Garkiov.  Some 50 individuals of various ages.  The men delivering them said it was on the orders of the Premier.  I assume they meant Vladimir.""

""Damn.""

""General?""

""He found time to do that when he *knew* they were going to kill him.  What's more, he had that planned and in movement long before today!  What a waste.""

""I see.  He exhibited redeeming qualities at the end?""

""Yes.""

""I think I'm beginning to understand.  You are no longer under my command.  If anything, I am your chief of staff.""

""And how did you come by that notion?""

""Something that Secretary of Defense Patton said, just before he resigned.  *If you survive to the end of your term, it will be because you finally recognize the fundamental shift in power General Hargrave represents.*""

""Did he give a reason for his resignation?""

""That you would have a desperate need for friends.  He felt he could do that job better if he were not in a political position that might drive him into direct opposition with you.""

""Lord bless and keep him.""

""For ten thousand years.""

""Yes.""

I was fortunate beyond belief.  No one, not even the terrorists across the world, tested me on weapons of mass destruction.  There were plenty of other things, but not CBN.

The next big problem was kleptocracy.  The people cannot better themselves if there is no method for economic improvement.  That was more a case of going from country to country, throwing out the thieves, after stripping them of everything they'd stolen.  There was terrible upheaval, war, civil war, unrest, crime, all the terrible things that happen when you (a) destroy a government, (b) a sudden influx of cash to the people, and (c) inform everyone that it is *their* problem to straighten out.

What did I tell you about democracy?  Only happens if *the people* make it happen.

Of course, none of this was in accordance with the plans provided by the Federation.",/r/HFY/comments/ka7t0k/invade_your_planet_part_five_rebellion/,4
43,kbecz8,HFY,Sat Dec 12 01:52:13 2020,American Isekai,"“I’m fine...I’m fine I can drive” he said in a slurred voice obviously in no condition to drive. Nick stumbled out of the door listening to the cheers behind him. The dorm was running low and needed more variation for the jungle juice to be a proper jungle juice. The cooler wasn’t even half full and as the least drunk person at the party, he was designated to go get more of whatever the fuck he could find at the Safeway. Listening to the music he pumped his fist a little. Then flipping through his key ring began to walk across the street to his car.

The problem is, is that Nick never looked, so he never saw the Isuzu NKR mini truck barreling toward him, why this truck you might ask? Because well fuck it, it’s not an isekai if that’s not what you get hit by, no one ever heard an isekai starting by getting hit by fucking Volvo, that’s even more humiliating. So anyway as the truck came barreling toward Nick he looked up just in time to watch as the front end of the truck snapped his legs in half, slamming his face into the windshield.

Maybe it was the alcohol but it didn’t hurt nearly as bad... as it could have. However, Nick, unlike the Isuzu NKR mini truck, was damaged, completely. Several broken ribs, his legs? No one knows maybe they ended up in the storm drain. The driver slammed on their breaks and Nick hitting the pavement finally died.

Opening his eyes Nick found himself in an empty space, and across from him sitting at a table was a woman.

“Where am I?”

“This is the afterlife...” she said speaking in a soft voice. Then introduced herself as the goddess Sylvia.

Nick stared at her then his eyes went wide, mostly because of the shock of remembering getting hit by the truck “this isn’t Safeway?” he said somehow still inebriated.

“What? No, I just told you this is the afterlife.” Nick looked at her slightly confused, “you asked the question before,” she responded somewhat annoyed.

“Ohhhhhhhhh… so this isn’t Safeway” 

She cleared her throat trying to keep her composure “No… look because you died relatively young you will be sent to another world.”

Nick stared at her blankly “do you have a drink isle here?”

Just hearing him she began to rub her temples, “I don’t get paid enough for this…” she whispered to herself. “Look when you get down there you’ll have the power to defeat the demon lord, we’re running low on heroes, and although it pains me to send you, it doesn’t matter at this point.”

Nick responded “ooh this is like some isekai type shit”

She looked at him pursing her lips, then she touched her index finger to his forehead. Nick becoming instantly sober finally regained his senses but not quite remembering the conversation they just had.

“Where am I?”

Sylvia made a face at him “WHAT ARE YOU RETARDED?!”

Nick unsure of what was going on began to answer as best he could “uhh, I’m sorry, I don’t... maybe? I don’t know, I don’t even know what’s going on! Why are you yelling at me?”

She looked at him realizing what happened. She took a deep breath and then spoke “I apologize as I forget that you humans tend to lose track of your memories when becoming sober.”

“Uhh sure... no it’s good I just kinda... have no clue what’s going on and you started yelling.”

Sylvia drew herself up to her original stature “this is the afterlife Nick, and sadly you ended up passing away”

Nick now in a more stable mindset knitted his eyebrows “ok…”

“You seem calmer than I expected”

Nick sat back in the chair “I guess… but to an extent, I was expecting it”

“Oh, and why is that?” she already knew but still asked him.

“Well, I guess we all die eventually ” this wasn’t at all what she was expecting she thought that it was him slightly remembering the conversation from just a minute ago, or the fact that he was a closet weeaboo.

It slightly disturbed her that he was actually logical when sober. She continued to speak “do you know why I brought you here?”

Nick thought about it, “Well, I know that I died, but no.”

Sylvia began her speech which she had originally planned until it was ruined by his drunkenness. “ We’ve been having a shortage of heroes among the magical worlds and as far as my precinct goes there’s been a delay in the Japanese souls’ shipment.”

“Wait why Japan?” 

“Because it provides good content for entertainment, and once it happens somewhere in the multiverse then it can be imagined by writers and illustrators. But mostly it’s the fact that we try to give the heroes something familiar, and with Japan’s diversity in games, it makes it easy to assimilate them into their new world. This being the main reason why we use Japanese souls so often.” Sylvia continued her explanation“ They’re all just souls, but it’s the life they lived and their character that makes them interesting.”

“How so?”

“There have been times where they woo the demon lord other times they make friends, they’re overall interesting”

“But you don’t just use Japanese though?” 

“No, one time this precinct received a Finnish sniper, who after learning about his need to kill the regional demon lord walked for three days straight and surprised all of his high generals by putting a bullet through his skull by the time they even learned that he had been summoned.”

“So do you do it all for entertainment?”

“No, on a realistic level, it needs to be done either way for more advanced worlds like your own to exist. It’s just better when the people are kind-hearted and the demon lord doesn’t actually need to be killed.”

“Wait so earth was like that?”

“Oh yeah, every reality is like that, it’s just that when it happened in yours, the first one weirdly enough died of dysentery as a male sex slave… during some territorial disputes sometime before the paleolithic period, which effectively ended all future generations of demon lords. Because of that, there was never any reason to send a hero… it’s also part of the reason your world never had any need for magic”

“I was expecting you to say it was Hitler,” Nick said, a little surprised.

Sylvia looked at him “no he was just a regular human being, we looked into it briefly but there was no correlation” she said as she pulled a book from under her robes, flipping through she began to speak, “alright then so since a majority of these worlds are generic fantasy worlds they’re not quite as specific as fantasy games you have in the US.” Nick nodded “ok so here we have... surprisingly few?” she bit her lip a little “Do you play Dark Souls?”

“No, mostly Call Of Duty”

“For Honour?”

“No”

“Diablo?”

“Mmm no”

“Skyrim?”

“Just a little bit at a friends house”

“Ok last one, Fable?”

“Fable… Fable?.... Sounds familiar”

She began to speak to herself “mmm that’s really pushing it, but it’ll have to work.” she looked up speaking to Nick “The world works off of your basic leveling system like in most games, it’s not like any of the games you play but hopefully you’ll get the basic premise of leveling and so forth.” Sylvia looked at him “we don’t really do this but since you’re at a disadvantage, I’m doing it.” she touched her finger to his forehead once again allowing Nick to remember his past life. Specifically, the portions relating to the years of anime he watched in secret, for the simple fact that she needed him to understand the type of world he would be living in.

This didn’t quite give her the result she was looking for “Why was there an Isuzu NKR mini truck there? You never see those in America.”

She grimaced, “Actually that was the shipment of Japanese souls, and that’s why it got delayed. So yours arrived here first…”

Nick began to press her for more answers, and although it was a lie and he was not sent for yet she made an excuse “uhh... oh no the ritual is starting.” she said using her foot to tip the chair.

“Wh.. wai... what” Nick stammered falling out and dropping into the empty space.

Sylvia sat there a little then standing up, walked around the table to pick up the chair. She clicked her tongue a little “wait………… ”she stared down into the space, “eh never mind……….. He’ll figure it out...”

Nick as a matter of fact figured it out very fast he was not summoned yet, but did see the beam of light shoot up from under him from the church he was supposed to be awakened in. As is natural for anyone falling at terminal velocity to their death, he began to scream making a large majority of the small town of Prostate aware that something was happening. The priests performing the ritual stared at the circle they had drawn on the altar awaiting the hero’s arrival.

Nick in his just formed full set of armor came first crashing through the roof and secondly into the rafters slamming his head into a support beam, he flipped over in the air hitting a lower one and his body hung there a bit before sliding off and falling all the way to the ground landing in the circle where his possibly dead body was illuminated by the sunlight streaming through the hole. The priests stared in shock not really sure if this was how he was supposed to arrive. Sure they summoned him and he came from the heavens as the book said, it just seemed a little unorthodox. 

“This is the hero right?” one of them asked

“I think so…”

Another who was holding the book and directing the ritual began to read “The hero of the land will descend from the heavens making his way down slowly before being laid to rest in the circle he will be enveloped by light when he arrives and in a days time will awaken, just as the heroes of old, all will know of his arrival.”

One of them looked at the limp body that lay in the middle of the church. Scratching his head he began to speak “The scripture is accurate it’s just… it’s… I don’t know, I don’t know... I just... feel like we were lied to a little bit…”

One of them began to approach the body “I think we should help him at least.”

The priest holding the book screeched “NO THE HOLY SCRIPTURE DOES NOT SAY TO TOUCH HIM!”

The residents of the town of Prostate most of whom were curious about the screaming had made their way to the church. Pushing their way in they began to congregate around the body

“Someones’ been killed!”

“Who is it”

“Tha us uh moighty fine se O’ amor he’s goh thah”

“No now’s not the time”

“Wha I wus jus sayin tha tha us uh moighty fine se O’ amor he’s goh thah”

“Stop someones been-”

“No he’s got a point that is a fine set of armor”

“Again who is it?”

The priest who was holding the book looked up, it seemed that he had been waiting to give the speech on such an occasion. Despite the situation he began to speak in a completely serious tone “Today is a special occasion, brothers and sisters. We stand here today to celebrate the arrival of this hero.” he said motioning to the limp and motionless body that lay on the ground next to him, “our mother goddess Sylvia has granted them to us as a gracious gift to fight off the demons that we have so long struggled against.” he paused but before he could speak again the townspeople started to talk instead.

“Do you think we angered her…I mean look at him...”

“Tha us uh moighty fine se-”

“Dammit we heard you the first time, stop”

“Olrighee then”

“That’s not even a hero that’s just a dead body”

One of the other priests raised his hands “everyone please settle down… we had our disbeliefs too, but the scripture has not lied to us, everything that has been written has been accurate. Although unorthodox it has not been wrong.”

“Do you expect us to believe that this corpse is supposed to save us!”

One of the people spoke up “oi fah one belihev tha this es thah hero, ass I set befo tha us uh moighty fine se O’ amor he’s goh thah”

“We get that but-”

“Nuh louk ah eh! Iss cleahle beah than thah res oive seen… if he came fro’m thah hevans thah is’nt a scrotch on it!”

“Ok I get your point but can you please stop talking like that!”

“Es thah doorf In mah, I cahn’t”

“We all know damn well you can… you haven’t had a dwarf in your family for twelve generations,  you fucking dipshit, guess what your father, grandfather, even your great grandfather never talked like that!”

“Whai whai when di this tun tuh ull uf yah attackin meh, we shou beh foucusin un thuh hero”

The priest with the book called for silence “I believe he is right the armor has not a single dent in it, no human armor could have survived that”

Technically, he was right, but what they didn’t realize was that although the armor was strong and built in the fashion of the gods, gravity itself was stronger and like all medieval armor, it was still susceptible to blunt-force. So they didn’t see the tiny cracks that perforated the entire suit. Nick still inside was saved due to the god-like protection, but sadly enough slamming your face with a force of 1061.7N into one of the very few foot thick newly added rafters that was supported from the bottom by a vertical post and connected by a lap joint for extra stability was still bound to injure a person. 

If not for the armor Nick would have been dead instantly but instead got away with only a few broken ribs, a coma as well as a surprisingly minor concussion from blunt force trauma, and the ability to speak the foreign language while he was unconsciously listening to them speak, which Sylvia forgot to do beforehand, as well as a numerous amount of side effects most of which didn’t do much. The list was fairly long but one of the most notable included a memory of him eating Playdough, as well as its exact flavor. Which statistically should be impossible due to the variation in Playdough flavor between each container and reality, however, this alone made him one of the most valuable things in the universe… that is if anyone cared to know just how absolutely vast the flavor of disappointment was.",/r/HFY/comments/kbecz8/american_isekai/,52
46,kblwir,HFY,Sat Dec 12 10:47:46 2020,"Retreat, Hell - Episode 14","A/N: Well, this took longer to hammer out than any of us would have liked. I also ended up having to split it into 2 episodes, because there was too much plot-building going on to fit in one episode (at 12,419 words, it's not the longest episode ever, but it's long enough). That means that the excitement of Episode 15 (now Episode 16)'s trip to a keshmin town will have to wait a little bit longer, and the new Episode 15 will take a bit longer to hammer out, but this works out a lot better for plotting and pacing than what I was originally planning.  


Today's episode continues with the artificer integration pilot program, and lays the ground work for a number of events that will happen in Episodes 15 and 16. Episode 17 will wrap up Act III, running through the aftermath and fallout of some things that will happen in the next couple of episodes, and then we'll be on to Act IV, and going back on the offensive against the elves. Acts IV and V will be heavy on the action, and we'll also be taking a few side-jaunts to get a broader perspective on the war beyond Second Squad.

&amp;#x200B;

“Forward, at a double-time, march!” The familiar sound of feet hitting the ground in time mostly covered the muttered grumbles and complaints in the pre-dawn light.

&amp;#x200B;

“Here we go again!”

&amp;#x200B;

“HERE WE GO AGAIN!”

&amp;#x200B;

“Same old song again!”

&amp;#x200B;

“SAME OLD SONG AGAIN!”

&amp;#x200B;

*Do they ever just… not run?!* Rinn thought to himself as he jogged along in formation with Echo Company. The other keshmin were distributed amongst their assigned squads for the battalion’s formation run. *Their cadences are actually kinda fun, but the running spoils it…*

&amp;#x200B;

He panted hard as they stormed around the base. Rapid construction was happening everywhere. An unending stream of troops, equipment, and supplies poured through the portal in mind-boggling quantities, at an unbelievable pace. They ran past cleared and flattened lots that had been stands of trees the day before. Previously cleared lots had new tents or buildings popping up overnight, or were being filled with lines of vehicles or rows upon rows of supplies stacked on wooden pallets.

&amp;#x200B;

Human aircraft rumbled overhead as they circled back to the older buildings they had constructed the week before. His ears perked up when he realized where they were, and his tail twitched in excited relief when their barracks came into view, bathed in the light of the Earth sun just starting to crest the horizon on the other side of the portal.

&amp;#x200B;

*We’re almost done!* He thought, his tongue lolling a bit as he smiled. *Maybe I won’t die today, after all!* 

&amp;#x200B;

He grinned when they rounded the last corner, and faltered as they passed in front of their barracks without slowing. *What!? No! Where- Where are we going!?* The head of the column made a turn, heading down a road that lead away from the end point of their run. *Why?! Why are they doing this?!* He whined, glancing over his shoulder at their retreating barracks.

&amp;#x200B;

The Marine behind him chuckled. “Head down and drive on, Devil Dog!”

&amp;#x200B;

Ears drooping, Rinn faced front and drove on.

&amp;#x200B;

Too more rounds past the barracks and the Marines were called to a halt. “Artificers! Fall out!” Barakis shouted, making sure the order was passed down the line. “Medical says that’s all you get to run in a day!”

&amp;#x200B;

Rinn stumbled out of formation, tongue lolling as he resisted the urge to fall to the ground, even as some of his compatriots did just that.

&amp;#x200B;

“Recover, clean yourselves up, and be in Conference Hall 8 by oh-eight-hundred.” 

&amp;#x200B;

Rinn nodded alongside Duke Yeshai, the only other keshmin still standing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Barakis turned back to the humans. “Marines! We’ve still got a run to finish! First Sergeants, get ‘em moving!”

&amp;#x200B;

A series of groans and shouted orders later, and the battalion stormed away in a cloud of dust.

&amp;#x200B;

Yeshai panted as he watched them go, his ears drooping in exhaustion. “They run a forced march every day…” he shook his head, then with a visible exertion of will, he lifted his ears and turned to his countrymen. “Let’s get them up. We have an important conference today.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Yes, your grace,” Rinn yipped around his own pants. He was too tired to lift his own ears past a worn-out sag.

&amp;#x200B;

Fortunately, the humans had not left them completely alone. A pair of corpsmen moved about the stricken keshmin, distributing chilled bottles of colored, flavored water and taking vitals. Satisfied that they weren’t about to die from exhaustion, despite the keshmins’ own certainty on the matter, the corpsmen helped them to their feet. Whining and groaning as their muscles started to stiffen, they hobbled into their respective barracks.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“Man, there’s more stars in here than… one of them astrology… onomy… stargazy things…” Kawalski muttered, leaning back in his chair to get a little bit further away from the brass gathering in the room.

&amp;#x200B;

“Observatory, brah.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Yeah, that.”

&amp;#x200B;

Bradford shook her head. “Stick with what you know, Kawalski, and keep your goddamn mouth shut.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Yes, mom.’

&amp;#x200B;

“Fuck you, Kawalski,” she whispered.

&amp;#x200B;

“Yes, mom.”

&amp;#x200B;

She glared at him, but knew that was a battle she couldn’t win. Instead, she said nothing and settled into her chair. 

&amp;#x200B;

Conference Hall Eight was basically just an empty prefab with a bunch of classroom-style desk/chair combos arranged in a rough circle around the center of the room. *Judging by the battered condition of some of these things, and the fact that most of them have old chewing gum stuck all over the bottoms of them, they were probably hauled in from some local school…*

&amp;#x200B;

“Dude, General Langstrom just walked in with more stars in tow than a summer blockbuster…” Kimber muttered. “Why the fuck are we here?!”

&amp;#x200B;

“Do we have everyone?” Langstrom asked an aide, receiving a nod in return. “Alright, everyone,” he spoke up, his voice carrying across the room. “Let’s get started.” He glanced around at the people dispersed across the dense cluster of desks and scoffed. “You know, when I asked my staff to get this type of chair for this meeting, I told them to get as many as they could get their hands on.” He shook his head. “They went and got me way more than I needed.” His mouth twisted in a sardonic grin. “Figures, the stuff we don’t need to win a war, we have in spades, but anything you need to fight and win, nowhere to be found!” He threw his hands up with a short bark of a laugh, eliciting a chuckle from around the room.

&amp;#x200B;

He waved his hands towards where he stood in the center of the circle. “Bring it in and tighten up, so we don’t have to shout across the room.”

&amp;#x200B;

A flurry of screeches and scrapes followed as several people shifted to new desks, and a few opted to scoot their current seats to new positions.

&amp;#x200B;

Bradford exchanged glances with her squadmates as the keshmin nobles moved closer to the front. They all opted to stay put in their chairs, along one of the walls. So did the enlisted keshmin.

&amp;#x200B;

“Alright,” he said once everyone had settled, his voice carrying across the room at nearly the same volume. “There are too many of us here to waste time going around the room introducing ourselves, and frankly, right now, I don’t care.” He looked about the room, his hands on his hips, eyeballing senior officers and NCOs of every branch in the US military.

&amp;#x200B;

“This is as much a spit-balling session as anything else, and I don’t care who you are, if you’ve got good ideas or inputs, I want to hear them.” He started pacing back and forth in the small, open area at the center of the circle, like a caged panther.

&amp;#x200B;

He’s not one who can sit idle for very long, Bradford noted.

&amp;#x200B;

“We now have solid data on the capabilities of our elven enemies, and the capabilities of the regular troops, artillery, and artificers of the Ganlin Royal Host.” He held up a hand, counting off on his fingers. “Our objectives with this meeting are to use that information to identify elven capabilities that we are particularly vulnerable to, ways to counter them, elven vulnerabilities that we can exploit, ways in which we can integrate artificer capabilities to benefit our units and doctrine, and how best to utilize the existing regular troops of the Royal Host.” 

&amp;#x200B;

He turned, pacing back to the other side of his cleared area. “I am primarily interested in tactics, strategies, and policies we can enact in the immediate future, and over the short to mid-term. I am more concerned with what we can do *now*, than with what we might be able to do six months to a year from now,” he pointed at the deck, then waved at the bulkhead to emphasize his point, then then brought both hands over to point at something next to his left hip. “Though we still need to leave ourselves room to maneuver when we get to that point.” He looked about the room, half sitting on the corner of an empty desk and opening his arms to the crowd. “So, what have we got?”

&amp;#x200B;

A two-star Army General leaned forward. “What is the benefit of integration is in the first place? Is there even a utility here? How can troops armed with pikes and glorified catapults support us at all?”

&amp;#x200B;

“We can train them and equip them with modern weapons and equipment, like we did in Iraq and Afghanistan,” another General spoke up. “They won’t compare to our regular forces, but even with rudimentary training and basic equipment, the twenty thousand troops they managed to hang on to can make a good holding and rear-guard force. Putting them to that use is already the plan for Operation Bulldog.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Isn’t their army scattered all over the place, with lots of wounded?” a full-bird asked.

&amp;#x200B;

“Less wounded than you would think,” the second General said. “Seems like most got cut down on the field or ran away, not much in-between. The couple thousand they do have too wounded to fight didn’t get past their camp. They’ve got over twenty thousand troops in camp now, and a report I saw this morning said they think they have another ten thousand to fifteen thousand on top of that scattered about they can muster back up, and that doesn’t even count the rest of their army stationed elsewhere, or other troops they’re trying to raise.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Thirty thousand organized, veteran troops is a helluva lot more than we started with in Iraq,” an Army sergeant major said. “And they can’t need any more instruction on firearms than some of the Iraqis did,” he added, earning a few chuckles from around the room.

&amp;#x200B;

“Probably want to go with M16s and M4s over AKs,” an Air Force Lieutenant Colonel said. “We’ve got plenty of ‘em, and it simplifies logistics.” He received several nods and murmurs of agreement.

&amp;#x200B;

“TRADOC’s just up the street,” an Air Force general said. “We could start shipping them up there for training.”

&amp;#x200B;

“So we equip their army with guns so they can hold the rear, and hold the country when the war’s over and we pull out,” the first two-star said. “They’ll still need transport to keep up, so either we truck ‘em around, or we also give ‘em trucks and teach ‘em how to drive. That’s a lot of giving on our part, as well as carrying the bulk of the war effort. What do we get in return?”

&amp;#x200B;

“That’s more a question for the politicians, Stan, don’t you think?” a Navy two-star asked.

&amp;#x200B;

“It’s logistics,” General ‘Stan’ grunted back. “And basic cost-benefit analysis.”

“And a question we have to factor in,” Langstrom said, standing up and turning to Yeshai. “Much as I hate giving politicians a say in tactical and strategic planning, they get a vote on this one. If we’re going to equip your troops with our weapons, we’re going to have to give the politicians something to justify the expense. Beyond winning the war.”

&amp;#x200B;

“I am not empowered to negotiate such trade deals,” Yeshai said, pausing as one of Langstrom’s aides translated for most of the room. “But I am sure there is a lot of knowledge and resources that the Kingdom can provide for such an exchange.”

&amp;#x200B;

“We’ll leave the negotiations to the politicians,” Langstrom said. “But that should be enough of a bone to throw to them. They’re already salivating over trade deals for magic and resources.”

&amp;#x200B;

“I’m more interested in what their artificers can do with our units,” a three-star Marine said. He looked familiar, and as he turned in his seat to face the keshmin, Bradford recognized him from various chain-of-command photo trees. *That’s Lieutenant General Ekhart, the CO of the entire I Marine Expeditionary!* “Those shields they can put up are pretty damned impressive, and the report I read from the battle at Backstreet One had a single artificer deflecting heavy artillery from one of their big towers. Put them in a Humvee or LAV, and they can shrug off fire like an Abrams.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Most of our artificers are not nearly as talented at shield casting as Second Artificer Ahyat,” Yeshai said, flicking an ear at Rinn, “But shielding your… *vehicles*,” he said, in heavily-accented English, “Is certainly within our artificers’ capabilities.”

&amp;#x200B;

“So that’s definitely something to pursue,” Langstrom said, nodding at one of his aides, who was already jotting down notes.

&amp;#x200B;

“We’ve already got armor that can stop their smallarms fire,” General “Stan” interjected. “A shield that can stop heavy artillery would be great, but if most of them can’t do it, is the training and effort to embed them in our units going to be worthwhile?” He shook his head. “They’ve got some neat tricks, I’ll grant you, but I don’t think the time and expense of training and equipping them will be worthwhile. We’d be better off putting that time and resources into putting more of our own troops into the fight, and attacking sooner.”

&amp;#x200B;

“He’s got a point,” an Air Force General said. “Integration takes time. The more time we focus on that as a strategy, the longer it takes us to go on the offensive. Operation Bulldog already has our forces spearheading the assault, once we get our logistics situation sorted. We’re losing enough time with that as it is, and we have no idea what kind of strategic depth of forces the elves really have. If we want to press ahead and keep them on the backfoot, we can’t afford to wait any longer than we absolutely have to before going on the offensive.”

&amp;#x200B;

Several heads nodded in agreement or at least understanding around the room. 

&amp;#x200B;

“Shields aren’t all they can do, sir,” Bradford said, surprised that she had spoken up, and immediately regretting it as all eyes in the room turned to her. She blanched as she came under the scrutiny of most of the command elements in the entire theater. 

&amp;#x200B;

“Speak up, Sergeant,” Langstrom said, the barest hint of an amused smile on the corner of his mouth. “I asked for you and your squad to be here for a reason.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Yes, sir,” she said, swallowing. Most of the looks she got were neutral, but a few were dismissive or critical. Her squad looked at her with a mix of reverence and horror. She cleared her throat. “One of the most immediate things they can do is disrupt the elven invisibility spells. We can see their blending on thermals, but we don’t have a counter for their true invisibility.”

&amp;#x200B;

“I was wondering when someone was going to bring that up,” Langstrom said. He glanced around the room. “The sergeant is right. The lab coats are all working hard on looking for a counter that we can deploy, but aside from our military working dogs, so far they’re all drawing up blanks.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Dogs will only be so much help on the battlefield,” a Navy Master Chief spoke up. “We put them to great use in Iraq and Afghanistan, and I owe my life to a few of them, but they’re not going to be of much help an Abrams crew, or an Apache in the air, and there’s only so much a dog can do in the chaos of the battlefield.”

&amp;#x200B;

“So we embed a few in each unit for invisibility detection to supplement our canine units,” General Stan said. “That’s still not a case for large-scale integration.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Respectfully, sir, that’s not even the most important thing.” All eyes turned to Bradford once more, some in particular carried a measure of hostility. She swallowed again. “Ahyat was invaluable because he knows how the elves fight. He knows what to expect from them. What they’re capable of. What tricks they pull, and how to counter them. He saved my entire battalion from an elven ambush, not just because he could disrupt their invisibility. That wouldn’t have meant a damn thing if he hadn’t realized why the elven mage towers had stopped firing on our position.” She took another breath. “We just got here, sir. They’ve been fighting the elves for seven years.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Sergeant Bradford’s right,” Colonel Michaels said, and she was immensely glad for his support. “We brought in technology and firepower the elves did not expect, and it gives us a distinct advantage, but we’ve had all of two whole engagements with them, and none of us know what we can expect the elves to do or bring to the field in response.” He nodded at Yeshai and the other keshmin nobles. “Except for them. Their knowledge and expertise is invaluable.”

&amp;#x200B;

“And their artificers can do more than just shields and anti-invisibility,” Major Volchok spoke up. “The range demonstration they put on last week was pretty damned impressive. Most shots don’t hit as hard as an M16, and they can’t compete at long range, but at typical engagement ranges, they work well enough against the targets we’ll be facing. They can also enhance our weapons and armor to be even more effective. A single artificer is more than just a shield or an intelligence asset. They are force multipliers.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Until they run out of ammo,” another Army General spoke up. “That’s been one of their army’s biggest problems, hasn’t it? Their supply of mana crystals?” He frowned, clearly still adjusting to saying those words in a serious context. “I know we captured a large stockpile from the elves in our last engagement, but we can’t rely on capturing enemy supplies. If the Ganlin army has trouble supplying their own forces, how are they going to be able to supply units embedded in our forces?”

&amp;#x200B;

“Could we make our own?” an Air Force Colonel asked. “Hook up a generator to some device that can convert electricity into mana?”

&amp;#x200B;

Rinn’s ears twitched, but Yeshai beat him to answering that question. “That is something that is possible in theory; we can convert mana into lightning, it should be possible to convert lightning back into mana, but none of our experiments have succeeded.” He paused. “Some of them ended rather famously in disaster.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Twenty years ago, one of the professors at Yagyhanae blew off the top of the southwestern tower in an experiment trying to convert a lightning bolt into mana,” Rinn whispered to Bradford. “Since then, those experiments have been forbidden on the campus grounds.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Our own eggheads are working on that. If that’s possible, it will lead to all manner of new technologies and weapons, but it’s not something we have now, or that we’re likely to have tomorrow.” Langstrom shook his head, and made the motion of crumpling something into a ball and tossing it away. “Let’s put that in the “future concerns” bucket, and add mana supply logistics to our near-future concerns.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Not an immediate thing to consider, but what about the possibility of magically-enhanced artillery shells?” One of the Army Generals spoke up. He was close enough that she could tell his unit insignia was for some kind of artillery regiment, though she couldn’t make out which specific unit.

&amp;#x200B;

The subject bounced around the room, with Yeshai and Ayan supplying some details on keshmin manufacturing capabilities, but was ultimately thrown into the future concerns bucket. The time for development, testing, and manufacture was outside the window Langstrom was interested in.

&amp;#x200B;

The conversation immediately jumped into the possibility of mounting keshmin direct-fire artillery on American armored vehicles. Volchok provided a detailed analysis, and noted that the potential was there, but that conventional US weaponry was more powerful at present. “If we could tap their guns into a generator and directly convert electrical energy into mana, however, they may well give the main gun on an Abrams a run for its money.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Another future concern, then,” Langstrom said.

&amp;#x200B;

“Yes,” Volchok nodded. “Though their current artillery shouldn’t be discounted. It doesn’t have the range of modern artillery, and our equivalents are better, but they would still be a threat on a modern battlefield. Against the elves, while I’d still prefer a US armor platoon, a Ganlin artillery battery can still be a lot of use, especially if combined with other modern equipment.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Noted,” Langstrom said. He turned to a three-star Army General. “Frank, sounds like a job for your boys to figure out.”

&amp;#x200B;

General Frank nodded. “I’ll get some men on it.”

&amp;#x200B;

“So, it sounds like the foundation of Operation Bulldog is still the best path we can take,” Langstrom said, after further discussion of logistics and regular army equipment options. “Two/Five will continue their training and study exercise with the keshmin artificers while we sort out our logistics nightmare. In the meantime, we’ll start standing up training programs for the regular Ganlin army. Should be pretty easy, we’ve got plenty of experts in that field from Iraq and Afghanistan. We’ll train them on M16s and standard US equipment, and start equipping them and pairing them up with mechanized Army Reserve units for transport once the politicians sort their shit out.”

&amp;#x200B;

He glanced at his watch and frowned. “I wish I had more time for this sort of shit, we’ll have to wrap it up here.” He stood up from the desktop he had been sitting on. “If anyone has any further inputs or concerns, forward them to my office.” He looked at General Ekhart. “Brad, I want your men to put together a detailed plan for augmentation of regular Marine and Army units with keshmin artificers, based on Two/Five’s efforts. It might not be fully implemented right away, but I want it ready to go ASAP.”

&amp;#x200B;

“I’ll have it on your desk by the end of the week,” Ekhart nodded. Bradford saw Michaels briefly frown before he repressed it. *Three guesses who will actually be writing that plan…*

&amp;#x200B;

“Also, Duke Yeshai,” Langstrom turned to the keshmin. “We’ve managed to capture an elven spy who slipped through the portal.”

&amp;#x200B;

All of the keshmins’ ears shot up, fixed on the general, along with most of the eyes in the room. “Alive?” Yeshai asked.

&amp;#x200B;

“Yes, alive,” Langstrom said. He grimaced. “He managed to kill a few people before we were able to catch him, but we captured him alive. Right now, we have him sedated so he can’t pull any magical suicide bullshit, but if your people have any advice or techniques for holding an elven prisoner, we would be more than happy to share any information we’re able to glean from him.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Yes, of course,” Yeshai said. “There are a few tonics that can suppress their magical abilities, or defocus the mind enough to make spell construction all but impossible. I will order a supply of them to be delivered immediately, and pen a letter to Lord General Yangri requesting further assistance at once.” 

&amp;#x200B;

“Outstanding!” Langstrom said. “I’ll send an aid over with additional details.” He glanced about the room. “Ladies and Gentlemen. Thanks for coming, thanks for your input. Let’s get to work!”

&amp;#x200B;

“Attention on deck!” called one of the more junior officers at the edge of the room.

&amp;#x200B;

“Carry on,” Langstrom said as he departed. 

&amp;#x200B;

With a sigh of relief, Bradford stood and stretched along with the rest of Second Squad while the brass started filing out of the room, though a few stopped to mingle and discuss various top brass matters.

&amp;#x200B;

“Thank the gods…” Tyehtyeh said, closing his eyes as he twisted his head from side to side, eliciting a few, barely-audible pops. “Above and below, I was right beside myself with boredom there. Least they could have done is liven things up with a bit of a tail show for us, eh, Yenyed?” he asked, elbowing the keshmin next to him.

&amp;#x200B;

Yenyed was not the keshmin next to him, however. Knight Captain Anyo sneered down his short snout, looking for all the world like a pointy-nosed cat who just got sprayed with water. “Second Artificer Tyehtyeh!” he snapped. “You are representing His Majesty’s Royal Host before an esteemed ally. You will comport yourself accordingly, is that understood?”

&amp;#x200B;

“Yes, m’lord!” Tyehtyeh said, snapping to attention. 

&amp;#x200B;

“Frankly, Second Artificer, your behavior and ribaldry have been markedly *unbecoming* of a member of the Royal Host. Do you understand this, *Second Artificer* Tyehtyeh?”

&amp;#x200B;

“Yes, m’lord, but, ah…” he broke from attention to scratch at the base of a horn, then briefly tugged at an ear. “Technically, I’m not a member of the Royal Host, you see… My Line were irregulars, and we never were officially integrated into the Host…”

&amp;#x200B;

Anyo flicked his ears in disgust. “Gods-damned *levies*.” He took a deep breath, his ears returning to their regular, regal sweep. “Well, *Second Artificer*, you are a part of the Royal Host *now*, and you will adjust your behavior to be more *appropriate*. Is that understood, Second Artificer?”

&amp;#x200B;

“Yes, m’lord!” Tyehtyeh said, snapping back to attention. “As you say, m’lord!”

&amp;#x200B;

The Knight Captain gave him a final, disgusted look, then turned away. “Good. Now get out of my sight.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Right away, m’lord!” Tyehtyeh said, giving him a crisp bow. He immediately made himself scarce.

&amp;#x200B;

The Marines all glanced at each other at the exchange, which had drawn a fair amount of attention from around the room. Kawalski whispered, his eyebrows high, his mouth puckered tight, “Mommy just slapped daddy at the *dinner table*.”

&amp;#x200B;

Bradford rolled her eyes. “C’mon, let’s get the fuck out of here before any of you fucks do something stupid, too.” 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“What are you working on?” Bradford asked. Sitting down on her cot next to Rinn, she began pulling her boots off.

&amp;#x200B;

He swung an ear to face her, but kept most of his attention on the fine notebook and ‘ballpoint pen’ he had been given. “It’s a marching song,” he said, pausing to gnaw on the end of the pen while he hummed a tune under his breath. “I’m trying to work out the words for it in English.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Oh?” she said, leaning over to eye this notes before digging in her pack. “Don’t let First Sergeant Khatri catch wind of it, he’ll make you sing it during a formation run.”

&amp;#x200B;

Rinn rolled an ear at her. “It helps me learn English, in case we lose our translation spell, and so you don’t always have to translate for me.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Oh, by all means, then,” she said, pulling out a stiff-bristled brush. “Don’t let me interrupt you!”

&amp;#x200B;

He flicked his ear in amusement, and jotted down a few more words.

&amp;#x200B;

“Barber shop’s open!” Kimber said, holding up a buzzing device he had just used to shave his head with Dubois’ help. “Deployment cuts are half-price!”

&amp;#x200B;

Rinn quirked an ear as most of the squad started lining up. Bradford looked up from the boot she was brushing, smirked, and went back to cleaning off the day’s grime.

&amp;#x200B;

Edison was first in line and Kimber threw a sheet around him once he sat down on an empty bucket. “What’s this all about?” Rinn asked, watching as Kimber expertly trimmed what little hair Edison had off.

&amp;#x200B;

“Old Marine Corps tradition,” Bradford said, inspecting her boot before setting it down next to its mate. She pulled her pack out from under her rack and dug out a heavy, hard-bound book. “New guys on their first deployment shave their head.” She flipped the book open on a small but sturdy-looking bookmark and settled back on her rack to read. “No idea where it comes from.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Oh,” Rinn said, watching in fascination as the next Marine sat down to have his hair shaved off, his notebook momentarily forgotten. He turned an ear back towards Bradford. “Do you have to shave your hair?”

&amp;#x200B;

“Already did it. Davies, Dubois, and I caught the last quarter or so of the last deployment in Afghanistan. Shaved my head the day I reported.” She flipped the page. “Kimber just missed it. He technically should have been there for the last two weeks of the deployment, but they held him stateside until the battalion came back over.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Oh,” he said, watching as more and more hair piled on the floor. For a brief moment, he imagined all his fur being shaved off, and shuddered in horror.

&amp;#x200B;

“Rub my head for luck, Jabs?!” Edison said, bouncing by with a towel and toiletries kit. He shoved his face in front of her book.

&amp;#x200B;

“Oh, fuck off!” she said, shoving him away before closing the book and taking a swing at him with it. 

&amp;#x200B;

“Ah! Help! She’s turning her knowledge into a weapon!” he danced away, but not before catching a glancing blow.

&amp;#x200B;

“Gah!” he said, falling to the ground dramatically. “Foiled by thermodynamics once again!”

&amp;#x200B;

“Go fucking shower!” she laughed, rolling back over and re-opening her book.

&amp;#x200B;

“Yes, mooom!”

&amp;#x200B;

She sighed, pointedly ignoring him as he bounced back to his feet and sauntered into the head.

&amp;#x200B;

Rinn tittered a laugh, earning him an amused glare from Bradford. 

&amp;#x200B;

“Bald head train!” Sampson called out, parading around the room with Stephens and Gomez following close behind, each holding the hips of the man in front of him. They were all stripped to their t-shirts and boxers, and Gomez was shirtless. “Chug-chug-chug-chug, Choo! Choo!” Samspon called out as the Marines bobbed their heads up and down in alternating rhythm. “Chug-chug-chug-chug, Choo! Choo!”

&amp;#x200B;

His barbering work done, Kimber threw the sheet over his head, putting on an extra deep voice. “And now I have become every man’s *worst nightmare*…” He popped his head out of the sheet, keeping it tucked around his neck, switching to a high-pitched, nasally voice. “I’m a broken condom! Heheheheheheh!”

&amp;#x200B;

“Goddamnit,” Bradford sighed, closing her book and sitting up to put it away. She stuffed it back into her bag, but Rinn could tell she was using the action to cover up a smile and silent laughter.

&amp;#x200B;

“Are all humans this crazy?” he asked, his ears back, as Gomez slowly took an exaggerated power stance in front of Kawalski, spitting out words that didn’t translate.

&amp;#x200B;

“Nah, just the men,” she said. “Us women are perfectly, one-hundred-percent stable and sane. Always.”

&amp;#x200B;

Rinn swung an ear towards her, cocked at a low angle, broadcasting his absolute disbelief.

&amp;#x200B;

“Don’t you point your ear at me like that,” she said, chuckling.

&amp;#x200B;

“Ohhh, KOWABUNGA!” Gomez shouted before jump-tackling Kawalski, triggering another group wrestling match.

&amp;#x200B;

“That’s not… You know what, nevermind…” she shook her head.

&amp;#x200B;

“Chaos demons…” Rinn muttered under his breath, glancing back down at his notebook.

&amp;#x200B;

Bradford snorted. “Truth.” She shook her head. “On another note, speaking of the differences between men and women…” she pulled a momentary frown, “And now that Tyehtyeh’s not around… How do keshmin women differ from men?”

&amp;#x200B;

Looking up, he turned to Bradford, pausing to consider how to answer that question. One ear remained locked on the wrestling match.

&amp;#x200B;

“I mean, I’ve gathered from both you and Tyehtyeh that there are a lot of similarities between human and keshmin women, but how similar are we, actually?”

&amp;#x200B;

That brought the full attention of both his ears, and his mouth worked open a little as he tried to figure out how to respond to *that* field of traps.

&amp;#x200B;

She laughed. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to make that awkward.” She took a breath and put on a more serious face. “But seriously, though, what are keshmin women like?”

&amp;#x200B;

“Well, um…” Rinn tugged at a horn. “They’re… Um…” He frowned, flicking his ears at the other Marines then back to her. “Physically, the difference between keshmin men and women isn’t much different than the difference between human men and women, except maybe not as pronounced…” He held up his hands, passing them over each other. “There is more overlap in the range of normal sizes, I think.” He rolled his ears. “At least from what I have seen.” He paused. “And, um… Ah…” *Above and below, this could get terribly inappropriate terribly quickly…* “Keshmin women have… Arrangements…” He gestured in the air, then immediately regrated it. “That are… Similar to, that is, um…”

&amp;#x200B;

“They’ve got boobs, and wide, child-bearing hips?” She gave him an amused smirk.

&amp;#x200B;

He worked his mouth for a moment, glancing around the room, looking for something that wasn’t her… arrangements, before settling on her eyes with a defeated sag of his ears. “Yes, that.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Similar proportions?”

&amp;#x200B;

“Thirty six, twenty-four, thirty-six!” Edison commented, sauntering back out of the shower, waving his hands in an hour-glass figure, before winking at both of them and pitting a finger to his lips while spinning his damp towel into a twist.

&amp;#x200B;

“Yes…” he said, gladly distracted by Edison’s elaborate sneaking.

&amp;#x200B;

She chuckled, shaking her head. “Is that it?”

&amp;#x200B;

“Well, no,” he said, turning back to Bradford. “Women tend to have thinner, more lithe tails, though depending on how their fur is, it can be difficult to spot that.” He tapped his horns. “And women don’t have long horns. They *have* horns, but they’re only buttons, only a finger or two long.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Oh,” she tilted her head. “Huh.” She smirked. “So from the neck up, all those boys over there,” she nodded at the wrestling pile of Marines, “Look pretty damn effeminate from a keshmin perspective?”

&amp;#x200B;

He chuckled, flicking his ears in amusement. “Yeah, now that I think about it… They kind of do.” 

&amp;#x200B;

Edison had finally snuck into position, and with a loud *crack!* he snapped an unidentified Marine in the ass.

&amp;#x200B;

“Ahhhh!” somebody screamed in an unidentifiably high pitch. “Fuck!”

&amp;#x200B;

The dogpile fell apart as Edison laid into them with his towel, though he was quickly tackled and disarmed

&amp;#x200B;

Kimber escaped the dog pile and returned to the bucket to retrieve his “clippers.” He started gathering things up to put them away, then noticed Rinn and Bradford watching the group. He looked down at the clippers, then back up at Rinn with a downright evil smile. “Hey, Shields! You wanna join the tradition?!”

&amp;#x200B;

Rinn’s eyes went wide and his ears straight up in alarm. *No. Gods no…*

&amp;#x200B;

“Yeah, join us!”

&amp;#x200B;

“Candy Mountain, Charlie! Wait, wrong meme…”

&amp;#x200B;

“Guys, he’s got more time in country than the entire rest of the squad combined,” Bradford said, coming to his defense, to his immediate relief. “He doesn’t need to shave anything.”

&amp;#x200B;

“One of us.” Edison said, starting a slow chant as he stalked towards Rinn.

&amp;#x200B;

“One of us!” Gomez joined in.

&amp;#x200B;

Rinn immediately stood up and started backing away. “You 'hink you're 'ouchin me wi'h 'ha', you're ge''in a fireburs' up 'he arse first!”

&amp;#x200B;

“No, brah! Not the floof!” Stephens said, jumping in their path.

&amp;#x200B;

“Shave him!” Davies said, joining the mob.

&amp;#x200B;

“Defend the floof!” Kawalski cried, jumping up beside Stephens.

&amp;#x200B;

“Shave the witch!” Edison cried. “Shave the witch!”

&amp;#x200B;

“Defenders of the floof, unite!” Bradford cried, jumping in front of Rinn as Kimber, Davies, Edison, Sampson, and Gomez all started chanting, “Shave the witch! Shave the witch!”

&amp;#x200B;

Dubois and Miller quickly rallied to their cause as the Shavers advanced. Rinn bolted, his pen and notebook abandoned, and a general melee ensued. 

&amp;#x200B;

He dodged several opponents, until at some point he squared off against Kimber and his buzzing machine of woe. Cackling maniacally, Kimber chased him around the barracks for several minutes before cornering him. Kimber gave a fake evil laugh, and moved in for the shave. Rinn faked left, then dodged right, hitting him with a mild spark to the leg. 

&amp;#x200B;

“Gah! Fuck! Not again!” Kimber fell, knocking over a cot, and rolling on the ground, his clippers forgotten. “It took three hours for that to wear off, last time!”

&amp;#x200B;

Rinn took the opportunity to make good on his escape, hopping across several cots to rejoin his side. Hopping off the last cot next to Bradford, he found that the melee was finished, with his side the victors. 

&amp;#x200B;

“Alright, you fucks, that was fun,” Bradford, chuckling as she caught her breath. “But it’s time to clean this mess up and get to bed.” She gave Rinn a smile and patted him on the back.

&amp;#x200B;

“Yes, mooom,” Kawalski said, turning to start righting an up-turned cot.

&amp;#x200B;

“Fuck you, Kawalski,” she said with a weary shake of her head.

&amp;#x200B;

“Yes, mooom!” the entire squad echoed back.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Rinn was excited. Today was another range day, which was fun enough on its own. *And beats the hell out of PT days…* he thought. But today was a particularly exciting day.

&amp;#x200B;

“Shooters, release your slide and make Condition One.”

&amp;#x200B;

A series of distinctive clacks rolled down the firing line as Rinn and the other artificers thumbed the slide release on the side of the M9 pistols they had been given. After an hour on the range, drilling with an empty weapon, they had finally been given direction to load ammunition.

&amp;#x200B;

“Shooters, stand by. Fire!”

&amp;#x200B;

He thumbed off the safety, took aim down the sights like he had been taught, and squeezed the trigger. He felt the point when the hammer released, and the weapon bucked in his hands as fire and thunder spit from the barrel. A barrage spread down the line as the other keshmin all took their first shot. 

&amp;#x200B;

Rinn’s ears lifted under his earmuffs, and he grinned. The recoil was notable, but not nearly as great as he had feared. He even hit the target, though his accuracy wasn’t great. The next shot was better, and he really understood what the Marines meant when they warned him about the difference between single and double-action. 

&amp;#x200B;

They emptied a full magazine one shot at a time, and then were directed to reload, and shoot another magazine, this one with double shots. Afterward, they were given additional magazines, and moved to another range set for their crash course in what the Marines called their Combat Pistol Program.",/r/HFY/comments/kblwir/retreat_hell_episode_14/,165
59,kd8n33,HFY,Tue Dec 15 00:51:20 2020,Dong Snatchers from Beyond the Stars,"Imagine the horror that Tim Pritchard felt when he woke up to discover that his kibbles and bits had gone missing. Imagine feeling as utterly confused and powerless as he did when his hand traveled south and found nothing but smooth skin. These feelings overwhelmed his brain, and he responded with much screaming. This went along the lines of, ""What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck?"" He continued in that vein for some minutes. During this time, he left his bed, stripped off his boxers, and got a good look at himself in his full-length mirror.

His hand hadn't deceived him. His gentlemen's vegetables were absent. He looked not just like a Ken doll, but specifically a Ken doll marketed as Existential Horror Ken.

In the span of a few seconds, Tim considered (and rejected) the following explanations:

-This was all a dream. (Pinching his earlobe changed nothing.)
-A vengeful ex-girlfriend had given him a dickectomy in the night. (Where was the blood and stitches?)
-He'd never had any nuts and bolts in the first place. (If that were true, then he was so completely insane that nothing mattered.)

As the mind does when it loses all sense of reality, Tim's retreated into shock. He spent maybe thirty minutes pacing a tight circle in his bedroom while cupping the space between his legs and muttering gibberish to himself.

A violent fit of puking freed him from the shock. If we're being generous, we can say that he got about half of last night's risotto into the toilet. The rest decorated his bathroom's floor, sink, mirror, and bathtub like a poorly thought-out Halloween decoration.

Once he'd voided his interior, Tim rested in the narrow gap between his toilet and bathtub. Vomit puddled around his left butt cheek. He mulled over possible next steps.

Any day was a terrible day for a man to lose his Titanic and lifeboats, but for Tim, today was an especially bad one. This was to have been the first of a week's worth of shoots for Tommy Hilfiger's underwear line. As all male underwear models knew, when it came to showcasing underwear, the dong mattered. There was no way he could show up to the shoot packing as much heat as a mall cop.

Where did that leave Tim? He supposed he could call in sick, though he wasn't up to the task of explaining to his agent Terry, an old battle-axe of woman, what exactly ailed him. Regardless, he figured he should at least get a doctor to look at him. There might be some obscure disease by the name of Penile Vanishment. If he was lucky, all it'd take was a shot and some pills to get his jolly lads back in business. 

That sounded great, but it meant there was no avoiding Terry. He thumped his head against the wall and let out a groan and a ""Fuck!"" He heaved himself up from puddle of lukewarm puke and made the call. 

Terry responded with her typical grace and charm. ""Don't gimme none of that bullshit, Timmy. I've got the lung cancer and I punch in everyday. You trying to tell me you got it worse than lung cancer? What've you got? Flesh-eating disease? Huh? Gangrene of the asshole? Is that it?""

""It's hard to explain. It's not something I've ever heard of.""

""Is that right? Did your dick fall off?""

Tim's heart skipped a beat, and another beat, and a whole bar's worth of beats, before coming online again. For a microsecond, he wondered whether Terry had done this to him. That was, of course, ridiculous. She had the moneymaking instincts of a federal mint. She'd never harm Tim's ability to earn.

All this thinking took longer than Terry was willing to put up with. She coughed, quite viciously, into the phone, and said, ""Did. Your. Dick. Fall. Off?""

There was no use putting it off any longer. ""Yes.""

Terry responded with what for her could only be considered aplomb. ""Fuck off, you liar.""

""It did, Terry.""

""You're shitting me. I just got done seeing about that on the TV.""

""Seeing about what on the TV?"" How could there already be a news story about Tim's sausage and eggs going missing?

""There's some sort of global whodunnit going on. Guys are waking up with their molehills freshly paved over. If you ask me, that'll be an improvement for most of them. Too much time spent thinking with their schlongs, that's most fellas' problem. Are you seriously telling me you've been schlitzed? You're not making this up to get out of work? Huh? Because let me tell you again that I busted my huge, cancer-riddled ass to get you this gig.""

""I'm not making this up. Down there,"" Tim waved his hand in front of his crotch, ""it's all smooth.""

""Yikes. I need a puffa."" There came the rattling sound of Terry sucking a cigarette into the hole at the base of her throat. ""S'pose you can't work without your junk, huh?""

""The dong matters, Terry.""

""That's right. The dong matters.""

An awkward silence followed, during which the only sounds that could be heard were the rattling of Terry's throat hole, the muttering of her TV, and the tapping of Tim's fingertips against his kitchen countertop.

""Hold on,"" Terry said, ""get onto the TV. The President's about to make an announcement.""

Thankful that he might be about to get some clarity, Tim flipped on his flatscreen. President Carbuncle was there in the Oval Office, looking his usual mottled self. The man's face was half liver spot, half freckle, all wrinkle. He looked like a leather chair. The scroller along the bottom of the screen read THE DISAPENIS: THE TRUTH COMES OUT: THE PRESIDENT SPEAKS: LIVE.

The President said, ""My fellow Americans, nay, my fellow citizens of Earth. I bring you an announcement that will unsettle your understanding of our place here on God's green earth. For the last year, a coalition of governments have been in direct contact with extraterrestrials. Yes, they're real. They're called the Don Snaxa.

""The good news is that, while their technology far surpasses our own, they have no intention of using that technology to do us any harm. We've reached a peace accord, and this bond of friendship will see our two species soaring in the 21st century.

""The bad news, of which some of you are already aware, is that the aliens only agreed to this peace accord on condition that they may harvest one sixteenth of all human penises on the planet. It would appear our male genitalia hold some important meaning for them, and they would not agree to easy relations without this concession.

""For those who don't have penises or whose penises are intact, this is all gain. For those of you now without penises, well, know that your sacrifice is not in vain. You've assured a place for humanity at the galactic table, and you shall be honoured accordingly as heroes."" 

The President went on to say some airy bullshit about the value of sacrifice, but Tim had heard enough. He was on his feet and shouting at the TV. ""What do you mean I'm gonna be honoured! What do you mean this had to happen! You're only saying that because you've still got your prick, you prick!"" He shrieked like an animal, pulled at his hair, lost his balance, banged his shin against the coffee table, and fell, quite pathetically, onto the carpet. It was in this position that he saw the TV feed cut from the President to footage of a new building in his city's downtown quarter. The screen read ALIEN CONSULATES HAVE ARRIVED!

Tim stabbed a finger at the screen. ""Fuck the accord! I'm coming for you, Dong Snatchers!""",/r/HFY/comments/kd8n33/dong_snatchers_from_beyond_the_stars/,17
63,kdj1o6,HFY,Tue Dec 15 12:03:36 2020,Humanity is Complicated,"I just started a pot of coffee

==============

With nearly the entire world embroiled in battle with an alien invasion hell bent on turning Earth into a galactic version of a ""Dude Ranch of a Death World"" for the wealthy and adventure seeking aliens, the battle came to a stalemate of sorts in a small town in the mid west.  The only thing stopping the invaders were the pesky creatures called humans known to inhabit the Tier 7.5 Death World claimed by the Zolrikik corporation for their plans.

""Fuck this.  Ms. Kitowski, lend me your handkerchief please.  I need to speak to them,""  Perry said to the once heavier set middle aged woman who turned out to be quite the warrior.  Time in battle had worn her weight and gracefully aged beauty to something she would of been in 20 years.  She handed the small white silk square to the near ragged man that once ran the feed store who asked for it.

""I'm not surrendering.  The white flag means more than just that.  I'm simply calling a time out to discuss this unplanned and violent social event.  I'll be back.""

He grabbed two folding camp chairs and held the now white flag above the fortification he was guarding.  His face slowly followed with his body not far behind.  He clamored over holding his arms out and slowly spinning showing he wasn't armed.  Placing a corner of the kerchief in his pocket he quickly demonstrated the chairs to show there was no hidden threat before approaching the assault unit trying to push them back that had been taking cover behind a broken wall and burned out cars.  

He stopped at the half way point and set up the chairs facing each other and sat in one.  Making a curt motion with his hand to the other seat signaling he wanted to talk.  

Slowly, one who looked like he wore some kind of rank handed his weapon off to one of the offenders next to him and began his approach.  To the irritation of Perry they didn't relinquish their side arm strapped to their leg.  

Unknown to Perry the commanding officer was watching through the sensors in the helmets of the raiding force had ordered one of their NCO's to go out and speak to the human.  Seeing and listing to everything.  Recording it for the intelligence group to study.

""Why are you dick heads invading my planet?"" 

""Sorry, I forgot my manners.  I'm Perry, not pleased to meet you.  You're not welcome to my little town of farmers and workers.

""I reckon you've been here long enough to understand us right?""

""Yes we have,"" came a male tone from the helmet the alien was wearing.  The helmet would move a moment before any sound would start denoting a translator.  Standing rigid and the air of sickening superiority and extreme arrogance pouring off the alien as he stood next to the chair refusing to sit.

""You have approached under a white flag of surrender.  We will take no prisoners.  Go and inform the others to line up for execution.  Your planet has been claimed by my company to be turned into a vacation destination.  Your kind have put us behind schedule by four months.  Give up.  You are beaten, *omnivore,*"" the last word dripping with venom as he spoke.

""Ha!  You'll have to kill everyone of us to take this big ball of dirt.  How much have you studied our history alien?""

""It is not necessary to do a lowly scribe's or scholar's work to rid a planet of vermin.  Why do you waste my time?  I should kill you painfully as an example to the others as to what will follow their continued resistance.""

Perry got a good laugh out of that.  ""We humans have rules for war.  One important one is don't shoot the messenger.  Another is when approached under a white flag you don't harm those waving it.  Unless they try harming you while displaying it.  Sit.  We have much to discuss pond skipper.

""You do understand we are predators right?  No claws, small teeth, slow runners, thin skin, not having fur leaves us at the mercy of the weather.  But you know what we do have?""  Perry paused a moment before tapping the side of his head.  ""A three pound lump of bone wrapped bacon that puts any computer you know of to shame.  Hands that can craft the most delicate of tools.  Teeth for meat and plants letting us eat nearly anything that grows or moves.  And with unknown years of doing that has let us partake of natural poisons *for fun* and *flavor.* The ability to walk for days.  Some humans can run for days without stopping.  Sensitive skin that lets us feel incredibly small differences in temperature, texture, and size.  That's just the physical aspects.

""The mental things about humans, so many to list.  We are a VERY war like species.  We fight each other often.  Often enough in history we have many rules-

""Rules for war?  Pathetic.  Only a lowly spec-

""*I wasn't finished twat waffle.*  Now sit down.*""*  The alien rocked back a fraction of an inch at the insulting demeanor Perry had talking to him.  ""Yes rules, otherwise this planet would be a nuclear waste land.""  Another twitch from the invader leader.  ""Ah, yes, we have nuclear technology.  We weaponized it before we harnessed it for good uses.  We, Americans that is, the country you're currently and incredibly stupidly invading, used them in war.  Twice.  *Twice.*  Even without the nukes we needed the rules to keep from fighting ourselves to extinction.  

""We don't target civilians like you fucked up doing.  We don't use chemical or biological weapons anymore.  We did that in the first world wide war.  'The Great War' it is called.  The war to end all wars.  Heh heh.  We quit with chemicals and microbes then used nukes in the second war that spanned the globe.  

""There's many other rules for war.  If people surrender to you you have to take care of them.  Treat their wounds, feed and water them.  I notice you leave your wounded to die.  Fucking animals.""

""*ANIMALS!?""* the alien suddenly raged at Perry unable to contain his anger anymore.  ""You're the one laying out your bloody history with what appears to be pride!""

""Yes pride!  We survived it and learned from it.  *We* *adapted to war,""* Perry hissed at the clueless xeno raider.  ""We now have our 'warrior class' who volunteers to serve in our armed forces.  We only attack targets connected to enemy military operations.  Yes mistakes are made but we have groups dedicated to helping the wounded and displaced.  To heal and rebuild for them.  We call this Passing a Great Filter.  Our scientists believe many civilizations end up destroying themselves in wars before they can reach the stars like you.  

""We made rules to teach those that come after us of our mistakes and the mistakes of those that came before us so they don't get repeated again and again.  

""This is what makes us so dangerous to you.  You don't play by any rules but your own.  You push, we push back.  You push harder, we push back harder.  It didn't take us long to realize you meant to wipe us out.  That's a big push.  Biggest one since our nuclear awakening, in lack of a better term.  We humans have climbed our way to the top of the food chain by out fighting anything that tries to push us around.  

""I should kill you here for your tone alone *human.*""  

Perry just grinned at that.  ""You didn't come out here thinking I didn't have back up did you?  Foolish.  You must be young.  Our young act like you,"" Perry spoke before thinking earning a scoff from the alien in front of him still not sitting.

""There are no less than seven high powered deer rifles pointed at your right now.""

""Please enlighten me human.  What are these deer rifles?""

""You know why you keep your head down?  Those single terrifying shots that drops one of you guys before you hear anything?  Sniper rifles and deer rifles are the same thing.  It's a hunting rifle.""

""You hunt?"" the xeno's tone showing either a touch of morbid curiosity or disgust.  The translator wasn't the most efficient here.

""Yes we do.  White tail deer.  Nothing really dangerous.""

""Why if you have your *herds* of animals you slaughter every day?  And why would you need such a powerful weapon for an animal that isn't dangerous?"" venom dripping from his words again.

""Several reasons,"" Perry piped up, a feral grin spreading across his face with the chance to talk of something other than war.  ""Economical.  Keep the population in check.  Sport.  To sate the latent predator instincts deep inside every human.  But probly the most important reason they are very tasty.  Back strap dredged in flour, seared in a cast iron skillet in a red wine reduction with morel mushrooms.  Oooooooh mmmmmyyyyy that is good.""  

As Perry spoke the creature before him seemed to shrink ever so slightly back in disgust.  Or fear.  

""And the rifles we use are designed to make the death of our quarry as fast and painless as possible.  It's not humane to allow what you want to kill to suffer needlessly.""

And with that the raider leader was called back to his line and a cease fire world wide was called.  The corporate directors in charge of the invasion force wanting to study the human ways more closely because they didn't realize they had found what they now classified a Tier 10 predator species capable of taking to the stars on their own in a short time.  The first Tier 10 ever found and the only predator species capable of more than fire and crude roof.

As Perry collected the chairs to return to his trench he called to the aliens back and the others taking cover across the street, ""Aufweidersein arschgeige!"" with a wave that turned to a single finger salute.

While a Death World vacation resort would of been a lucrative business it wasn't worth losing the rest of the companies private army on the planet.  With all the ""war trophy"" technology the humans now had they would have what they needed to reach interstellar space in the next five years rather than the next forty.  The directors thought it important to ready the galaxy for the incoming predators who were in fact self aware monsters who shackled themselves in laws to keep from self destructing.  And to try to get onto good terms with what could be the most dangerous species to ever live *before* their ships left Earth for a new star.

Station 11

(Warning: Parasites)

Serrated teeth flashed before John’s eyes, the maw that could swallow his head whole flexed and brandished the tools of the predator inches from his face. He focused more intently on them, moisture forming on his brow as the three rows of killing implements showed their deadly points before him. A thin coating of pink blood on his fingers as he held his tools, “Have you been flossing twice a day?” John asked as his rubber-gloved thumb and index finger pulled cheek skin back to expose deeper teeth to the overhead medical lamp for inspection. The pink gums were tender and soft, pulled back from the teeth. The large alien, whose tongue gently traced its freshly cleaned teeth, made a sheepish face as far as John's training of expressions could guess and rumbled out a word through John’s fingers with some difficulty. 

“Yes, I have.” The translator buzzed. John grimaced behind his mask, *Liar! Lying through all three rows of teeth!* And grabbed a packet of floss off a nearby table.

“Well, let’s just go over them here and you’ll be free to go.” He responded cheerfully. The hygienist's profession was never an easy one, patients and subjects seemed to go out of their way to make his job harder. The work was much-in-demand in all things interspecies. Knowing what to use and how to make an environment clean for occupation by several species, and *keeping* it clean. Keeping the floors free from whatever organic matters may be left from treading, keeping the air free of skin cells that may irritate a more sensitive sensory organ, and the hardest: personal hygiene. Living aboard Research Station 11 for The Commonwealth of Sentient Races could take some adjustment for any newcomer; being faced with dozens of new sights, sounds, and smells is a daunting challenge. John’s job was to keep it from being too daunting. His father didn’t approve of it, citing that it was nothing more than a glorified janitorial position. John tried to explain the necessity of hygiene for interspecies interaction, and the critical need for it in self-contained environments like a station but it never convinced him. How could it? His father was a Martian dustbeater, someone who had never left their birth planet.

So, John sat with the head of a Roowa beneath his fingers, working a piece of floss through the carnivore’s many teeth until his poor fingers ached. Every time the floss bit too deep into its gums, the alien’s lips and eyes would twitch. Once his gloved fingers were greased in the alien’s blood he rinsed out its mouth and let it out of his workroom. He watched as the red speckled grey alien  lifted itself on its six legs and left while rubbing its jaw with a front hand to soothe the aches in it. Double checking his to-do list, John made sure that he had no other patients lined up. He decided to go get some dinner at the mess hall formatted for other oxygen breathers.

Walking through the tubular hallways was always a source of stress; a menagerie of striding, crawling, flying, walking, or marching fellow co-workers in a variety of beautifully horrific shapes was constantly packing the tubes. As was the habit of beings of higher need for cognition, they were often lost in thought and staring at the ceiling idly as they walked, a danger for those smaller than them. John swallowed hard as he passed a human with a black psi trident among the other symbols for psychology, like the twin moons of Yula and the Crown of Fen on the shoulder of her uniform. While an obvious necessity to keep the gears moving smoothly and the occupants sane in a multi-species station isolated in deepest space, he could never get over the feeling they always looked at him like a potential nutcase.

Passing by the maternal ward he gazed through the window. There were a dozen or so toddlers doing things that entertained the simple minded. Stacking blocks or coloring on blanks of papers. The walls were coated in letters and cartoon depictions of humans and aliens holding hands. What drew his attention and affection was the long segmented body of the charge nurse. The body was wrapped in a soft cloth that the young human children would find pleasant to be picked up in. It was currently looking over a table at a drawing a child was making, praising the efforts of the artist. Something in John felt strange, like a wolf was baying at the moon. He closed his eyes and winced, not letting wish fulfillment distract him on his way to eat.

Heading into the cafeteria he saw his friends, he wormed his way through the crowds of tables and awkward looking chairs. Once there, he was greeted by Cholila the Dori holding its news tablet with one of its appendages and another eating its food, with its long snake-like body awkwardly draped over a chair not designed for it. “Earthling and Doriling supremacy groups are up squeezing each other again. Apparently, an Earthling had brought a late delivery in and a Dori tried to punish them —as was their custom. The Earthling fought back —as was their custom— and now there is an interstellar cultural court case. Both sides claim their party is the victim from their culture’s point of view and the lawyers are walking on eggshells. Neither side wants to decide a winning party and cause a riot on the other side. Earth wouldn’t have any problems if it took care of its alien problem. Damn off-worlders are ruining everything.”

Snorting at the knee-jerking greeting he sat down with a meal. “And a good day to you, Cholila. I would not expect a Dori like you to have that opinion.”

Cholila’s face contorted, the membranes on its face tightening, “I was hatched in Australia, I am —by definition— an Earthling.”

“Not that many Earthlings have four arms and venom glands.” He retorted, biting into a sandwich.

“Some Earthlings are hatched luckier than others.” It replied, accent poking through just a bit. 

“So how does an Alien go from their home world, to Earth, then to a space station?”

“Rishathra.”

“Christ, Cholila, I am about to eat here.”

“Haha, but no. My parents came to Earth for the sake of adventure, and I suppose I did the same to come here. I could have been on the staff in any research facility, or retired by curing the ailments of the rich; but that seemed bland to me. Now I suffer aches and pains waking up in space from having a hundred things to do. Someone fed dairy to a Galdian— who are incredibly lactose intolerant, I’ve had to treat boils on the ass, there was even a ship full of plagued aliens last week! Today I found someone with a pet that isn’t in our databases. Out here in Station 11 you really can’t afford a headache. But if you asked me if my life I left behind was better, I’d tell you no.”

Right then another accomplice sat down, causing him and others to let out a sigh and rest their faces in their palms as they saw the sin that was on the tray. The taboos of what food could be combined together were some of the most common to be broken, this was no exception. A bowl of spaghetti, nothing wrong with that, but a dollop of peanut butter on it. Knowing the reaction of the co-workers well, the perpetrator rocked back and forth in its own amusement before braiding the noodles so it could eat it together.

Sex and gender when talking used to be an issue, until the psychologists implemented the rule. Their power was never quite measured compared to other divisions, and they rarely came forward with what rules they created. Since it was quite impossible to memorize all the differences and nuances of all beings, paired with the risk of insult at misidentification high, paired with biases that meant nothing when applied to an outgroup, the psychology department decided that it was best to use the ‘it’ in referring to another being. While it may seem cruel and depersonalized, one could quickly adapt to it.

Unfortunately, his time expressing his displeasure at the horrendous meal was cut short as his phone buzzed with a new notification reading, ‘Department of Psychology-Alert’. Apparently, they changed his schedule for an immediate meeting, never a good sign. Bidding farewell to his friends in the mess hall, he once again plunged into the tubular hallways of the station.

The antechamber of the psychologist he was meeting held two desks on either side, both occupied. One was the woman he saw in the hallways before his meal who greeted him warmly by his name. The other was a large purple insect whose shell gleamed with iridescence. He knew of their kind, how sensitive the pencil-thick antenna sprouting from their long head was. They could be trained and educated to detect the emotional states of other beings and render them effectively empaths. Perspiration formed on his brow, if it knew how he felt it didn’t bother to acknowledge him in any way. The woman opened the office door and ushered him inside.

The inside was a well-furnished room, a curved desk near the back wall with different chairs for different body types in front of it. Behind the desk was a sour, old-looking man who was known as Dr. Calhoun. John immediately let out a sigh of relief as he approached the grimacing old man. When a psychologist shows you a sympathetic face, you know you have a problem, a grimace meant you were mentally fit. John and Dr. Calhoun sat quietly staring at each other, the old mental trick of who would break first. John knew humans found silence unbearable and would seek to fill it with chit chat, chit chat that might expose mental secrets. John sat with his leg bouncing impatiently until Calhoun broke first, starting to speak with a slow and measured pace. “...Do you know why you are here…?”

John shook his head, “No, I just got the message not long ago to show up. So here I am.”

“Well, then I get to be the bearer of good news. It’s your turn for a vacation” This caught John off guard for sure.

“Oh? This is all a bit sudden don’t you think?” There was a pop in Dr. Calhoun’s jaw, he was a man to quickly grow impatient with repeated questions.

“The reasons you were selected are important to the department, would you like to turn this down?”

“Uhh, no. Of course not. When and where is it?”

“Dori, and there is a shuttle waiting now.” With that, Dr. Calhoun gave a wave of his wrinkled hand, seemingly done with John after promptly and suddenly uprooting him. The power that the department had was certainly unknown to most, if they had the power of the administration under their domain. John was more than willing to comply with the department’s wishes, he didn’t know what kind of statistics they had on him but if they felt that this was urgently needed, then it was urgently needed... Everything they did they claimed was in the interest of keeping people sane, even if the people grumbled and complained about it.

As John was leaving he made a comment to the two in the antechamber, “Whew, I feel a lot better leaving his office than I felt going in.”

“I know.” said the empath.

\---

Tourism was an ever-important tool for all planets, as the sightseeing went both ways. On one hand, tourists got to experience amazing sights and cultures of a completely alien world. On the other appendage, the natives got to see an alien peaceably and casually among their population. It acted as a way to prevent a cultural inferiority complex of thinking that their culture or planet wasn’t worth visiting compared to others. Hence the travel plan included stops at several major population centers and cultural locations. The trip was a week-long journey around the continent in an airship, crewed by Dori and traveled by aliens such as John. They even had their own doctor on the crew.

His co-passengers were pleasant enough company that one could ask for. There was a group of off-world authors who came to visit under the guise of a business trip for inspiration and research. They were fun to converse with, always eager for a new perspective on a myth, or to broaden their understanding with folk stories. Two more passengers he shared his trip with were shier than the others, keeping to themselves. The passengers were Galdians, beings that supported their mottled grey-haired body on six equally spaced limbs, giving them the appearance of a walking table. From what he observed from their conversations in universal sign language, he deduced that they were siblings- making a family trip. The last of the passengers was definitely the most forward in conversing with him- Admira, the human.

He was grateful for her company, as would any man be. She was an attractive and young woman. From the way her muscles and fat were laid out on her body, he could tell she was born on Earth, compared to his much lighter Martian frame. Admira was smart too, she was here as a reward for graduating with a degree in communications. He was not ignorant of her hints and advances, picking up on the fact that she would drop in conversations about how she never had time to date in college. He noted her interest in his job; smiling, twirling her raven black hair and piercing him with her deep green eyes while he explained his work. Funny how simply working with aliens was a rudimentary routine to him, but the height of interest to those who never mingled among other beings. The only problem he seemed to be having was that he wasn’t interested in her, and he didn’t know why. She was plenty attractive and engaging, so he was puzzled why he felt no need to return her affections.

The next stop on the tour was a major port city named Hooka. From the high altitude he could see the sprawling grey structures of the city squished up to a white scar— the beach. Separating the city from the deep blue ocean that sprawled out, attempting to match the city in its vastness, the beach was renowned for its tourism. The long and sandy beach had wonderful soft sand and beautiful azure water, gentle waves lapping at the shore line. The white sand was soft under his bare feet as he walked along with Admira, both holding their bags of souvenirs they had purchased from the merchant district. John had found a small model of an ancient siege weapon that he thought he may enjoy building. Other visitors to the beach, Dorilings mainly, occasionally held their stares at the pair of humans-probably in a secret hope they may see courtship behaviors. John was at least grateful they kept their distance and didn’t point and gawk. Apparently, the Dori custom of relaxing was to dig a trench so they could rest their long bodies in the sand, causing an interesting pattern along the beach. Setting their bags down Admira smiled at him, lightly grabbing his elbow and asked, “Hey, wanna go for a swim? That water looks great!”

“Oh, I uhh. I’d love to, but I don’t know how to swim.” Mars had very few large bodies of water for swim lessons. She beamed a smile at him.

“I can teach you! I used to be a swim instructor back in high school, I loved working with those kids.” The subtle hint was not lost on him, nonetheless, he consented to her offer. Shortly, he found himself chest-deep in the ocean, clutching to her forearms as she held onto his. The pair of Galdians thrashed playfully in the water nearby as they worked their exercises. Pushing up from the ground, treading water for a few minutes, before resting back on the ground. She was a good teacher, and her smile was encouraging as he became adept enough to tread water on his own.

After the duo’s lesson was finished they relaxed on their towels. John’s muscles ached from having to support his weight for so long in this gravity. Admira was propped up on her elbow to face him as they chatted about his progress, claiming that a few more lessons with her and he’ll be able to swim laps. His train of focus was quickly diverted by a primal feeling. The instinctual feeling of a few strands of his leg hair being moved— nature’s telltale to a man that something was crawling on his body. His spine shivered as he inspected his leg, Admira being momentarily forgotten for the moment. He didn’t *see* anything, but the feeling persisted until he ran his hand down his wet leg and found the offender. It was a worm— flat and the length of his pinky. He quickly identified it as a parasite from his experience of being a hygienist. It was that it was completely clear, like an amoeba under a microscope. Visible now that it wasn’t flattened on his wet skin. Admira let out a sound of disgust as he brought it off his leg. “Eww. What is that thing?”

“A parasite. Don’t worry, it can’t live off of you, your body is too different. The worst thing that an alien parasite can do is die inside you and cause a bit of sepsis. Come here, let me check you over.” Closely inspecting her body he pulled off three from her body, throwing the parasites on the sand to wither and die. The hardest one to remove was hiding in the hair on the back of her head. He pulled off another one hiding on his side as well. 

On the ship, he made sure to shower extra-long, inspecting his body once again for any stragglers. A mental alarm was going off in his head, something instinctual telling him a problem was nearby. He began reviewing all he had done: there was no blood or wounds, so they weren’t inside of him or Admira, he inspected her scalp thoroughly and his hair was kept too short for hiding. So why did he feel like he was forgetting something? The realization of his blatant mistake hit him at once, swearing at his stupidity. The two Galdians were also in the water, and with hair that thick the parasites would be hard to remove. Infection would be guaranteed if the parasite corpses were not removed before they began to decay. He doubted Dori medical facilities were appropriately equipped or that their doctors were trained to treat an alien, leaving the hygienist the most qualified being in a few light-years.

John found the crew and passengers at dinner, and a spot across from Admira obviously saved for him. She smiled as he entered the dining room, motioning for him to sit down. He marched to the ship’s doctor and hurriedly whispered in its ear. “There’s a problem. The Galdian duo was in the water and I think they are infected. They need to be cleaned before an infection sets in.” The doctor bared its long and sharp teeth at him, John jumped back in surprise at the suddenly hostile behavior. The mood at the dinner table was thoroughly ruined now, with all eyes on them.

“Must all Dori do as an Earthling says? The Clear Tral parasite is harmless, it lives off of fish. It does nothing to Dori- or to aliens. Now be silent, I shall not do whatever meaningless requests come from an Earthling.” The voice had a bitter tone to it. Such a hostile response was unexpected, his alien co-workers usually happy to consent to his requests. This was not a co-worker though— this being was a Dori dustbeater.

“Doctor, it isn’t about whether they can be infected by the parasite, this is about their body’s response to the dead parasites. If not cleaned they will develop sepsis and if not treated- they will perish.” John pleaded. The two Galdians glanced at each other and then at the doctor and John. Understandably the siblings were nervous about having their health discussed in a public area and worried about their immediate health.

“I shall not do anything, because there is nothing to do. As you can see they are in perfect health. Should you attempt to practice anything on them, remember that you have no license to practice on Dori, I do. You would do well to remember our customs, as I know you Earthlings are self-centered and care only for your own backward ways.” The captain finally intervened, raising two of his four arms in an X shape to demand a cease of the conversation. John stared with his mouth agape, dumbfounded at the response he had received from a supposed being of medical background. 

Feeling unwelcome at the table, and with the doctor’s glare at his backside, he left to go to his room. He paced back and forth across the room fuming as he went over the conduct in his mind. He found the situation utterly absurd, impossible even. That a man of science would have its views so contorted that it couldn’t see good advice. He sat in his own self imposed time-out, thinking over what he could do about the situation. Working on the model kit he bought, John began to slowly assemble it to calm himself down, using the pair of forceps to work the small pieces.

An hour after he left the dinner there was a knock on the door, behind it were two nervous-looking Galdians. They clutched their front tentacles in a twirled manner, clenching and unclenching them. Using universal sign language they explained that what they had heard at dinner, their fears of possible infection were not extinguished by the Dori doctor. The sibling duo then requested if there was any way they could at least be examined by the human to double-check. John welcomed them into the room, agreeing to their request and angling a nearby lamp to use as a mock medical light.

It did not take long for the hygienist to spot what he was looking for amongst the long mottled grey hairs. Buried deep into their hide he could see the small bodies embedded partway, small tails twirled among clumps of hair. The clear bodies displayed evidence they tried to latch into the blood, but lack of familiar nutrients caused them to quickly starve and die, corpses still connected. John motioned for the smaller Galdian to hand him his tweezers from the model kit, a far cry from his familiar medical equipment, but if he were to ask the doctor for its medical equipment he would certainly be arrested for medical malpractice. 

The operation went smooth enough, John was used to paying attention to fine details for long periods. The memories of his instructor working echoed in his head, a big being with many arms telling him ‘Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast,’ as it performed tedious cleanings. The removal of the parasites, followed by placing a cloth on the wound to stop the bleeding, was work he was not a stranger to. The only interruption to his work was Admira stopping by, face full of shock as she saw him in his room with two aliens that he was meticulously grooming.

She was more than pleased to see him currently working, even offering to help him. He declined, claiming it would be irresponsible to have her inexperienced hands used in the operation as well as the legal consequences if they were caught. John continued the fine work while pleasantly chatting with her. She eventually hinted at the possibility of meeting him some other time after the vacation, since they had such a pleasant time together. He declined it, and her face suddenly became mortified as she asked, “John. I’m so sorry… Am I the wrong gender?”

“No, wrong species.” He responded flatly, too engrossed in his work to fully realize his response. Suddenly it made sense, the reasons he never felt the biological need to reciprocate her advances or seek out her attention.

“Well, I did not expect that. Well, either way I’m helping you with these two. You’ll never finish both of them before their absence is noted.”

“Fine, but if anyone asks I acted alone in this situation. No need to for both of us to get caught.”

It was during his final pass over for any parasites he was finally caught. He had allowed Admira to leave a few minutes before, since most of the work was done. Security had been making rounds and went to check on the passengers. Imagine their shock when they opened a room with two aliens covered in bloody bandages and a human working over them with tweezers. The doctor gave him an earful of insults and ridicule, mocking his lack of respect for local customs and medical decency. The captain ordered him to be confined to his quarters under guard until they touched down again, informing him that he would be detained there for medical malpractice. He sat quietly in his room, contemplating his fate and future. The case was solidly against him: he operated without a license, and without proper consent forms. No matter how the Galdian pleaded that they consented, there were no proper medical forms.

Sitting alone in his room gave him plenty of time to ponder his future. The energy of determination and anger gone out of him, replaced by grey, oppressive misery. He watched broadcasts of a Dori trivia show, the breaks being populated with snippets of news stories. It seems he had made the headlines already, and each interview was more colorful in their language than the last. They postured and demanded claims— that aliens stop doing as they pleased and abided by their customs. John felt very unwelcome on this planet for an act he would do a hundred times over to save the lives of the Galdians.

A few days passed of the temporary imprisonment before anything of note happened, much time was given to the alien co-worker he had seen in the maternal ward. The object of one’s affection could live rent free in one’s mind it would seem. The door opened to reveal the pearlescent exoskeleton of the alien from the antechamber of the psychologist’s office. The translator buzzed, “Glad to see you are having pleasant thoughts. My name is Zenpho, we have met before.” John blushed, having been caught red-handed.

“What? What are you doing here?”

“I am here to come and debrief you, the Gladians have high praise for your performance.” It welcomed itself into the room, sitting across from John. “So, tell me, have you felt any stress or anxiety?”

“What are you talking about? What did the Galdians say? Debrief me?” Zenpho’s antennae quivered in response to John’s emotional turmoil, effectively wincing.

“Yes, debrief you. You were participating in an experiment of shifting public opinion by measuring the possible impact that heroic actions committed by offworlders. We had it arranged to bring you to Dori so you may render aid on the Galdians, and have the Dori press report it so we can measure opinion polls.”

“Wait, so the Galdians were in on it?”

“The preferred term is confederates with the experiment, but yes. The Galdians are students of xenopsychology and reported their observations to me on your performance. The captain and doctor were also informed and instructed to bring about the scenario for action.”

“So all of this was fake?” John felt emptiness filling him, that his efforts were for naught but being a lab rat.

“No, absolutely not. Your actions were as genuine as if this experiment did not exist. Which is what we wanted, for you to act in genuine altruism. Admira was not in on it though, a pleasant surprise of aid to be noted and she has been offered a position at the station. Dr. Calhoun would like to further investigate your sexual attraction at the station though, such behaviors are highly desired for observation! Have you had any wish fulfillment dreams lately?” Zenpho said cheerfully.

The only thing he dreaded about returning back to his station was the meeting he would have to have about with Dr. Calhoun...",/r/HFY/comments/ke3hoc/station_11/,2

US SUPREME COURT RULES ON COBRIAT v. US DOJ

Originally developed for scientific and historical use, temporal lensing is a critical tool in modern law enforcement. However, this tool has recently come under fire in the case of Miles Cobriat vs the US Department of Justice.

The use of temporal lensing for law enforcement has grown in the past six years from federal agency use to small town law enforcement agencies. The use of temporal lensing has allowed law enforcement to correctly identify people who have committed crimes with a nearly perfect record, bypassing the need for witnesses, and in some cases, as it was in the trial of Miles Cobriat, who had been accussed of a brutal series of rapes that took place in multiple states over a period of ten years, without the need for any evidence beyond temporal lensing recordings.

However, lawyers for Cobriat have long argued that no warrant for temporal imaging was ever issued, nor is there any method for obtaining temporal imaging to preserve the integrity of the imaging. While juries are shown the events as recorded by temporal lensing, there is no paper trial, chain of custody, evidence procedures, or any other legal defenses for the accused.

Temporal lensing has been in use by law enforcement agencies for nearly six years, resulting in drop in crime of nearly 14% across the United States.

Today, the Supreme Court ruled on the use of temporal lensing by law enforcement agencies.

In a split decision of 5-4, the use of temporal lensing by law enforcement, without a specific warrant to search the 'temporal premises' as well as the physical premises, was ruled illegal.

This has put a stop to all uses of temporal lensing by US law enforcement, as well as forcing nearly two million court cases to be retried based on 'traditional evidence', which victim advocacy groups claim will put tens of thousands of hardened criminals back on the streets.

&amp;#x200B;

On a stretch of lonely highway, on a mostly empty bus, rode the unnamed stranger.  His eyes closed, his arms folded beneath his jacket, he seemed deep in the throes of sleep, muttering to himself, lost entirely to the strange mores of dream logic.

In reality, his soul sat in a simple chair on a small platform, surrounded entirely by the fathomless darkness of the Abyss.  The pinnacle of empty oblivion, where naught seemingly existed except the sound of the man's enthusiastic narration.

“Through the heartlands of America, travels a mysterious stranger with a terrible secret! Bearing an ancient curse, he wanders the land in search of redemption whilst—

“What are you doing?” Demanded a rasping voice that echoed out of the absolute darkness, its tone heavy with irritation.

“Ah!” Replied the stranger's cheerful sounding voice.  A voice that would make anyone’s fist reflexively clench in anticipation of beating the face that bore it into the ground. 

“There’s the guy, himself! Well, Partner, I’m narrating the introduction to our weird adventures like it was a seventies serial like *Kung-Fu* or *The Incredible Hulk.* You know, because we wander from town to town, making the wrong things right, while trying to discover a cure to our horrific condition. We always save the day but then we have to move on, despite the friends we make along the way. It’s very sad, but also *very* telegenic. “

“What? Is *that* what you think we do?”

“Absolutely! I mean, we’re an odd enough pairing, it’s true. There’s me, the nameless wanderer cursed eternally for alleged crimes against a world that doesn’t even exist anymore—

*“Because* of your actions, you loathsome monster.”

\--And there’s you, the Death Knight, fiendish embodiment of the horrors of the Age of Power—

“A malicious slander leveed against my noble order by the baleful victors of an unjust war.”

\--I solve mysteries, you deal with the crooks—

“You blunder haplessly into untenable situations, get yourself slaughtered like a farmer’s prized hog by whatever bloodthirsty miscreant happens to be hiding in the shadows this week, and then I in turn kill them out of the sheer frustration of not being able to kill *you*, myself.”

“See? We’ve got a real Odd Couple situation going on. That’s seventies television in a nutshell!”

“By the night, finish your senseless narration so we can be done with this idiocy.”

“All right, all right. Ahem! *Throughout the heartlands of America, travels a mysterious stranger with a terrible secret! Bearing an ancient curse, he wanders the highways in search of redemption.* *For wherever evil thrives, there shall swing the sword of…THE SKETHIAN!”* 

“Good. Fine. Are you finished?” Demanded the rasping voice.

“What? No, now we have to start the credit sequence.”

“I hate you *so* much.”

The voice eventually faded, leaving the stranger alone with his thoughts.  His pleasant smile slowly transformed into a pleased smirk.

“Teach *you* to drop me off in a crowd of zombies, Dick.""",/r/HFY/comments/kgkw9k/the_skethian_04/,4
97,ki7x5z,HFY,Tue Dec 22 17:54:27 2020,The big mistake,"In the year 2021, engineer Michael Porter finally got his request  approved, to work on the ELI–NP project. The ELI-NP derives from ""Extreme-Light Infrastructure - Nuclear Physics"", and, in simple terms, is the world's first ten petawatt laser in the world. Two years later, he came up with a theory to use this big ass laser as a way to send signals into space, but with such intensity, that the beam would pierce the fabric of the universe, and come out at a designated distance, faster than the speed of light. So, extremely long range, almost instant communication.

The advantages of such a technology were obvious, so NASA got involved. Since the ELI-NP laser was built in an underground facility, and not really meant for sending signals into space, NASA brought Michael Porter in Florida, and put him in charge of building another big laser, but this time, dedicated to put his theory into practice. Americans, being americans, decided to build an laser even stronger than the ELI-NP. So, the ""Extreme Long Range Extreme-Light Communicator"" (or ELR-ELI project) was born. The world's first 50 petawatt laser. Equipped with an advanced targeting system, that could compensate for Earth's rotation, for the target's speed, and so on, it could send a beam that could hit a nickel placed on the surface of the moon.

The most simple way to send data using the ELR-ELI, was Morse code. But there were other options. Like transmitting into binary, simply by converting the ON/OFF, into 0/1. Decimals, or Hexadecimals were also possible soon. So, we had a way to communicate, but...no one to communicate with.

Sure, we used this to communicate to rovers on Mars, to space missions, but still, we felt like Alexander Graham Bell must have felt like - we had a ""phone"", but no one to talk to.

So, the next step was  the following: we built a receiver - like a big satellite dish - around the ELR-ELI. When the ELR-ELI was not used to communicate to our own equipment (like Rovers, and shuttles), it was pointed at all the known planets we discovered, one at a time, and it would send a simple message (like ""Hello""), in binary, towards their surfaces. And we would listen for an response. We figured that if anyone would receive our signal, it would send back something similar, to the location of the transmitting device.

Two years it took to go through all the planets we knew about. When we finished transmitting to all the planets we had discovered so far, we also started to transmit to locations where we only suspected planets might be. We also sent signals in the spaces between the planets and stars, into the blackest void, aiming to reach beyond our observable Universe.

Years passed, technology advanced, other ELR-ELI devices were built, including one on our first colony, on Mars. Smaller similar devices were built. More efficient, designed just for the communications between Mars and Earth or between Earth and the space missions. The original ELR-ELI now had only one job - to send our ""Hello"" into space, and to listen for a reply.

It was the year 2059 when the reply came back. It was a similar signal - an Extreme-Light beam, broken into segments. It copied our original signal - the ""Hello"" we sent, in binary - and had some additional signal at the end, that we translated as ""2x2"". Amidst the chaos and excitement that broke out, we finally managed to send back the answer: ""4"".

So started our first communication with a race that called themselves the ""Ma-ri"". Right from the start it was clear that their technology was leaps and bounds ahead of ours. But it was also clear that they were friendly, and willing to share their knowledge with us. 

Communication was slow and frustrating via ELR-ELI, but because we were different species, binary remained the only language that both civilizations could understand. 

We started to exchange information about us. Among the first things exchanged, were the periodic tables from each civilization. As a result, we found out that they too were carbon based life forms. Apparently, they were smaller than us (about a quarter of our mass), and a bit different (4 legs and 4 arms), but their atmosphere was pretty similar in composition to ours. And, apparently, with their advanced medicine, they had a span of life of 600 years on average! This discussion lead to the first ""present"" we received from the Ma-ri. They sent us a very complicated chemical formula, but only with elements from our periodic table. 

The Ma-ri were declared ""unconditional allies"" when our scientists discovered that the formula was for a very interesting substance, that would cure cancer, amongst other 20 or so diseases that still plagued our civilization.

After this, came ideas for clean energy, formulas for new types of building materials. Lighter, stronger and more durable. They sent a map of the stars between them and us. They sent us ways to accelerate the terraforming of Mars. It was like they couldn't send us all they knew fast enough. And we couldn't decipher all the information that was coming fast enough. We had thousands of scientist, from all over the world, working on all the information they were sending.

The communication was so slow, and the volume of information so large, that many mistakes were made. From deciphering wrong, to overlapping of projects, to missing bytes caused by different cosmic events. One passing comet between Earth and their planet caused such a distortion of the message, that instead of the formula for a material that could be used for space ships windows, what we received and deciphered, was a formula for some type of bio-degradable  styrofoam.

Ten years after we made contact via ""phone"" with them, we asked them for a way to make the communication faster. We asked them to meet us. They responded that while they did have FTL ships, but they cannot spare one at the moment to make the journey towards us. Even with their fastest ship, they calculated it would take almost an year for the trip between us. And, apparently, they were engaged in a war, and all ships and resources were directed towards the war effort.

This news, about the Ma-ri being at war, got the world's leaders into the mother of all turmoil. All talk about ""unconditional allies"" was forgot. All information transmitted towards them was stopped. The teams of scientists working on the data that we had from the Ma-ri, now all had at least two military observers each. Paranoia was starting to rise it's ugly head. Alarmist questions and conspiracy theories were running rampant.  ""What if we are next?"". ""It was mistake to send that signal into space!"". ""They want us to develop the Earth, to do all the work, and after that they will come and take it from us!"". ""The cure for cancer causes autism!"". And so on... 

Thankfully, not everyone panicked. The chief scientist in charge of project ELR-ELI, sent back a simple question: ""Who are you fighting, and why?"".

The answer that came back was ...expansive. Ten years ago, we were the first life form outside their system that they ever contacted. Or, to be fair, that contacted them. They intercepted our signal by chance, with one of their planet's satellite. Then, they made a device similar to our ELR-ELI, to answer us. And, even copied our method of calling in the dark, searching for other civilizations. With their more advanced technology, they achieved results faster than us. In less than a year after they started broadcasting into the dark, they received an answer. But it was not a friendly ""Hello"". It was a fleet of hollowed asteroids. Inside - swarms of bug like creatures. On the surfaces of the meteors - giant plasma spewing bugs acted as ship-to-ship weapons and propulsion. A race of all-consuming roaches had found them, tracking their signal, and was set on devouring them, and everything on that lived on their planets. All attempts of communications were rebuked by the bugs. They were merciless and implacable. Their preferred method of attack was to crush into the Ma-ri ships, pierce their hulls, and swarm them with overwhelming numbers. Then, using those ships, to land on the planets bellow, and to start their cycle of eating and multiplying, until everything was consumed. After that, to break the planet into meteor like chunks, and lunch themselves again in space, in search of other planets. 

Now, about eight years into the fight for their survival, the Ma-ri were down to one single planet - their home world.  They will survive as long as possible, but the chances for them to repel this voracious enemy were almost zero. They will continue to send us all their knowledge, so that we could have a fighting chance if the bugs ever find us too. 

The message ended with a question: ""Would you like to know more?""

If, before this message, we were afraid, now we were afraid AND ashamed.  But now we had an enemy. And our ""unconditional allies"" were on the verge of extinction. The people that started a new golden age of science on Earth, were dying (for eight years now), and never asked us for anything. Instead, they gave us all they could.

We asked them for weapons, ships, engines designs. We asked them for FTL. We asked for everything we thought that could give us a chance against those bugs. And we promised them that the first war ship we will make by these designs will come to their aid, filled with volunteers. 

That must have elicited some bitter smiles from their part. They answered that they already lost close to 5.000 ships. One more ship would not make any difference. ""Stay safe"", they transmitted. ""Stay safe,  grow strong, and don't repeat our mistake of trusting that the universe is as kind and friendly as you are"".

Still, they began transmitting us all the data we needed for an FTL engine, for ship-to-ship weapons, ship designs, formula for hull materials, air recycling engine, and what-not. So much data, that all other projects were put on hold. Everyone was working on deciphering the data needed for the ship; ship that we arrogantly named ""Cavalry"". Thousands of contractor were hired to build it. It was a project that united the world. A futile gesture probably, but a gesture to express our gratitude for all the Ma-ri had done for us.

The ""Cavalry"" started to be built even before all the information about it finished coming through. Sure, errors were bound to happen. Like after we started building the hull, the airlocks seemed to big , and not compatible with our other ships and space stations. So we corrected them, and made them smaller. Living quarters - again - they were too big and comfortable. A waste of space... Storage for weapons it is then! The main weapons of the ship seemed kind of weak. Like it would take some time to pierce a hull like this. So we made them bigger. Maybe that's a human thing... There is no such thing as an ""overkill"" when it comes to bugs. So we added other type of weapons too. There was so much unused space all around the hull, ready to be filled with weapons. From a sleek, smooth surfaced hull, we made a hedgehog of a ship, bristling with weapons. Rail guns, missile ports, point defenses. Also, some nukes, because... because ""fuck bugs"", that's why.

Life supporting system - we had to basically install like ten of them , to ensure that it could sustain the crew. We knew that they were smaller than us, and obviously consumed less air, water, food, but we had to install ten of everything that was related to life support. Air filtering pumps, water recycling, hydroponics - all these we had to expand and multiply. Luckily the design of the ship was spacious enough that we had room for everything. 

In six months, ""Cavalry"" was launched. It had a crew of 1350, all volunteers. Total length was almost 800m. With a hull from the new lighter material, it still had 120.500 tons.

It had taken quite a toll on our resources as a planet, but there was not a human on the entire Earth (and Mars) that did not feel filled with pride as the cameras transmitted the launch around the planet. We watched with tears in our eyes as the ""Cavalry"" galloped towards our friends, the Ma-ri.

Our friends said that the trip between our planets would take almost an year. But the ""Cavalry"" pushed it's engines to the maximum. The trip lasted only four months. Maybe the initial estimate was based on older type of engine, maybe our modifications made the engines better - the reason was not yet clear, but everyone sighted with relief when the ""Cavalry"" finally arrived into the Ma-ri system, and found Ma-ri ships still fighting around their home planet, facing what looked like a cloud of meteors. 

It was a strange kind of battle, with the sleek Ma-ri ships constantly dodging the meteorites, and their bug plasma spews, while trying to coordinate their fire, two or three at a time, against one single meteorite. Even if the Ma-ri ships were clearly more maneuverable then the bug infested meteorites, the sheer number of enemies was so great that the cloud of meteorites was actually chasing the ships and pushing them towards the Ma-ri planet.

The ""Cavalry"" didn't waste any time or thought. It accelerated towards the meteorite cloud, all weapons hot. It reached weapons range in two minutes flat and began spitting missiles, rail gun slugs, and high powered laser beams like the wrath of God. It took full advantage of the element of surprise, and droved straight through the cloud of meteors, getting even the point defenses in range, and firing those guns too. It came out the other side of the cloud, after cracking three of the larger meteors, and countless other smaller ones.  The space between the meteors was now filled with debris, bugs, and various bug remain. No meteor had successfully crushed into the ""Cavalry""'s hull.  The human ship turned, and made another strafing run by the enemy formation, this time keeping on the edge of the meteor cloud. A few plasma shots from the bugs managed to hit them, though, but they did not penetrate the hull. It just corroded about half an inch deep of the surface. The hull was 20 inch thick, so it was in no immediate danger. That did not mean that the captain was not pissed as hell that the bugs dirtied his brand new ship. He initiated a transmission on all available channels towards the Ma-ri ships to stand back, and gave the order to launch nuke number one, pet named ""Gaia"". 

The missile with the nuke looked no different than any of the dozens other missiles launches in the same instant by the ""Cavalry"". It beelined straight towards the biggest meteorite in the cloud, impacted in a cloud of red fire and red dust, followed by a beautiful, visible shockwave that turned to dust all the meteors in the immediate area. Cheers went out on the human ship, as almost half of the remaining enemies were pulverized or at least cracked. 

Not wanting to leave the enemy a chance to sober up, the ""Cavalry"" charged once more into the fray. The Ma-ri ships, invigorated by this shift of power joined the fray and followed in the ""Cavalry""'s wake. 

This is when the human captain noticed that the surviving Ma-ri ships were only small ones. Barely corvette type, if even that. The ""Cavalry"" would pass by the enemies, hit like a sledge hammer, cracking and pulverizing all the bigger meteors, and in it's wake, the Ma-ri ships would nimbly concentrate their fire on the still active enemies, giving the finishing blows, with surgical precision. 

Two hours later, the meteors were all cracked and emptied of their fouls contents and for the first time in more than ten years, the humans and the Ma-ri managed to open a communication channel with audio, and video. 

After all the pleasantries were exchanged, in the excited discussions that followed, the humans found out with horror that a REALLY big mistake was made. When receiving and deciphering the instructions for the ship, due to our communication, switching from binary to hexadecimal, and back, we  ended up multiplying everything about the hull by 16. Sixteen times bigger. Sixteen times thicker. And from this - everything about the ship was modified. This explained all the extra space inside. The need for ten times more life supporting systems. All the space on the hull for extra weapons ports. Everything made sense now. A big mistake, an expensive mistake, but in the end, a happy one. The commander of the ""Cavalry"", just made a series of grunts, from which the crew managed to understand that ""Huh... I guess size does matter...""",/r/HFY/comments/ki7x5z/the_big_mistake/,33
8,kkrn8x,HFY,Sun Dec 27 00:43:51 2020,Stolen Valor - Part 2,"Well, I really meant to get this out sooner, but I had finals, then the holidays, plus I'm just lazy! Sorry about that. Anyway, here is part two!

[Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/k8qf0n/stolen_valor/)

(Also, this is the first time I've tried to link a post, so let me know if it doesn't work!)

&amp;#x200B;

I glared at the beetle hybrid, and stood up from what the couch. “I have no idea what could have possibly conspired between my people and yours, but in any case, you aren’t a Human. I am a human, and you don’t look even slightly similar. Also, we aren’t your ancestors! When I left for my mission that so gracefully dumped me in your presence, we had never even heard of something like you, I would have known!” 

The circular couch was wide, maybe 5 feet or so separated me and Stttreng from where he was sitting on the other side. I took a step away from the couch, and he stood and matched my posture.

“I will NOT stand for this type of insolence and clear disregard for your betters!” Stttreng had a gravely voice that sounded like he was gargling glass, “Sit down whatever you are, lest you make me prove to you my prowess above you!” 

He sounded serious, but didn’t really look like it. Being only 5 feet tall or so, it looked more like an angry pre-teen was threatening me with bodily harm. It would have been comical if it wasn’t, in fact, a threat. But it was, and I had enough. He was claiming to be a Human, which again would have been funny if he weren’t serious. He had then threatened me and was going to ‘prove his prowess.’ I turned back to the couch to gauge the reactions of Va’Ska and KARM, and the look on Va’Ska’s face and KARM’s dancing lights didn’t look encouraging, I’d even wager they were afraid of this little runt!

“Alrighty then pal, I was just going to pace a little bit but now it seems you want to wrestle. I recommend you sit back down and let me work off some steam, but you seem dead set against that. One warning is all I’m gonna give. Don’t think just because you all somehow gave me the ability to understand you that I’m all peachy with this situation.” I swapped my gaze back to Stttreng, and struck him with the most threatening look I could muster. 

It made no difference. He growled and advanced the few feet to get in reach of me, and swung his short stubby left arm at my gut. Since his arms were so short, he was well within my reach at the time, and all I had to do was step back and let loose a quick jab. I aimed for the side of his head, looking to get in a light strike, but he ducked at the last second, and what would have been a light hit turned into a love tap on his horn. I was off balance and jumping back, so the blow was basically negligible in force. Turns out, that was all I needed. His horn shattered with the force of a glancing blow, if that. He screamed bloody murder and fell to the ground as his once proud antler/horn things were suddenly halved in number. With his scream, the door opened and a squad of guards rushed in, weapons ready. 

Since Stttreng had mentioned that his kind were the soldiers of the coalition, I noticed that the guard squad was all Skagan troops. Interesting enough, they didn’t seem very happy with me. I wonder why? 

“Kill this fool!” Stttreng shouted from his position on the floor, waving one stubby arm in my direction. 

Va’Ska and KARM barely had a chance to voice their disagreement this whole time, and they didn’t have one now before the guards opened fire on me.

Now, have any of you played paintball before? I have, when I was a kid we used to go play out in the woods. Had our own compressor and everything, it was a pretty nice setup for a group of teenagers to have put together themselves. We had a lot of good times back then, and I was suddenly whisked back down memory lane when I realized that the guns these aliens were firing at me felt particularly like a paintball. 

I could have retreated behind the couch, but I didn’t want the other two aliens to come under more fire than they already have, so I only had one option. Reacting probably not how they thought I would, I covered my face (still was bad news to get shot in the eye) and charged the guards bunched up in the doorway. As I launched at them over the 15 feet or so, I felt a lot more impacts hit up and down my body, but this was nothing I haven’t felt before in heated matches. My shoulder connected with the first unlucky S.O.B., and I felt a large crunch that wasn’t on my end. I heard a squeak from the guard I had just hit, and some screams from the others when I kept flying through them. These guys were pretty lightweight, and the fact I ended up in the hallway with 4 or 5 guards all uncomfortably holding my weight was testament to that. I shuffled my way off of their broken bodies, and took a glance around. The soldiers that had so bravely tried to execute me were all lying on the ground groaning in pain. Great! That meant they were still alive and I had not committed manslaughter with a tackle that any high-school football player could have shrugged off! Especially with the armor the Skagans were wearing, it looked pretty heavy duty, but it apparently didn’t amount to much. Compared to that, my flight suit didn’t offer any protection from combat at all, but all I was left with was a myriad of bruises that I’m sure were forming. 

It all kinda hit me then, had these guys been trying to kill me? Shit! I went right from ‘honored guest’ to guillotine fodder in a matter of seconds, all because some dipshit bug thought he was a human! I turned back towards the room to see three very distressed aliens looking back at me. Va’Ska and KARM were positively shaking with fear, and Stttreng was sitting on the ground where I left him in opened-mouthed shock. I stalked back inside to confront this asshole again. 

“Please don’t kill us!” Va’Ska and KARM pleaded at the same time once my gaze had shifted back over upon them, “We didn’t know he would do that! Please spare us!”

Huh? Obviously they had just seen me wipe out a squad with a shoulder charge, and obviously I wasn’t very happy about this turn of events, but why would I kill them?

“Why would I kill you? You guys didn’t do anything, it was this imposter that started everything!” I gestured to Stttreng still sitting dumbfounded on the ground, “I’m not gonna kill anyone, I just had to defend myself!” 

“Wh-wh-what? You mean you aren’t mad? We thought you were going to execute Stttreng!” Va’Ska had spoken up again, still trembling.

“Of course I’m fucking mad! This asshole just tried to fight me, and called in a hit squad when he got his ass handed to him! I didn’t even hit him that hard, that was a quick jab on defense for god’s sake! You’d think I hit him with a sledgehammer the way his horn popped off, but that wasn’t my intent!

Yes, I’m quite upset with Stttreng here, but as far as I’m concerned you two are in the clear, it wasn’t like you tried to kill me after all.” I turned away from the two still quite perturbed aliens, and walked over to my good pal Stttreng.

“Stttreng old buddy, the ground is no place to sit when we have this comfy couch just waiting for us? How about I give you a lift?” I grabbed under his shoulders and made to hoist him up to the couch, when he decided that wasn’t very friendly of me. 

“Put me down this instant! Or I’ll-“

“Or you’ll what? I don’t think you have much bargaining power right now shithead, now sit down and we can discuss this like adults.”

I set him on the couch across from me. 

“Now, I’m gonna explain the current situation. You just provoked a fight. You lost very handily. You called in guards and ordered them to kill me. I didn’t die. I am going to give you another chance out of the kindness of my heart to explain yourself. Because at this point, It’s obvious you aren’t anything like a Human, no matter what bullshit you try and spew. If I hit a human like I hit you, he would have felt it, but nothing past that would have happened. Your guards weapons hurt less than a game I used to play for fun as a kid, and their heavy armor did nothing to stop their limb from being crushed into powder. I think I see a pattern here. But before you speak, I need a second opinion.”

I waved KARM and Va’Ska over. They stumbled over to stand in away from both myself and Stttreng. “Are these guys really the strongest soldiers out there? Those weapons the most dangerous?” I asked the only two people I met that hadn’t turned hostile. KARM spoke up first.

“Yes to the soldiers, the Humans of Skagan are the most feared and durable soldiers the coalition can produce, they are known far and wide for being almost unkillable in direct combat. Those weapons, on the other hand, are not the most powerful thing they field, but are very effective on a general basis, and are very popular with pirate factions for being very deadly in close quarters combat.” 

Wow. That’s good to know! I am officially the most badass person in space if that’s the pinnacle I have to compare to. I’ll still try not to get shot in the future though. 

“Thanks KARM, Va’Ska, do you need to call someone about the poor injured souls out there?”

“Yes we probably should, we did not know if you would allow them to be treated, so we have held off.”

“Yeah get them some medical attention, I don’t really have a personal problem with them, they were following orders after all, as long as they don’t try for round 2, I don’t have a problem.”

“Thank you for sparing them.” And with that, KARM and Va’Ska departed, and I was left alone with Stttreng. Or rather, he was left alone with me. 

“So, there we have it. Anything you want to add to their depiction of you? You are supposed to be the most powerful beings out here right? What happened to that when I broke your shit? A fluke? Trickery?”

Stttreng spoke up, “You really are a Human aren’t you?” Calling him distressed would be the understatement of the millennia. “We know we aren’t humans, but we thought we were the closest living thing! Long ago, before we had even reached the stars, a giant ship came crashing down on our soil. As the legends go, it was a Human ship. The ship was empty, but had vast bounties of technology and resources that helped turn my people from ignorant savages into the most feared force in the galaxy. There was evidence of another race that once lived on the ship, but we never found any bodies. The depiction of them was similar to us, a head, torso, two arms and legs, and so on. So once we reached the stars we convinced the other races that we had built the ship, and we were its people. We still keep replications of the holy prints on the side of the great vessel, to remember the great luck we had that we were chosen to benefit from the ship’s destress. Now everyone in the galaxy knows of the Humans, that’s why those two were so scared. Nobody has ever met a real Human before, they thought we were the humans. Now they know different.” He was sullen after recounting this history lesson to me. I made no attempt to discourage this helpful behavior. 

“Do you have these prints handy?”

“Yes, I always keep copies on me.” He suddenly had a bit more respect and deference in his voice. 

He grabbed two pictures out of a pocket in his coat thing, and handed them to me gently.

I stared, eyes wide at the prints he had handed to me. One was an American Flag, painted on the side of the ship. The other, words. They read: ARK PHOENIX - NASA. 

I didn’t know of any Ark project in the works when I left, and I could estimate the size of the ship from the pictures, It was the most massive building I think humans had ever put together. That would have taken a lot of time to put together. How long have I been drifting?",/r/HFY/comments/kkrn8x/stolen_valor_part_2/,15

""*Fuck that.*"" Cassius declared, ""You want to be the big man? You deal with this thing your own damn self. The hell do you even expect me to do?""

I gestured to where my weapons leaned, just inside the door of the mill, ""I've got the axe, you can take the rifle. You don't even need to hit the thing, just make sure the rounds don't end up in my back.""

""I don't know how the hell to use a gun,"" he protested.

""What do you mean you don't know how to use a gun? You're, you know, American.""

""An American, from *Oakland.*""

""It's not like I can get one of the villagers to use it, and it's only going to do me so much good,"" I insisted, ""I can't shoot and hold the axe at the same time, and if I need to reach out and touch someone I can use magic. Look, I'm not asking you to help me fight the thing. I just need someone to watch my back, and I can't trust any of the villagers to do that.""

""Alright, fine. I'll help,"" he relented, ""But I'm still not sure how you plan to catch this thing.""

""The monster only comes out when it's properly dark. Today's Dark Even', which means it'll have been a few days since its last chance to hunt. It'll also need to strike before the gas giant comes back out, which'll be around midnight. We cast the wallhack spell I figured out yesterday, and watch over the animals this evening. I've already talked to the villagers. They'll have them all in the same field. Not super close together, but near enough we can watch them all.""

""I thought the range on the spell was pretty limited?"" he frowned, ""You only picked up on Rolf coming down the road when he was twenty or thirty yards away.""

""We can just pump more mana into it. I've done something similar with Sense Electricity, all it takes is more juice. I brought some pearls with me. We can use those.""

""And once the fugly monster shows up?""

""We just shoot the thing. Either it'll be dead right there, or wounded enough for us to chase it down and finish it off.""

""I dunno man, you seem pretty optimistic about this whole thing. This seems more like a boss fight than some side quest.""

""Maybe you're right,"" I granted him, ""But whatever we're going up against isn't going to have any context for either guns or magic, and we've got both. Besides, this thing is skulking around, snatching up goats and sheep. We've got a better chance of finding a bunch of mangey coyotes preying upon the flock than some man-eating lion.

---

""Wally?""

""Yeah?""

""I don't know about you, man, but that looks a hell of a lot like a lion.""

Cassius and I were concealed in the bushes atop a small rise, overlooking a field of scrubby grass. It was high enough not to be swept clean by the daily tides, but since landing here, the villagers hadn't the time to clear it for farming. There were stumps spread here and there, left from them harvesting firewood, along with a scattering of variously sized stones that had proved too troublesome to move.

The sheep were out in the open, though took some shelter from the wind in a small depression by the base of the hill. The goats were huddled among one of the larger rock clusters, though some had strayed into the nearby copse. We'd had our eye on it since settling into our position, as it stood at the very edge of the village's safe territory. And sure enough, shortly after a light rain began to fall, a few of the goats had strayed into the trees to shelter from the weather.

And damn if the beast stalking them didn't look exactly like a lion.

With the cloud cover blocking out what little starlight there was, and camouflaged by the trees, I could see only its outline as illuminated by the Sense Body spell. 

Even in silhouette, I could make out the muscles rippling under the skin of its legs and back, as well as the deep chest and sizeable blunt-featured head. A thick mane hid its short neck, and the creature stalked low to the ground as it advanced through the brush towards one of the goats.

""Have you got a clear shot?"" I whispered.

""Nah, here,"" he replied, offering me the rifle, ""Trees are in the way.""

I set my axe aside and sighted down the scope. I could see a little better with the optics, as the magnification brought more light into my eye, but it only did so much without a night vision setting.

With the blue silhouette to guide me in, I found the target with ease, but it was as Cassius had said. I could see just well enough to realize this wasn't going to work. The rounds the rifle used were pretty heavy, not quite big game, but on par with what most militaries would use in a marksman or sniper rifle. So I was pretty confident that the rounds would make it through the tree trunks. I was less sure, however, that they'd have the effect I wanted.

It was a damn big lion, after all. Nearly as long in the body as I was tall, it was almost twice the size of anything you're likely to see in the zoo. Even if the rounds made it through the trees without being deflected, it was possible they'd lose too much energy to do any good.

I passed the rifle back to Cassius and once again laid my hand upon my axe.

""What's the plan?"" he whispered.

""We try to shoot this thing, and we'll just piss it off, and I don't want it knowing we're after it,"" I explained, ""We're going to let it grab one of the goats, and then follow it home. Once it starts digging into the goat, we'll pounce.""

I heard Cassius sigh, ""Really? *Pounce?*""

""Shut up and follow me down the damn hill.""

---

Though there was a little wind, I trusted the rain to keep our scent from carrying as we approached.

We'd just made it down the slope and were passing by where the sheep sheltered when we heard an animal scream. The sheep bolted up the hill, and the two of us quickened our pace as much as we dared, concerned as much by discovery as we were the rough terrain.

Now that we were level with the rest of the animals, they obscured the outline of the lion and its prey, hiding from view what transpired. I caught Cassius's arm and pulled him behind one of the larger boulders as the goats came streaming past, flowing around the rocks like a stream over rapids.

Cassius and I pushed our way through the last of the animals, and as the swirling outlines cleared, I was able to fix my gaze upon the shape of the lion and its prey.

The lion's outline went fuzzy around the middle, from about the shoulders to just above the hips, as it wrestled with the goat. Rather than taking the corpse up in its jaws, the lion lifted with its forepaws and began taking bounding leaps with the carcass clutched in its claws.

It was neither quick nor graceful, affording us plenty of time to catch up as it bowled its way through the trees and down the slope. 

With the pearls I'd brought we'd each put enough power into the tracking spell to give us a fair amount of range, which allowed us to apply a little more strategy than if we'd been tracking by simple sight and sound. With the lion making enough noise to cover our movements, we'd wait for it to pass a promising bit of cover, then advance quickly up to the new position.

Leapfrogging from cover to cover also allowed us the chance to rest and catch our breath, while the lion seemed happy to tire itself out.

""The hell?"" Cassius whispered, ""Did this thing get dropped on its head as a cub? Are we hunting a handicapped lion?""

I leaned my shoulder against the rough bark of the tree we hid behind, and adjusted my grip on the axe, ""Maybe it's injured?"" I guessed, ""You think the villagers took a shot at it and didn't tell us?""

I heard a rustling of cloth as Cassius shrugged, ""Dunno, come on, time to move.""

I'd seen flashes of movement here and there as the spell outlined various animals. Mostly birds and squirrels that took the hell off the moment they heard the lion battering its way through the wilderness. But as we found ourselves beginning to advance up a gentle slope, a mess of cluttered shapes popped into sight some distance up the hill. 

I couldn't make sense of it. It looked like several small shapes overlaid atop each other, but the lion seemed to be heading for its general direction.

We waited for the creature to crest the rise before advancing up the hill, finally stopping just below the top of the hill to listen. The creature didn't go much further, only a few more of its bounding leaps. And this time the sound took on a flat, echoing quality.

""It's stopping, maybe a cave?"" Cassius asked, daring to peek his head above the rise.

""Come on,"" I prompted, backing slightly down the hill, ""We'll come around from the side.""

He followed as I retreated slightly, and we jogged about a hundred yards around to the right before summiting the hill and coming back around. We crossed over the cluttered shapes on our way back, and it became evident that whatever the shapes were, they were below ground.

I knelt and felt at the earth, finding it loose.

""Man, that's a fucking lot of bones,"" Cassius murmured, standing beside me.

""You ever hear of a lion burying its kills?""

""Nah, doesn't make any sorta sense. Lion don't care. They leave what they don't want for hyenas or whatever.""

""That's probably why it's burying the remains.""

""Trying to keep vultures away?""

""Yeah, but as you said, a lion wouldn't do that. Makes me wonder just what it is we're chasing.""

""Then how are we taking this thing down if we don't know what it is? We're going to have a real bad time if we get in there with it, only to find out the motherfucker breaths fire or spits acid.""

I pondered it for a moment, before shaking my head, ""It's intelligent.""

I felt around in my pocket and pulled a couple of coins free from the roll and tucked a couple into each hand, holding them against the haft of my long axe.

""If it charges, I'll open up with magic. Maybe you take a shot at it with the rifle. But if you're not sure, or if it doesn't attack, hold your fire.""

""You're gonna try to talk to this fuckin' thing?""

""If it's intelligent enough to speak, then yeah, it deserves a chance. I don't mind putting down an animal that's going after the village's livelihood. But if it's an intelligent creature stealing to feed itself, then we should hear it out.""

I heard Cassius let out a breath, and by his blue outline saw him nod, ""Fair enough,"" he agreed.

---

Walking along with the rocky outcropping to our right, we almost missed the cave the first time, the opening lost in the jagged shadows that were all one could make out against the dark stone.

Deep within, we could hear the creature digging into the goat, though it lacked the ravenous abandon I'd been expecting. Instead, it seemed more like it was all the beast could do to choke down the raw meat.

There was no light within, but I sensed that we were moving from a narrow corridor and out into an open chamber by the way the sound echoed.

My eyes were all but useless, and I couldn't even see my feet. It gave the impression of floating in a black void, and I felt a sudden rush of vertigo. I knew, consciously, how close I was. I remembered how large the outline of the creature had appeared against the landscape outside. But now, without a single point of reference to go by, it felt as if the hovering outline of the monster could have been inches from my nose, or miles distant.

I placed a hand on the wall of the cavern, the feel of damp earth against my fingertips, and steadied myself. With the coins still clutched in hand, I raised it, only slightly, towards the creature.

""Ahem,"" I uttered quietly.

The creature froze, and then slowly turned its head toward us.

""So, uh, how are you doing?""

""*Are you kidding me right now?*"" the big man squeaked.

""Hush,"" I hissed, ""I got this.""

The creature spoke, its voice dusky and feminine, with a deepness that belied not so much age, as power, ""What always runs but never walks, often murmurs, never talks, had a bed but never-""

""A river,"" I supplied.

The creature paused, and then rose to all fours. Turning away from its meal, it faced the two of us, and spoke again, ""Four brothers visit this land, the first is welcomed with joy, the second is beloved, the third always brings sad tidings, and the last is feared. They visit each year-""

""The seasons,"" I answered, ""Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter, you're talking about the seasons.

There was a gust of wind and a flash of movement as the creature unfurled its wings and beat the air once, it's voice growing deeper and louder in the small space, ""What walks on four legs in the morning, two legs in the-""

""A man.""

Its wings beat the air once more, carrying the scent of blood to me, and its voice boomed, the frustration evident in its tone, ""There are two turtles-""

""Both of the turtles are blind,"" I replied with a yawn.

In my defence, I'd been up for a while and was getting pretty tired.

""*My turn,*"" I cheered, setting the coins aside to withdraw Val's torch, ""What has the body of a lion, the head of a human, the wings of an eagle, and likes telling riddles?""

I slowly turned the head of the torch, and a cold metallic light gradually grew to fill the room, revealing the creature standing before me. 

It was more or less as I'd described, with the body of a lion, enormous tawny wings, and the face of a beautiful woman. What I'd taken for a mane was instead a shock of extremely tangled red hair. Dark blood stained her mouth and chin.

""I will allow you to keep your life, but state your purpose with haste,"" the sphinx demanded.

""*Would you like,*"" I began eagerly, ""A bubble bath?""

I heard Cassius' palm smack his forehead, but I kept my gaze on the hot lion lady.

""I've not heard that one before,"" she replied.

""Oh, it's not a riddle,"" I informed her, ""It's just like a normal bath, but with bubbles.""

""*You can't be serious.*"" Cassius hissed.

I spread my arms, ""Bubble baths, great food, silk sheets,"" I recited, ""Just think about it.""

""You there, little human, what is wrong with the giant?""

Cassius threw up his hands and let out a strangled noise.

""Explain yourself, giant,"" she demanded, ""Why do you intrude my lair, speaking nonsense?""

""It's a long story, but it boils down to, the villagers will swear fealty to me if I deal with the monster that's been stealing their livestock. So we came around to see what was up. Then I realized you were intelligent, and I figured that instead of, you know, trying to kill each other, I could invite you to come hang out with us.""

The sphinx wiped her mouth with the back of her paw, and peered down at the blood that stained her fur with disgust, ""Am I to believe you are truly so eager to make alliance with me? When you first set off this night, doubtless you were ready to slay what you found preying upon the herd.""

I shrugged, ""You're sapient. Killing an animal is one thing, case in point,"" I added, nodding towards the half-eaten goat, ""But as long as you don't try to hurt me or anyone I care about, you're just another person that maybe needs a hand. Unless you want to hang out in a cave eating raw goat.""

The sphinx growled and beat the air, ""Do not taunt me, giant. I know what I am, I know I am a monster, and I am wise enough not to be fooled by honeyed words and enticing lies.""

""Mmm, *nah*,"" I mused, ""Not buying it. You don't think of yourself as a monster. I don't know what your homeworld is like, but no one thinks of themselves as the bad guy. Not even, I dunno, nazis. Sure, you're kinda scary and probably really dangerous. But so is a dude with a rifle-"" I hesitated, ""Right, a rifle is-""

""I know what a gun is, giant,"" the sphinx replied sourly.

 I frowned in confusion, ""You do?""

""I am not some mystical creature,"" she growled, ""I was engineered. You are looking at the key feature of the second day for most visitors to Dragon World.""

I felt suddenly sick. Here I was, ecstatic at meeting a creature out of the Monster Manual, happy to banter and argue with it, envisioning myself as the plucky Bard who talked the monster over to the party's side. And that had been precisely the point.

I considered what I saw in a new light, only now realizing how absurd it all was. Her wings, while impressive, were far too small to ever lift her off the ground. They were there for show, and little else. And there was the biomechanics to consider, a human head atop a lion's body with a set of wings tacked on? I thought my body was high maintenance, but I could only imagine what an overengineered mess her skeleton must look like, and the troubles she'd have as she aged. Then there were her paws. They looked every bit like those of a lion, perfectly fine for ripping and tearing, but entirely lacking in opposable thumbs. She'd never, for example, turn a doorknob or pick up a fork. From the look of her face and hair, she couldn't even clean herself properly.

I set the axe aside, put my coins away, and then pulled off my pack and set it infront of me. I dug around until I found my canteen and a cloth.

""Here,"" I soothed, wetting the cloth and approaching her, ""I'll have no more of this nonsense. We'll get you cleaned up, some proper food, make you feel like a person again.""

""Giant..."" she began slowly, drawing back as she raised a paw and extended her claws.

""Hey, hey, put those away,"" I chastised, gesturing with the cloth, ""We both know you're not going to hurt me. Come here and let me help you.""

She squirmed only slightly as I wiped the blood from her face and neck, and didn't protest further.

""You would really take me into your home?"" she asked quietly, her eyes averted, ""A creature such as myself?""

""As long as you promise not to bite anyone who doesn't bite you first, sure,"" I agreed warmly, ""I'm Wallace, by the way.""

""Regina,"" she said softly.

""Name's Cassius,"" Cassie offered, ""And I'm sorry about before. I was a bit of a dick.""

""You weren't to know,"" Regina allowed

""Just one problem, what do we tell the chieftain?"" Cassius asked, ""And where are we spending the night?""

""I think we're going to get the chance to tell him sooner rather than later,"" I grimaced.

I'd returned my gaze to Cassius as he'd spoke, and in so doing, spotted the crowd of silhouettes ascending the hill behind him.

Cassius whirled, ""*Fuck.* They're pulling some shit, aren't they?""

Regina's hair bristled, and her gaze flitted between the two of us, confusion on her face, ""Explain.""

I waved a hand vaguely, ""Magic,"" I explained, ""We can see them through the ground. Trouble is, Rolf said his people were too afraid to go after you and they didn't say a damn thing about helping out. And now here's a crowd of them coming to join the party.""

""Must have followed us,"" Cassius nodded, ""The hell do we do?""

""I don't want to get trapped in this cave. Come on. We'll meet them as they reach the top. Regina, once we get out of here, you break left, find somewhere to hide. Let's hope we can talk our way out of this. Otherwise, I'd appreciate it if you could help, Regina.""

""I will do what I can,"" she agreed.

---

I shut off and pocketed the torch before exiting the tunnel, and went with Cassius to meet the approaching villagers. Though before we'd even reached the crest of the hill, we saw the group split into thirds. The main group, led by Rolf and his buddy with the shield, came straight up the hill while the other two circled wide.

A glance to the left told me that Regina was far enough out not to be caught up in the circle. Indeed, if it did come to a fight, which was looking more and more likely, she'd be well-positioned to tear into that flank.

""Those sons a bitches,"" Cassius muttered, ""They're here to kill us.""

""Or finish off the monster,"" I offered, ""Either way, they didn't plan on us making it out of here.""

He winced, ""Man, I don't want to shoot all these guys.""

""I don't know that they're going to give us much of a choice. Regina's got their left flank, you take right. Just hide somewhere till it kicks off. That thing is loud as hell,"" I told him, nodding towards the rifle, ""And they've never faced anything like it. If we're lucky, they'll break and run, and we won't have to hurt too many of them.""

""Goddammit, fine, just try not to get yourself dead.""

He unlimbered the rifle and went to find a firing position, while I straightened, and walked to the crest of the hill.

""*Ho,* Wallace,"" Rolf bellowed once he spotted me, ""Do you fare well? What of the monster?""

""Dead,"" I called back down to his group.

I counted a dozen men, Rolf included. Each man aside from the chieftain carried a spear a little shorter than themselves, the stone tips catching what little light there was. Only the chieftain's bodyguard bore a shield strapped to his arm. As for Rolf, he still wore his sword, as well as a shield across his back.

While the spell outlined their body, the same could not be said for their weaponry, though being able to see their posture so clearly helped guide my eyes as they filled in the remaining details. It wasn't anywhere near as useful as proper night vision, but it was more than any of them would have.

""Fantastic, what of Shaper?"" the chieftain called.

""Oh, monster got him.""

""Ah, well that's too bad."" Rolf sighed, ""Not a quick death, I imagine,"" the chieftain drew his sword, gesturing at me with it, ""We'll feast to your memory.""
 
I adjusted my grip on the axe, noting the feel of each coin I had pressed against the haft.

""So this was always the plan?"" I asked tiredly, ""Was peace never an option?""

""My daughter, nosy little thing, was listening,"" Rolf laughed, ""She told me what the two of you thought of us,"" he shook his head, ""But it truly made little difference, you were a fool to believe I'd get down on my knees for the first foreign chief to come through my lands.""

Rolf raised his sword and gave a cry that was quickly taken up by the rest of his group, followed a moment later by the men on the flanks. And cut immediately short by the roar of a lion and the crackle of rifle fire.

I focused on the coins under my left hand and drew in the mana, then opened my right hand, sending the coins forth like a burst of shrapnel from a claymore.

The men cried out, the momentum of their charge broken, and two of the men went down clutching at bloody wounds in their face and chest.

I roared and threw myself at the crowd. Not into their centre, but at the right end of the line. The man there thrust his spear at me, but I threw the attack aside with the butt of my axe, then swung it back to bury the blade in his shoulder. 

He screamed like a man broken, and I put my boot against his chest to get the needed leverage and tore my weapon free with a scream of fury.

I took two stumbling steps back before finding the footing to steady myself on the uneven ground.

The tactic worked, and now instead of meeting me as a group, they were busy fighting to get around each other. The first two men to get around their fallen comrade came at me cautiously, weapons up, ready to catch my attack on the haft as I'd just done.

I roared again, and struck at the man on the left, bringing the axe's beak down in a high right to left strike. He brought his weapon in line to parry, just as his companion dodged aside. But with so much mass and momentum behind my swing, I blew right through his block, bringing the beak down to shatter his shoulder. I kept my gaze on him just long enough to see his arm go limp, his weapon start to fall, before shifting my weight to the right and reversing my grip on the axe. 

The change in positioning effectively put the axe's head over my left shoulder, the haft held high. I swung across my body, lunging forwards as I did, at the man who'd dodged.

As expected, he'd dodged again, and that proved fatal. If he'd stayed, tried to block perhaps, again I would have smashed through it. But at the very least he would have caught the haft of my axe on his side. Ribs would break, he'd likely go down, but he might have lived. Instead, he'd stepped back into the path of the broad blade, and it sunk deep into his side.

He tried to scream, but when he opened his mouth, only a raspy wheeze emerged.

I took a wide stance and jerked the axe free, turning it into a clumsy right to left horizontal swing that caught only air, but served to drive back the trio of men going for my side.

""*Flee or die,*"" I bellowed, ""*Flee or die.*""

The three men came at me in unison, stabbing forward with their spears. I thrust forwards with the top spike in the same instant, leaning back, and letting go with my forehand as I did. The stone speartips met only air, while the steel spike atop my axe tore into the centre man, just under the ribs.

I pulled my axe back in a flash, once again taking it in two hands, and bellowed again, ""***Flee or die,***"" as the man fell.

I could still hear Regina's roars, but the rifle fire had died down from its rapid staccato to a single shot now and then.

While men pushed in to fill the gap I'd made and fill out the line, they looked as if they were just about ready to take my offer. It was then the chieftain and his shield-bearer charged, coming around the formation to strike at my flanks. The shield-bearer came from the left, up the slope, while the chieftain came at my right, from down the hill.

Rather than allowing them to encircle me, I threw myself at the chieftain, axe across my body in something like a cross-check, twisting as I did to catch the blade of his upraised sword on the haft.

I tried to stop my momentum, to turn and face the attack I knew would be coming at my back, but lost my footing, and both of us went tumbling down. I landed atop him, axe still held across my body, and I heard something crack. 

We skidded to a halt about halfway down, and I threw myself to my feet, whirling to face the remaining men. They hadn't moved. Their chieftain was at my feet, his head twisted at an impossible angle, and his shoulders and upper torso crushed when my weight had come down upon him. The blade of his sword shone dully, dropped near where I'd first crashed into him.

""Flee, or die,"" I said simply.

At first, I wasn't sure the shield-bearer would break and run, but then the others in his group began to notice the men in the flanking teams streaming down the hill, fleeing from Cassius and Regina. They began to edge backwards, and once he saw the wind begin to shift, the shield-bearer called a retreat. I gave the men space as they retrieved the dropped sword and edged around me. They didn't take their eyes off me until they'd put a good two hundred yards between us.

""Cassius, Regina,"" I called, trudging back up the hill, ""You guys okay?""

""Okay? Nah man, I'm pretty fucking far from okay,"" Cassius retorted as he emerged from the brush, ""I just killed like three people.""

Regina was nearly silent as she joined us in the clearing, though I could see her favouring her front right leg.

""Do not weep for them,"" she intoned, ""They'd have killed each of us, given a chance.""

I lit Val's torch, and swept it over Regina, revealing a bloody gash in what would have been a bicep in a humanoid.

""Lay down,"" I told the sphinx, ""I'll get that cleaned up, and then we can beat feet.""

Cassius spread his arms, ""Where the hell are we going exactly?""

Regina laid down, turning slightly to give me easier access to the wound, ""We certainly cannot remain here,"" she pointed out, ""They will return for their dead, come morning, and in greater numbers.""

""We've got time, not a whole lot, but enough. We've got about eight hours, little less, to cover around thirty miles. The gas giant'll be out in another two, and the light should help, but we've got to set out *now*. Are you going to be okay to walk?"" I asked Regina.

""You need only ensure the wound does not become infected. I assure you I can keep up.""

I finished washing my hands as best I could with the canteen, and set to work on the wound, ""I just hope Val's had better luck.""",/r/HFY/comments/klz758/meet_the_freak_25/,26
17,kmeq5a,HFY,Tue Dec 29 15:47:45 2020,A quick memo pertaining to human employment,"Measurements converted to local approximations.

Since humans have been discovered and the vaccines for the more common diseases modified for their biology we're going to start seeing humans on ships and stations. Here's a few brief things to keep in mind if you are thinking about hiring a human/have a human passenger/work with a human.

Food: Humans are quite possibly the most omnivorous known sapient species. While many of the things they eat are just fine for your consumption, many are not. Gluten is in high quantities in their foods, salt and iron in absurd quantities, and capsaicin is a spice for them. Yes, capsaicin, the chemical typically used as a poison at parts per million as high as .00021, they wouldn't notice such, to them, a small amount. The food which you can eat, don't steal it from them. They tend to get annoyed. As for caffeine, many species consume it as a stimulant, but humans can and do consume an absolutely absurd amount of it. 

Sleep: Humans ideally spend 1/6th a cycle resting. It apparently used to be much higher but advancements in cybernetic and genetic augmentation let them reduce their needed sleep. Don't wake a sleeping human unless there's an emergency such as the ship is about to crash or be boarded by pirates. If you do have to wake a human, do so from at least twice the length of their arms away. Ensure caffeine, typically in the form of coffee, is readily available.

Augmentation: Pretty much human has some level of genetic, cybernetic, and nanobot augmentation. An unaugmented human is a bit scary in a direct fight, most humans can punch through meters of graphene reinforced titanium-gold alloys. No, we have no idea how their nervous system is able to handle the augments.

Durability: Between their augments and natural sturdiness, they will often take damage to their dermal layer and not even notice it. Slight bleeding or localized discoloration of the skin after an impact is not a reason to rush them to medical despite their protests. Yes, we realize that either of those things would be, and is, reason to do so for anyone else. These beings in question can lose limbs, somehow not die of shock, get a replacement, and be back up on their feet in hours. Try not to be too disturbed.

Pets: While humans are not the first species to have pets, it is rare. A pet is an animal kept solely for companionship. At one point a Xrlnk't mistook an animal in a human's quarters for food meant to be eaten live. Firstly, refer back to humans getting annoyed when their food is stolen. Secondly, when the human in question found out that their pet had been eaten, the law enforcement for the sector ended up traumatized. So long as you do not harm them, most human pets enjoy being stroke, however many are also unaware of their strength and may unintentionally injure beings. Humans also have a tendency to walk up to massive predators such as the Infernus Cattus, and somehow make them pets. You get used to it eventually.

Attacking a human: Don't. If for some Omnissiah forsaken reason you have to, go get friends and lots of anti-tank guns. That or other humans. Preferably both. In general, however, it's a bad idea.

Boredom: Many species experience boredom. Humans experience it faster. They are known for their tendency to tinker with things when bored. Do not let them get bored, especially not a human engineer. While a bored human engineer sometimes leads to beneficial new discoveries, they are often not worth the damage to planets/star systems/causality/sanity.

Sports: If it's a physical sport, don't take part in it. You will die.

Death: Humans typically come back to life so long as their brain hasn't been destroyed. Instead of preparing whatever funeral rituals your species/society/ship may have, instead provide the human corpse with a power source, metals, biomass, and the more uncommon minerals to speed up their recovery. They may be a bit disoriented and not have memories within about .87 minutes of their death, but other than that will be fine. If the human hasn't revived after thirty minutes seek out a medical professional to see if they actually are dead or if something has gone wrong with their revival system and are only half-dead.

Cybersecurity: According to the human's our cybersecurity is absolutely atrocious. After a human accidentally takes over every system in your ship/station/planet as a reflexive action a few times, you learn to stop trying to prevent it and instead try to minimize how much they can change without conscious input.

Clothes: Humans evolved without exoskeletons or any other form of natural armor, and as such used clothes to protect themselves from the environment early on. Clothing remains an important part of human society. Don't demand of a human that they take off their clothes. You will be paying for the sexual harassment lawsuits, not us.

Lawyers: If you see a human lawyer, run. If a human lawyer sees you, run faster. If a human lawyer is against you in a court case, give up before your sentence gets worse. If you see a human running away from something, it's probably a lawyer that they're running away from. Try to keep up. If caught by a human lawyer, attempt to do as little action as possible. If you don't provide them any stimulus they'll typically entertain themselves by filing petabytes of lawsuits on your behalf regarding particulates in the air instead of something worse. No sudden movements.

Notable personality/physiological differences by associated homeland: Canadians don't feel cold, Russians don't feel fear, Americans are always more heavily armed than the others, and French have a flight reflex instead of a fight/flight reflex.

Anthromorphization: We didn't have a term for this before the humans showed up. Humans will coax computers and name vehicles. Yes, they realize that the rock on their desk is neither alive nor sentient. Questioning their intelligence over the issue will get you nothing but irritation from them. Oddly enough, for no discernible scientific reason, this behavior correlates with increased performance from the device in question. The exception being printers which require 38.77% more maintenance if a human is even within the vicinity of it.

Percussive maintenance: It shouldn't work. It works but it really shouldn't.

Cuteness: If your species has fur and large eyes, a human is practically guaranteed to want to pet you at least once. Tell them to stop and they'll typically comply, if not file a complaint with sapient resources.

Translators: Figuring out the primary human language is going slowly. They often speak in cultural references and oxymorons. If they say something offensive, make sure it translated properly before getting mad. We have this issue every time a new species is found and integrated into the Union, but this one, in particular, is especially troublesome.

Loopholes: Humans will find loopholes. Galactic code of law has had to be updated on technicalities because of them a total of 1,299 times as of this writing, including spectacles such as including matter *and antimatter* in the definition of theft.

Engineering: Yes, they have constructed matryoshka brains and stellar lifters en masse. Yes, they are excellent engineers. Yes, they can massively boost the efficacy of every system on your ship/station/whatever. Consider, however, whether you want to deal with said systems immediately not working and or exploding once a human is no longer maintaining them.

Weaponry: If firing it doesn't kill you, having it fired *at* you definitely will. Most somewhat sane beings stop making bigger guns once they start making small tears in the fabric of reality when they fire. Keyword being most.

Despite all these warnings, having human coworkers and friends is highly beneficial. Good luck.",/r/HFY/comments/kmeq5a/a_quick_memo_pertaining_to_human_employment/,213

“Empress above, is that an exo-suit?”

Jason glanced over to where Raisha was pointing. Sure enough, there stood one of the imposing black pseudo-mech suits. The nine-foot hunchbacked machine stood out amongst the hubbub of the defender’s ‘staging’ area, the nearby Shil’vati giving the exo-suit a wide berth.

He leaned on a nearby crate, he and the rest of the cadre having little better to do than ‘hurry up and wait’ before they were deployed.

“I’m surprised the militia has any,” he said. “From what I’ve read, they’re supposed to be pretty expensive.”

Not so much the suit itself, as the miniature anti-gravity drive on the thing’s back. The thing that allowed it – with the aid of its powerful legs and a number of micro-thrusters – to dart around the battlefield like a grasshopper on steroids. The mechs couldn’t fly, but they could jump well enough to do a decent spiderman impression. At least, in an environment with sufficient verticality, like a jungle or a city. A fact that had caught a number of human commanders off guard during the invasion, if the grousing from veterans online was anything to go off.

He didn’t blame them. The idea was all sorts of insane from an engineering perspective. The suit itself was probably simple enough – for a given value of simple – but Jason had less than no idea as to how the anti-gravity drive functioned. Which was really the only thing that let the insane tactic work at all.

“Probably military surplus,” Raisha reasoned, eyes remaining glued to the machine. “The Turox line used to be pretty standard until Helstrom won the contract.” She paused, looking at the runic emblem on the machine’s chest. “Or it’s a family machine.”

“Family machine?” Jason echoed, hating just how many aspects of Shil’vati society he was ignorant of. Some days he felt like a broken record given the number of times he needed to ask for clarification on something someone had mentioned offhandedly.

Raisha glanced at him. “You know, family machine? Veteran retires and buys their suit off the military at a discount.”

So, it was sort of like a veteran taking their service rifle home with them, he mused.

“A whole mech though?” he asked.

Raisha nodded. “It’s not cheap, sure, even for an exo-pilot, who are usually pretty flush. Pays for itself in the end though. If a kid signs up with their own mech, the military provides them with a pretty handy subsidy.”

That sounded like more Shil’vati classism to Jason, old school knights and shit. A logistical nightmare for replacement parts as well. That wasn’t his focus at the minute though.

“People just being able to buy a whole mech though? Isn’t that… you know? Kind of dangerous.”

Raisha seemed honestly befuddled. “Humans aren’t allowed to own weapons?”

“Sure, rifles and shit.”

They’d apparently been allowed to own machineguns and heavier stuff once upon a time, but the Shil’vati had put a blanket ban on automatic weaponry. To admittedly limited success, given said weapons' sheer prevalence before the occupation. Even Jason, with his limited social circle, knew at least one person with a piece of ‘illicit’ hardware in his collection.

“Not the equivalent of goddamn tanks though,” he finished.

Raisha did the head cocking thing. “How strange. What would you do if you… were…”

She trailed off as she realized that she was treading on what was probably a sensitive topic.

“Invaded?” Jason finished, drawing an embarrassed nod from the alien. “Lose apparently.”

He tried to keep the bitterness from his voice, but he was pretty sure he failed miserably. Not that military hardware had helped the actual military any when the Purps had shown up. Tanks weren’t much defense against a foe in orbit.

He’d heard a lot of people say in those early days that the occupation would never work. That it would be like the US in Vietnam. Or the Soviets in Afghanistan. People just had to keep hitting the invaders. Make continued occupation impractical. Eventually the Imperium would realize that Earth was more trouble than it was worth.

Jason felt like laughing at the absurdity of it.

“Every man, woman and child on Earth could have been packing heat and I doubt it would have helped much.” He glanced down at the matte black suit he was wearing. On a fundamental level, it was hard to mount any kind of resistance when the average enemy trooper is wearing armor that most small arms fire literally bounced off of.

When you got right down to the brick and mortar of combat, that was the main problem. The US military might have had a technological edge over the Vietnamese, but an American soldier was just as vulnerable to a bullet to the spleen as the next guy.

The Shil’vati didn’t have that weakness.

The smallest Earth-based armament that could reasonably and reliably down an armored Shil’vati probably had more in common with an anti-materiel rifle than a true small arm. Whatever form that took would inevitably be big, cumbersome, slow, and require a certain amount of advanced infrastructure to build, repair and rearm. Not the kind of thing that an underground resistance cell would be able to acquire or deploy without significant difficulty.

No, if Earth was ever going to be free of the Imperium, it was going to need outside help.

“Doesn’t matter now though,” he said, as much to himself as to Raisha. “It’s all in the past, and has no bearing on me, you or our current circumstances. We’re here to win this thing and show those Interior pukes who’s who.”

Raisha nodded happily, evidently relieved to be free of a potentially awkward conversation.

“Well, I’m glad to see you’re excited,” Nuiy chimed in from behind as she walked up to them.

The sight of the woman had the rest of the cadre perking up from their own positions sprawled around the group’s small designated assembly area.

“What’s the news, ‘leader’?” Freyxh said, a slight teasing lilt to her voice as she used the older woman's new temporary rank.

It had come as no surprise to any of them that the Instructors had designated Nuiy as the cadre’s leader for the exercise. They wanted the recruits to win as well, after all, and the woman had the most command experience in the cadre by a mile. Something Jason was more than glad for, lest his own name be raised as an option.

Just being the leader of a pod including Raisha and Tarcil had been pressure enough for him. Especially given that his fellow male was still pointedly avoiding him. Something he just had to tacitly accept until the guy chose to talk to him, even if his every instinct *demanded* that he force the issue.

Though Jason’s antipathy towards leadership hadn’t stopped Freyxh from jokingly commenting that as a human, he should have been the leader anyway. Because he was from Earth, he clearly had a wealth of knowledge on how to command a resistance cell, make traps and fashion improvised weapons.

He’d laughed at the not-quite joke, but in retrospect, the whole idea had come off as not a little racist to him. Earth had an active resistance, yes, but that didn’t automatically make every human a freedom fighter who could fashion a pipe bomb from toilet rolls, firecrackers and raw patriotic furor.

If he *did* know how to make a Molotov cocktail or fashion a punji-pit trap – which he did - it was because of his background in engineering, rather than any rebellious history.

“What’s the score, leader?” Vieyshi asked.

“We’ll be going in with the second wave,” Nuiy said without preamble, bringing out her data-pad, prompting everyone else to do the same. Jason had just a moment to see an acknowledgement from the device of Nuiy’s superior credentials, before the image flipped to a map of the abandoned town the exercise would take place in.

“The seventh militia are local to this area so they, along with a few others, are going to be setting up defenses before the Interior attack. They’ve got five hours to do so before the Interior deploy. Two hours after that is when we deploy, to simulate units being sourced from nearby.”

“How are we deploying?” Raisha asked, glancing over at a nearby shuttle.

Nuiy nodded. “As you’ve guessed, we’re going to be deploying via shuttle. Two pods each.” She tapped her pad a few times, and in response Jason watched a few blue spots appear on his own map. “These are the positions the militia commander thinks are likely to be hottest, so they are where you’re most likely to be deployed. It would serve you well to study those locations in detail before then.”

Jason watched his fellow pod leaders nod seriously. He needn’t bother asking why they weren’t being deployed together as a unit. Concentrated force was anathema to Shil’vati combat doctrine - even in a scenario without orbital fire. Instead they were liable to be nickeled and dimed as needed, subject to whichever commander was on the ground at whichever site they arrived at.

Nuiy continued the briefing, listing out possible attack routes, retreat paths, the makeup of their own forces, and the enemy. Which essentially boiled down to everywhere, nowhere, poorly equipped and well-equipped, respectively.

“With all that said, good luck, girls – and guys.” Nuiy finished, before running her gaze over all of them slowly. “Just remember; follow your orders, keep calm, and do as we’ve been trained. Do all that, and we’ll all get out of this with the recommendations for the careers we want.”

“And a victory we can rub in those snooty Interior cunt’s noses!” Vieyshi, or perhaps Vieysha, chimed in.

Nuiy frowned for just a moment, before a smile broke out over her face. “That too.”

The whole group cheered rowdily in agreement and anticipation, with Jason being no exception.

\--------------------

&amp;#x200B;

“Is it supposed to be making that noise?” Even as Jason craned in his crash seat to ask the question, he already knew the answer. 

No. The answer was no. You didn’t need to be familiar with Shil’vati tech to know that an engine making a rattling sound was bad. That was pretty universal, alien super science or not.

Rather than Raisha answering, Jason was surprised to hear Tarcil’s subdued tones coming over the comms.

“Probably not. If the local militia are anything like the ones back home, they’ve probably been slacking on maintenance.”

Suddenly the slightly worrying sound of the engine overhead was of less importance, as he tried to keep the conversation going.

“You know, I’ve been meaning to ask, what exactly does the militia do?”

He could almost physically see Raisha’s eyes lighting up as her helmet turned as best it could in the tight restraints of her seat, no doubt desperate to expound on the topic. Fortunately, they were close enough that even with his own limited range of movement, he was able to stomp the girl's foot before she could cut Tarcil off with a deluge of militia facts.

The girl probably barely felt the blow, given that she was armored, but given that she didn’t speak, she apparently got the message. Or she was pausing to puzzle over why someone was energetically stomping on her foot. He also had to wonder what the pod sitting across from them were thinking?

It didn't matter either way, as Tarcil wasn’t interrupted and he started to explain.

“Ostensibly they’re there as a last line of defense in case of an attack,” Tarcil said tonelessly. “In reality, more often not, they act as law enforcement.”

“I thought that was the Interior’s job?” Jason prompted, fairly interested in the discussion despite the fact that his main goal was to keep Tarcil talking.

The other male made a so-so gesture. “It’s complicated. The Interior might be in charge of it all, but you aren’t going to see them out patrolling the streets or anything like that. Small shit’s beneath them. They leave that to the militia. The Interior will only really come in if it’s worth their time. Murders, kidnappers, data-crime, foreign agents and the like, rather than… shoplifters, brawls or drunks. A member of the Interior will also probably call in the militia to secure the scene when they’re conducting an investigation.”

So the militia acted like the local sheriff’s department while the Interior was more like the FBI… or a number of other three letter organizations. Point was that the militia were basically cops. Cops with a militaristic bent. 

...Cops who used surplus military equipment and occasionally filled in as the national guard.

“I get the feeling you’re not so much interested in Shil’vati law enforcement as hashing out this awkwardness between us?” Tarcil said, interrupting Jason’s train of thought.

“That obvious?” he asked.

“Reasonably,” Tarcil said, trying to shrug despite the restraints holding him in place. “This is probably our last chance to do so.”

Jason glanced up at his HUD. They still had twenty minutes before they were supposed to reach the abandoned hospital, where a proper furball had supposedly developed between the militia and a few pods of Interior agents.

“I imagine Jason would have preferred to talk in the *five hours* we were all stuck waiting on the tarmac,” Raisha put in, an uncharacteristic hint of peevishness in her tone. “Unfortunately, you were still sulking in the corner.”

Tarcil’s helmet kept his expression hidden, but there was no missing the scowl in his voice as he leaned forward to look at Raisha. “I was *thinking.* A notion that I’m sure must be strange to you.”

Raisha looked like she was going to speak again, but Jason cut them both off before it could devolve into name calling and mudslinging.

“Alright, that’s enough of that. Christ, it’s like being back in high school.” He turned to Raisha, softening his tone. “Thank you for sticking up for me, Raisha. It means a lot.” He paused a moment to allow that to sink in, before he continued with a hint of reproach. “You didn’t need to though. I can speak for myself just fine. I realize it’s unfair, but would you be willing to let me and Tarcil speak privately?”

Or at least, as privately as they could get in the tight confines of a shuttle occupied by six marine recruits and one pilot. Fortunately, they could keep their communications to just pod-comms to cut the others out, but there was no way of cutting Raisha out of them. Not without her choosing to do so. Something the woman realized, because she gave a put-upon sigh, before a click heralded her switching comm channel.

Sending a mental thanks to his… girlfriend? Vaguely defined love interest? Inappropriate romantic entanglement?

…Teammate.

After sending a mental thanks to his *teammate*, his head swiveled back to Tarcil.

“I shouldn’t have insulted her like that,” Tarcil said, cutting him off. “This isn’t a good time for friction.”

“No, it’s not,” Jason admitted. “She shouldn’t have insulted you either though. Besides, as you said, this is probably going to be our last chance to talk for a while. Might as well get it out there.”

Tarcil scoffed, a hint of dry humor in his tone. “Such a girl. Or guy, I suppose. It could wait.”

Jason shrugged, or at least attempted to, before encountering the same issue Tarcil did not a minute earlier.

“If we’re about to get into a firefight, I’d really like to clear the air between us first.” He stared at his fellow male’s mask clad face. “I imagine you feel the same, given that you chose to bring it up now.”

Tarcil's head cocked to the side, a dash of humor in his tone. “You sure you’re Jason? That almost sounded like a hint of emotional understanding. Nothing like the human I know.”

Jason chuckled. “What can I say? You run through a possible conversation in your head enough times, you realize a few things you might not have otherwise.”

“I get that,” Tarcil murmured. “Good to know I wasn’t the only one doing that.”

Jason smiled, before his tone turned serious. They didn’t have a lot of time, and neither of them could afford to dance around the topic anymore.

“I shouldn’t have spoken to you that way. That night.”

“Straight to the heart of it, huh?” Tarcil said, before sighing. “No. No, you shouldn’t have.”

He turned his head, to look at the, honestly pretty dirty, ceiling of the shuttle. “Fortunately for you, I’m willing to forgive you.” He paused.” It’d hardly be the first time I’ve had someone explode on me after a rejection.”

The alien chuckled. “Though I’ll admit that this is the first time that the one exploding on me was the rejector.

Jason felt his eyebrows shoot up.

After all the delays. The avoidance. He was being forgiven? “Just like that?”

Tarcil laughed at his friend’s confusion. “Just like that.”

“Why?”

The Shil’vati clicked his tongue. “Honestly Jason, you can be such a woman - or a guy, I suppose.” The alien paused. “I thought about that a lot these past few days. Reminded myself that for all we share the same gender, we don’t think alike.”

Jason had no idea where this was going, so he kept silent.

Something that only seemed to irritate his friend. “See? Just like that? Going all silent. Such a female – gah, guy! - thing to do.”

“I just don’t know what you’re leading towards?”

“Stress!” Tarcil hissed. “You are stressed and you don’t even know it!” The alien stared directly into his mask. “First you were taken from everything you’ve even known and shoved into bootcamp. Alien bootcamp. Then you were surrounded by horny women who kept prodding you at all hours. Something you clearly had no experience with and no idea what to do about. And finally you had whatever the fuck happened two weeks ago happen to you.”

The alien stared at him. “You were jumpy for days afterwards, but you didn’t say shit to me, or anyone, about it!”

Jason was speechless, but he eventually managed to say argue back. “I just… didn’t want to talk about it. It was nothing.”

He meant it too, but that was clearly the wrong answer as Tarcil slammed his head into the back of his headrest with a put-upon hiss. “See? You clam right up, just like you did whenever I tried to bring it up.”

The alien sighed, and waved a hand dismissively. “Whatever. Your secrets are your own. I won’t try to force them out of you, even if I think it would be good for you to talk to someone. My point is that something like this was inevitable. Better you exploded at me rather than an instructor.

“That doesn’t make it right,” Jason finally managed to mumble.

“No,” Tarcil said, a hint of soothing in his tone, “but it makes it understandable.”

Jason found a smile making its way onto his face. “You know, you’re too good a friend for a guy like me.”

“I am pretty great, aren’t I?” Tarcil laughed. “Thought not without my own glaring flaws.”

Jason couldn’t see his fellow male’s face, but he knew they were both smiling at each other under their masks.

Unfortunately, the moment couldn’t last. As he glanced at the timer on his HUD, he knew he still needed to broach the other topic. The insinuation that had really caused this whole thing to expand from a few harsh words into a real dagger to the heart of their friendship.

“About what I said… about-”

“Don’t!” Tarcil cut in, any hint of his previous levity gone. “Just… don’t.”

“But I-”

“I don’t want to talk about it.” The alien sounded tired. “You wanted forgiveness. You’re forgiven. Just leave it.”

Jason stared at his friend as the alien’s mask turned away. He opened his mouth to speak, before closing it.

It didn’t feel right to him, just leaving the topic fallow, but he was willing to accede to his friends wishes. He could bring it up again when-

“We’ve got a lock,” the pilots strident tones blared from the shuttle’s intercom. “Apparently the Purps brought AA. Everyone brace for evasive maneuvers. I’mma see if I can shake ‘em.”

Then Jason didn’t have much time to think of anything as his smooth shuttle ride turned into the rollercoaster from hell.

Neu Vieumau Joint Occupation Zone

Raiden was pretty happy with how the day was going so far. Get some credits, maybe actually get some new shoes… He wasn’t sure exactly if he should get his hopes up though. Why would the barter shop guy give him something so good for free? Would the human military police not live up to the coupon? His various experiences with the local militia had not exactly warmed him up to the idea that they had his best interests at heart. Yet… when he had called for help in the alleyway that squad of them had come running without hesitation.

Shifting the straps of the small pack a little he felt a growing unease gnawing at his insides as he walked along the streets towards the old police station. There were so many unknowns that could flare up that gave rise to a vast imagination of everything going wrong. He was just one corner away from the street it was on. Since the humans had moved in they’d set up barricades and more security than the old militia had, and just the thought of turning onto the street was making him hesitate. He wanted to consider his options here…

“Raiden!” He turned and saw Lenk and Neff exiting an alley across the street. Lenk was holding a bent pipe in one hand menacingly. Raiden immediately considered his options and turned the corner onto the street with the police station. Whatever else might happen they weren’t Neff and Lenk who were obviously still pissed he’d ruined their chance to scavenge that fancy bot. “Raiden!” He heard him call from around the corner and picked up his speed a little, gripping the straps of his pack as he tried to walk fast enough to make sure he’d get to the barricades, without making it look like he was running away from people exactly.

A little up the street were the sandbags and razorwire being manned by the blue armor human soldiers. Most of them seemed to just be sitting around, two had their helmets off and were smoking. But in the middle of the post and towering above everything else was a three meter tall mech suit. Someone had gone through the trouble of painting a black band on its arm with MP in white letters on the outside. As if that really meant anything. The effect was also somewhat spoiled by the mech having “To Pillage and Stomp” written on the side of its head.

Once Raiden had gotten closer to the barricades he looked back and saw Lenk and Neff round the corner, but stopped short when they realized where they were. “[Can’t hide forever!]” Lenk angrily yelled at him and then they both quickly retreated.

This had gotten the attention of some of the soldiers at the post who looked Raiden’s way when he approached. “What did you do to piss those guys off, kid?” One asked as he neared the opening in the barricades off to the side of the street.

“Yeah I uh… guess they’re mad I fucked their sister.” He responded with the first thing that came to mind. The soldiers around him all laughed at that.

“Hey sorry kid we can’t offer police protection to sister fuckers if that’s why you’re here.” One mentioned with a chuckle.

“No, but we can offer you a smoke.” One of the soldiers who had been smoking pulled a crumpled pack from his armored vest to hold it out.

“Dude, don’t go giving a kid a smoke. Fuck is wrong with you?” Mentioned the other smoking soldier right next to him.

“I’m not saying he has to! Just offering. The kid made me laugh.” Replied the first smoker.

“Uhm…” Raiden eyed the pack being held out. “If I took one it would be just to barter with. Is that okay?”

“I’m offering you a smoke. Don’t have to smoke it here.” The smoker replied with a grin. Raiden nodded and took a cigarette to carefully tuck behind his ear.

“Thanks.” He nodded to the smoker and headed up the stairs into the police station itself. First he noticed the doors had been substantially reinforced, then the moment he stepped inside he was met with a security scanner. A pair of soldiers were manning it, chatting in the middle, but seeing him they split up, one heading to the cargo scanner while the other stood by the frame in the middle.

“Pack on the conveyor. Any sharp objects or hazardous stuff we need to know about?” The first soldier sounding bored out of his mind asked as Raiden approached and unslung his pack to set on the conveyor.

“I don’t think so? I’m making deliveries. It’s… food and stuff. Please don’t open the packages. I would like to get paid. Also be careful cause one of them has a laxative in it.” When he said that the soldier arched a brow but nodded and began to push the bag into the scanner. Raiden headed into the central frame then, already lifting his arms above his head before needing to be told. He was familiar with the operation.

There was a light hum as the scanner… scanned he supposed. Then he heard a light beep. “Hey kid…” This would be it. Something was wrong, or there was a tax they hadn’t mentioned. “You’re too young to smoke.” The soldier manning the scanner frame reached out to take the cigarette from behind his ear.

“Oh, uhm the guy outside gave it to me for making him laugh.” Raiden explained. “I’m not going to smoke it. Just use it to barter for like a candy bar.”

“Huh… alright. Well just remember kid, smoking is bad.” The soldier handed Raiden the cigarette back and waved him through. Grabbing his pack he headed further inside and yet still felt a bit apprehensive. Was this really going to be this easy? Ahead was a desk with the first soldiers he’d seen not in armor. There were two, and they were wearing what looked like basic olive drab uniforms. One up front was wearing a hat he’d never seen before either. Then again he only ever saw them in helmets or without. It struck him as a little odd the man would wear a hat indoors but who was he to judge? He did notice stripes on his arm, that meant he was in charge right?

Just as Raiden was trying to figure out how to address the soldier he looked up and saw Raiden looking at him. “What can I do for you kid?”

Did everyone have to call him Kid? “I uh… I am here with a coupon. For boots.” He opened his pack to fish around for the paper the barter store owner had given him.

“A coupon for boots? Kid this isn’t a shoe store.” Raiden focused on moving the boxes around trying desperately to find the paper. How was it in a small pack with so few things in it he suddenly couldn’t find the only piece of paper? “Is that a cigarette behind your ear? Kid you shouldn’t smoke, it’s bad for you.”

“Why does everyone keep telling me that?” Raiden blurted out, feeling flustered. “I’m not going to smoke it! I’m just going to barter it! And I don’t have anywhere else to keep it safe. Besides don’t you guys get cigarettes in your rations?” Raiden countered.

“Yeah but if we die before retirement age they don’t have to pay us any pensions.” The soldier replied with a shrug.

“What?” Raiden asked, feeling more confused now.

“Never mind kid it’ll make more sense when you’re older. If you don’t smoke that is. Otherwise you’ll die young and runty. It’s bad for you.” Raiden rolled his eyes a moment but finally fished out the piece of paper to hand over. “Kid I’m telling you this isn’t a shoe store it’s a police station.”

“Guidelines state we’re not supposed to call it a police station. It’s an MP CP.” The other soldier without a hat working behind the desk mentioned.

“Excuse me?” The striped soldier glanced over.

“Official guidelines state we’re supposed to refer to it as a police station since we’re still a military unit. Therefore we’re supposed to refer to it as a military police command post. Command point? Control post? Control point?” The soldier sounded less sure with every iteration. “MP CP.” He returned to the first set of letters.

“Since when the fuck do you read guidelines?” The front soldier asked.

“Since you told me to sarge.” The other replied sounding a bit defensive.

“Yes, because you kept fucking up your paperwork and now you’re lecturing me on calling this place an MP CP?” He shook his head and sighed before finally returning his focus on Raiden. He did take the paper though and as he looked it over a moment he frowned, then he turned to type on his computer. Raiden stood there, unsure of what to do until the sarge finally spoke up. “Huh… Well… it’s actually real. Whadya know. Alright kid I guess you’re off to requisition. Down that hall, down the stairs on your right, and then take a right at the bottom and go straight. It’ll be posted. The other way is the morgue. Don’t go that way.” The sarge handed him back the coupon.

“Thanks.” Raiden nodded, and headed off to follow the directions. The hallway he headed down smelled vaguely of paint, and when he looked it seemed like they must have painted it recently. They’d gone with a sort of… deep purple. Like on their void flag. Probably to distance themselves from the militia they’d replaced. The militia always used gold, or what they claimed was gold color. He always thought it looked more like dry mustard.

Finding the stairs was easy, and once he reached the bottom he saw the sign on the far wall easily. Requisition to his right, morgue to his left. The fresh paint smell was even more heavy down here. Heading towards requisition he carefully opened a door and saw another desk ahead much like the one upstairs. Except behind it was glass overlooking some kind of big… warehouse filled with shelves. The arrangement of the stuff inside reminded him of Clay and his barter shop.

Down here there were two soldiers, a man and woman in the same olive drab uniforms as upstairs, though neither wore a hat and neither was working. Instead they were facing the window and talking. Just as he got closer he could start to overhear the woman first. “So then what did you do?”

“The fuck do you think I did? I pulled up my pants and got the fuck out of there before she noticed what happened.” The man replied which caused the woman to laugh.

“You dirty fuck.” She shook her head slowly.

“What the fuck else could I do?” The man shrugged.

“You say excuse me ma’am in the interest of human Davari relations I feel I should inform you that I’ve made a bit of a mess of your sheets and need some help.” The woman was laughing even as she suggested this.

“Fuck you.” Came his reply.

“So what happened when you went back to the bar?” The woman asked next.

“You think I went back? Fuck no. I’ve been avoiding it ever since! And it sucks cause those drinks were good too. Strong. And cheap. And strong…” The man shook his head slowly and let out a heavy sigh.

“Yeah strong enough to make you-” The woman just began to turn in her chair and saw Raiden standing at the counter. “HOLY SHIT!” She jumped a bit which made the other soldier jump and Raiden flinched, worried he was about to get shot. But neither pulled out a gun or anything and the woman just set a hand over her chest. “Fuck kid! Where the hell did you come from?!”

“How much did you hear?!” Asked the man, seeming more worried about that.

“I uh… something about you pulling up your pants. I don’t know.” Raiden looked between them. “I have a coupon for boots.”

“What? This isn’t a shoe store.” The woman replied but when he handed over the paper she typed the details into her computer and just upstairs something positive happened. “Huh… okay. Well… but it says footwear. Not boots. We just have to give you footwear.” Raiden sighed a little, boots had been a bit much of an ask anyway.

“Do we have anything else for footwear?” The male soldier asked with a confused look.

“Well… no. But… he’s a civvie. Can we give him mil-spec?” The woman asked.

“They’re fucking boots.” The man countered.

“Yeah, mil-spec boots. You remember that fucking lecture on no mil-spec items distributing across the civvies.” The woman shrugged and scratched her head. “Check… check the regs.”

“Why me?” The man asked.

“Because I’m the corporal and I fucking told you to.” She sternly growled back. The man sighed and pulled a worn looking book out of a desk drawer as he started to flip through it.

“What’s going on here?” It was Raiden’s turn to jump as he was surprised to hear a voice behind him. Turning he saw a soldier entering the room wearing armor.

“Staff Sergeant.” The woman stood up. “This civilian brought in a… uh coupon for boots. But the form only specifies footwear. Yet, we only have boots.”

“And… this is a problem… why?” The armored soldier asked as he approached Raiden and looked him over.

“They’re mil-spec. And we just had the meeting about not distributing mil-spec good to-” She was about to continue but the staff sergeant just waved it off.

“This kid helped us out earlier. Told us who that van belongs to that we’ve been trying to figure out for a week.” Raiden realized this must be the sarge from the squad in front of the pawn shop. In the armor and helmets he didn’t recognize them.

“The one by the pawn shop?” The woman asked, confirming his realization.

“Yep. Turns out it belongs to the guy who lives at the home it's parked in front of.” The armored soldier shook his head slowly.

“How did it take us a week to figure that out?” The woman asked.

“Because no one there would talk to us. Kid, why would no one talk to us?” The armored soldier asked him directly then.

“Uhm… because they don’t really trust the occupiers. The militia before they pulled out said a lot of… stuff.” Raiden didn’t feel like getting specific.

“Save these miserable bastards only for them to hate our guts.” The woman muttered with a sigh.

“Still, he helped us out. So, get him some boots.” The armored soldier commanded then.

“Yes, sir.” The woman nodded before looking at Raiden. “What’s your shoe size kid?”

“Uh…” Raiden paused.

“Right… in which units. We’ve got five around here don’t we? Just… give me a shoe.” She held out a hand and Raiden looked down at his feet. He felt a flush of embarrassment rise to his cheeks but he carefully leaned against the desk and raised his ankle over his other knee in a squat so he could delicately pull the rubber and fabric he’d fashioned into footwear off his foot. When he set it on the desk then a look crossed her face. Pity. He looked away, feeling even more humiliated with the position he was in. “Boots… and. Staff Sergeant mind if I get him some socks too?”

“That’s a good idea.” Soon as he approved it the woman headed into the back. Raiden felt a heat grow within him as they talked about it. They all pitied him. They felt bad. He didn’t have proper shoes or socks. He was some… street rat. Some kid to them. Somehow this felt worse to him than if they’d been berating him and insulting him like the militia used to. His hands clenched at the straps of his backpack. “I bet your feet are tougher than mine kid. You’re a real badass, you know that?”

Raiden looked up at the armored soldier in confusion when he said that. “What? I’m not.”

“Yeah, you are.” The armored soldier nodded slowly. “Growing up around here can’t be easy. Between the war and everything else but you’re sticking it out. You didn’t have that pack when you entered the pawn shop. Do you work there?”

“It’s… I’m trying out for it.” Raiden nodded slowly. “Gave me some deliveries to make and the coupon for the boots.” He felt quiet as he spoke. His emotions somewhat jumbled up between the confusion and embarrassment.

“That’s nice of him. What’s your name anyway?” The soldier set a hand on his shoulder then applied just a little bit of pressure as if to help reassure him.

“Raiden.” He answered with a light gulp.

“Well Raiden, I’m sure you’re tougher than half my platoon. They bitch if they don’t get fruit punch in their rations and here you are hoofing it around town with shoes you made yourself. It’s admirable. Isn’t it specialist?” He looked over at the other soldier behind the desk.

“Uh yes. Yes, staff sergeant it is admirable. Very-very admirable.” He nodded. Raiden felt a slightly different flush of embarrassment now. He didn’t know how to process compliments.

“Thanks.” He nearly whispered as he looked at the floor. His one foot clad only in a thread bare dirty sock, his big toe sticking out of a hole in the front.

“Raiden, since you’re here and you helped me out earlier, mind if I ask you something else? You seem pretty streetsmart. Maybe you’ll know.” Raiden looked up at the sarge wondering what the question was. “Little over a week ago a building exploded. Or… the top did. Hear anything about it? Any… word on the street?”

“That tower over in the Ravex occupation zone?” He asked and the sarge nodded. “I mean… nothing really. I had heard it belonged to some… eccentric Kra’Kto’Sui. Lived in the pool up top. Uhm… just… rumours about crime… maybe drugs. People said he paid for info on stuff.” Raiden shrugged.

“Remember kid, uh Raiden, just say no to drugs.” The soldier behind the desk added. Raiden looked at him with a confused frown. “If you’re offered drugs… just say no. Isn’t that right sarge?”

“Yes… Yes specialist that is correct. Say no to drugs. Like all the amphetamines you do. Or the booze.” The specialist blinked at that.

“Wait. How did this become about me? I only do mil-spec amphetamines sarge! Honest! And I only drink off duty! I follow all the stup-uuhhhh official guidelines! I don’t rape people or drive drunk or get into fights or anything! And… I am… well noted for… my… uuhhhhh… consistent drive to improve our relations with local Davari. I was… just speaking to Corporal Colbert about my efforts in fact staff sergeant.” The armored soldier released Raiden’s shoulder just so he could grip the front of his helmet visor and shake his head. “What?”

“Here, see if these fit.” Raiden had been so focused on the sarge and the specialist that he didn’t notice the woman had returned until she was setting out some socks on the desk before him, and a pair of black boots that looked brand new. Raiden nervously reached out to take the socks and boots, almost expecting the soldiers to yank them away in a moment. Yet, they just watched him. Looking around he saw a chair in the corner and walked over to it, so he could sit down and try the boots and socks on.

“Staff sergeant, by the way I didn’t mean to hassle the kid about the boots. It’s just the CO had that memo about mil-spec items-” The woman began to explain but the sage just raised a hand.

“CYA. I understand corporal.” Raiden glanced up as he removed his other shoe and socks. Just pulling the full thick military socks over his feet made him shiver a little. They were so soft… Then he looked at the boots. They were… tall. Very tall. He also didn’t see any laces and was a bit confused.

“Are those jump boots? Why does he get jump boots? We don’t get jump boots.” The specialist complained while Raiden looked the boots over. When he looked up both the woman and the sarge were staring at him. “Uh… I mean… those are very nice boots ki-Raiden. Hope you enjoy them.”

“How do I put them on?” Raiden confessed then. “I don’t see laces.”

“Just pull them on first.” The sarge instructed, so Raiden pulled one onto his right foot first. It felt… cushoiny. Unlike why he expected. “Now feel along the top for a little nub on either side and pinch them at the same time.” Raiden’s fingers carefully squeezed along the top lining of the boot to find the nubs set inside the fabric. Then he pinched them and suddenly the boot seemed to shrink around his foot feeling perfectly snug.

“Whoa…” He muttered as the soldiers chuckled a bit.

“Nice isn’t it? Sometimes they don’t skimp on gear. Sometimes. How does it feel?” Raiden looked down at his foot and hesitantly put weight onto his heel. It was hard to describe exactly. His foot felt wrapped up in a soft cushion and yet… supported at the same time. It was unlike anything he’d experienced.

“Good? I think? I’ve never… had new shoes or… anything like this.” He confessed.

“Put the other on, stand up, and take a few steps. Wiggle your toes. You want enough space so your toes aren’t crushed but not so much your foot slides around.” The sarge informed him. Raiden quickly pulled the other boot on and repeated the process to make the boot snug up. When he rose to his feet he nearly jumped up, it felt like there was such little weight on his feet, yet so much more… Just… better.

After hesitating a moment he took a few steps and then slowly rose up onto the tips of his toes and back down as if trying to get a feel for being a couple centimeters taller thanks to the thick soles. “It feels amazing.”

“Glad to hear it. Did you get more socks corporal Colbert?” The sarge asked.

“Right yeah. I don’t care what you think you should be doing. Put on a new set every day. And please wash them regularly.” The woman handed him four more sets of socks.

“Thanks… I… I don’t know what to say.” Raiden shrugged a little, feeling put on the spot.

“Don’t worry about it Raiden. Just remember, if you hear anything or see anything we need to know come tell us. Crime, planned attacks, terrorists, anything like that at all. You come find me. Or, any of the human patrols here honestly. Doesn’t have to be void.” The sarge mentioned.

“Aren’t you all void?” Raiden asked with a frown. “Didn’t you guys get approval to move into the joint occupation zone? Isn’t that why you’re here?”

“We’re the ones who moved into the MP CPs, uh the police stations here yes. But this zone is patrolled by all members of the joint occupation forces. We’re in blue armor, the American marines are in desert camo and high vis vests, and the slavs are usually in urban camo and have SSR patches. Hard to miss.” Raiden squinted a moment.

“You’re all different? Also… desert camo?” Some of the planet was arid, and there were a few deserts sure. But Neu Vieumau was coastal and not even close to desert.

“Don’t ask me, it’s what they’re wearing. And yes, we’re all different. Plus there’s Ravex, and Kra’Kto’Sui, and of course the Rimjobs. Uuhhhh Rimmers. Shit. Reformed Imperial Military. Don’t call them Rimmers. They don’t like that.” Raiden knew that the joint occupation situation was complicated but he hadn’t realized just how complicated until now. Then again for the last several years his primary concern had been surviving his dad and passing the public education tests.

“Okay. I’ll let you know.” He nodded. “But thanks again.”

“Good luck getting your job.” The sarge added as Raiden nodded and headed out the door. He couldn’t help but move a bit faster down the hall and then once he got to the stairs he rushed up them as if his feet didn’t weigh a thing. He felt a little silly but he knew he had a big grin on his face. Real footwear! It was like a dream.

“Guess we do give out boots.” Raiden looked over at the guy at the front desk and nodded.

“Yes. They were very nice down there.” He added.

“In requisition? If you say so.” The soldier made a face as if it was impossible to believe. Even so Raiden headed out of the police station… MP CP and back into the cluster of soldiers posted out front.

“Hey kid, nice drop boots.” One commented as he walked out. “Off to fuck someone else’s sister in those?”

“Yeah yours.” He was as surprised as the soldier no doubt by his immediate reply but around him the other soldiers all began to laugh. It was a bit of an instinct from dealing with comments by the militia before but now he felt bad.

“Kid… my sister would eat you alive and not in a way you’d enjoy but you’re fucking welcome to it.” The soldier shook his head a moment as the others kept laughing. Raiden just gave a nervous grin and kept walking before anything worse happened.

With that done he pulled out the paper that listed all the packages and their addresses. There was one just a few streets up. That old house that had been abandoned he thought. Maybe someone had moved in? Either way he began heading that direction and caught himself bouncing on the heels of his feet a little with his steps. His feet felt so good! The boots were amazing! Nothing could ruin his day now!

“[A reckoning has come across the bilge rat!]” Raiden just barely had time to process Neff stepping out of the basement steps to his side, swinging a board at Raiden. Moving purely on reflex, Raiden jumped to the side, feeling the edge of the board tug at the sleeve of his shirt a moment. Lenk was across the street having been waiting in case Raiden had turned the other way. 

The soldiers were just around the corner, but Neff was between him and them, not to mention Lenk would be rushing over. So Raiden turned and began sprinting up the street. Neff’s full force swing with the board had shifted his momentum so Raiden had a second of lead to use. If he’d been in his old rags… He’d left them with the soldiers! He’d completely forgotten to pick them up! They were probably thinking he was a rude- “[Wrath knows no distance! Run and die tired coward!]”

Right focus on running. Neff and Lenk were both older than him and taller. Raiden could outrun them with a swift burst of speed but every time he focused on just running straight they’d catch up to him eventually. He could already hear their footsteps racing behind him though he didn’t dare spare a glance. Instead he broke hard left down the alley behind the Tviraki restaurant. There were always plenty of leftover crates down there.

Sprinting past some empty boxes he grabbed the edges and yanked to tumble them in Neff’s path while he looked at the big fence up ahead. Normally he’d never make it but in these boots… He could jump up the trash can onto the dumpster and then roll over the top of the fence and drop down onto the dumpster on the other side. He could do it. He had to do it. “[Nowhere to go you cancerous runt!]” He really had to do it.

Raiden jumped up onto the trash can, and felt it start to tilt with his weight as he stepped off it to charge across the thankfully closed dumpster before leaping as high as he could muster. Rather than roll over the top of the fence however he was shocked to find he cleared the top of the fence easily. Though his added height meant he was coming down on the far edge of the dumpster, not the middle… And it was open, not closed. 

His eyes went wide with horror as he seemed to be coming straight down into a pile of rotten food scraps and whatever else the restaurant had thrown out. The stench wafted up into his nostrils even as he descended. Desperately he waved his arms, spinning them in the air as if to fly, or just get that tiny bit of extra momentum. Thankfully this seemed to work as his feed landed on the edge of the dumpster. He wanted to shout in victory, yet the shock of his landing transferred up to his knees which buckled a bit and had to quickly lean forward, sloppily rolling forward as he tumbled down into a cluster of trash cans.

Having his fall broken by metal trash cans was hardly ideal as he rolled off them to the ground, his shoulder and ankle immediately groaning in pain. Yet, he had made it over and he looked back at Neff on the other side of the fence obviously surprised. “Hah! [Scum sucking parasite!]” Raiden did his best to hide his pain as he raised his middle finger at the bully chasing after him.

Yet Neff was not easily deterred. He jumped up onto the dumpster and got ready to hop over the top of the fence after Raiden. “Oh shit…” He turned and quickly ran off down the alley before Neff could drop down. His ankle groaned a bit harder but he pushed through and kept running. The house was just up ahead. What good was that going to do him?! They were just going to beat his ass on the doorstep! But he had no other way to try and get away. So he just kept running.

On the far side of the alleyway he looked to his right and sprinted as best he could to the structure. It had a brick wall around it to isolate it from the neighbors. The three story structure looked ominous, with blacked out windows and a bone white paint along the old wooden structure. Wrought iron spikes lining the wall, and the gate leading in was bent into the shape of the Paragon of Wrath Bioujar Dooritay. One didn’t usually want to mess with the disciples of Dooritay.

But Raiden didn’t have a choice as he frantically opened the gate and rushed inside then up the steps to the door. His finger hammered on the doorbell as he heard it beeping and buzzing from the other side while he looked back in fear as Neff, then Lenk rushed up to the gate. Raiden turned, pressing his back to the door as he watched. Why had he come here? He was so screwed… Lenk took a step forward but Neff grabbed his shoulder.

“[No. That crazy lady lives here.]” The two thugs glanced at one another for a moment, then back at Raiden, considering their options. “[You have to get lucky every time Raiden! We only have to get lucky once!]” Neff threatened before they backed up. Raiden felt the door behind his back start to open and he quickly leaned forward so he didn’t fall backwards when the door was opened.

Turning around just as it opened he was faced with a dark figure silhouetted against the light from inside, his eyes taking a moment to adjust. First he noticed the horns, which meant a Davari. They were rather wide too, no doubt bulky with muscles. Then his eyes went to some kind of claw weapon in their right hand. He was so screwed. But then the figure stepped forward into view. “Oh deary me are you alright? I saw those young ruffians chasing you.”

Raiden was face to face with an old Davari woman. The hair around her temples was grey, and her horns had begun to bleach white with age. She was wearing an oversized shirt with sunflowers on it, an old set of sweatpants, and some big rubbed galoshes on her feet. The claw thing she was holding in one hand was matched by a small digging trowel in the other. Also, had she spoken to him in English? Had he imagined that? “Uh… thank you. Uhm…” His eyes did return to the claw she held.

Noticing his stare she looked down and then held it up. “Oh! My claw? It’s just for gardening work. I’m sorry if I gave you a fright, you caught me just before I was going to tend to my garden. I only moved in recently so I need to get the bulbs in and get them growing! Bring some life to this little place.” Her big bright smile was comforting. “Now, did you just try to seek shelter here young man?”

“Oh uhm… no. I uh… Package.” Raiden’s breath was a bit ragged as his body seemed to catch up with what was happening. Slipping the pack off his shoulders he opened it up and rummaged around to pull out the box for her.

“Oh! You’re from that pawn shop? Wonderful. It’s my heart medication. The ticker just can’t handle the church orgies like it used to.” She let out a deep laugh that filled the air even as Raiden blushed at her comment.

“Could I… get water?” He asked next.

“Oh yes, you must be tired from running! Yes yes, come on in.” She waved him in then, setting the claw and little trowel down on a table near the door. Looking around the room he noticed a lot of paintings that were splashes of colors that didn’t seem to form anything but still had a… happy vibe to them? He also noticed lots of pictures of flowers and plants and the old lady standing in front of various buildings or landmarks. He noticed a lot from Partizania Rai, the tropical resort world.

There were also lots of pictures and paintings of cartoonish, happy animals. Cats, dogs, Vukos, Quibs, Lormites, even some kind of bushy tailed orange thing he’d never seen. She led him into a kitchen that was as big as the apartment he lived in and waved for him to sit at a giant wooden table. “Would you like some water sweetie?” She asked and he nodded as she grabbed a glass covered in dancing bunnies and filled it from a spout in her fridge. He blinked as he looked at her giant fridge. It actually had an ice and water dispenser on the front! He’d seen it in vids but never in person.

“Now, you just sit a moment and catch your breath sweetie. I’m just going to make sure it’s the right medication. Is that okay?” As she asked that Raiden nodded and grabbed the glass, gulping at the water as he suddenly found himself far more thirsty than he realized. The old Davari lady just smiled and took the box as she shuffled off into another room. 

Agnivra frowned as she looked at the box in her hand. Everything looked to be in order except a small hand written note just under the label. “Exceptional Service Guaranteed! No good neighbor is beyond our reach! Check out our web hotline service immediately for a special vibrant offer! These offers aren’t dreams! Awaken to the truth, of our low low deals!” To any normal person it would just be a slightly odd ad for the business. But to particular people it held a very different meaning. Pulling out a slate she returned to the Pawn Shop’s website. Scanning the page she then clicked on a very small icon that nearly looked like just part of the background.

A customer review template popped up asking her to fill in a username. Ignoring the usual suggestions she quickly typed in a set of keywords and then hit the button to talk to a rep. There was a delay and then a message popped up. “Reliqua non est aeternum.”

“Ooohh…” She bit her lower lip a moment as she scratched her head. “Nemo nostrum est quam ira.” She typed in and sent. Then immediately followed up. “Quam irae nemo nostrum.” Was that it? “Listen, no one is beyond our wrath. I can’t remember all the phrases exactly. Sierra Triumvirate Helios Roulette 34275. Sleeper activated.”

She was worried what would happen for a moment but then let out a sigh of relief when the next message popped up. “I doubt my Latin is any better. Welcome back to the fold agent. You’ve been gone quite a while. You’re not due to retire yet. I’ll overlook any lapses in service provided you understand that work is to be done immediately.”

Agnivra looked back at the door, knowing the young man was still in her kitchen. “Am I to kill the messenger?”

“No.” She let out another sigh of relief. She hated killing the young. It was bad form. “Observe his performance. If anyone is hindering him determine if they’re hostile agents or just local noise.”

“Two locals were spotted chasing him to this residence.” She returned.

“Then research them. If they’re working for anyone else, deal with them.” Came the reply.

“Specific termination, or dealer’s choice?” She sent back.

“Dealer’s choice.” She thought about that a moment.

“Good, my garden is in need of fertilizer. Additional objectives at this time? Handler ID?” Who was it who had called her back after all this time? How had they found her?

“No further details. Agent Autumn, I hope you remember how to kill. Handler out.” The message board vanished.

“Hhhmmm…” Angivra rubbed her chin. They were being coy. “Young man. Would you like something to eat? I bet you’re hungry!” She tucked the slate away and shuffled back towards the kitchen with a big smile. She’d see what the boy knew. If she was being awakened then she wanted to know if she was killing for a cause, or a criminal. Either way she had a feeling her garden would thrive in this city.",/r/HFY/comments/ko3k12/pawn_ch_3/,22

&amp;nbsp;

  

It was slow-moving in the ‘ducts’, although Beau hesitated to call them that. There were too many things about them that made his gut twist. They were body heat warm, cramped enough that the pleather feeling walls slid against his skin and dark enough to multiply the creepy-as-hell factor by about a billion.

Even though he was at the helm of their expedition, their progress was slowed due to the irregular placement of the snotball cameras. They sat in the bottom of the shaft, in clear, concave, open-faced covers. He had made the mistake of pushing his entire left arm through one before, and was now covered in alien fluids. It smelled like ass.

Beau had been trying to keep track of how far he and Ryo had travelled, but he had lost count somewhere around the first camera crushing incident. They had to have gone at least a few clicks though, and with no end in sight their ‘prison’ must be huge. 

“You holding up okay, Ryo?” he called over his shoulder.  
“yes,” came the teenage groan in reply.

“That’s good, cause this is some real *bullshit.* Bet you never figured you’d ever have to crawl down some janky-ass, alien spaceship.”

“No.” The reply was annoyed this time, but Beau didn’t feel like staying quiet. There was only so much he could hold in without it causing problems later.

“I’d always thought I’d be on the ground, fighting the ‘good fight’ as it were, not that an alien invasion was the first thing on my mind. Figured someone would have pushed the red button before aliens…” Beau wiped the sweat from his brow. “What were you doing before your life was up-ended?”

Ryo groaned louder, stopping his crawl to answer his question.

“Camping,” was the answer.

“Heh, you too? Jesus it’s a small world. Me and a couple of buddies were just sitting around a campfire talking about the not-so-good old days, then next thing we know, our dogs were barking like crazy and a bright light blinded me…” Beau stopped and took a breather. His limbs were starting to complain about the cramped conditions, laying down flat and stretching. “You in school, Ryo?”

“Yes,” Sugawara lied.

“That’s good, you should stick with it.  What are you studying?”

There was another long pause as the boy tried to remember the right words, finally setting on, “Science,” with a grunt.

“That’s going to come in handy. You handle the brains, I’ll take care of the brawn!” Beau replied, catching himself getting louder. Why was he shouting? The last thing they needed was to be heard.

He held his breath and listened.

There was a humming, just loud enough that he couldn’t ignore it, a creepy, wet, pulsating noise. It swelled and levelled with the rhythm of a laboured heart. The soldier followed the noise with his fingers. He could feel it in the veins that ran along the walls. 

The objective to escape was becoming an increasingly urgent priority.

  
  

They had no choice but to keep moving forward, only at a slower pace than he would have liked. Ryo was sounding a little out of breath. 

“I wanted to go to school,” Beau breathed quietly, reigning himself in, “to become a veterinarian, get outta Smallville, but life didn’t turn out that way. Plans rarely make it out the other end intact.” 

He fought the urge to shout, to lash out, to turn the alien taser on the walls themselves and cut their way out. 

Objective list:

Keep moving forward.

Keep civilian on side.

Stay alive.

“You wanna tell me about yourself, Ryo?”

“... No.”

“Alright, we’ll just listen to the creepy pulsing alien tube then,” he snapped. The dark and claustrophobic environment was getting to him. “I ain’t tryna rub you the wrong way man, just trying to get to know you.” Beau peered back over his shoulder, correcting the harshness in his voice. “You’re doing pretty good actually, I know grown men who would have turned into jello if they were in your position.”

“...” Ryo didn’t respond. Whether that was a translation problem, he didn’t know.

Beau stopped in his tracks.

Up ahead, a small, glowing light appeared. It bobbed from side to side, growing closer.

Ryo’s hand touched Beau’s foot, nearly knocking into him from behind.  
“Down,” Beau whispered and he dropped flat on his stomach, reaching for the alien taser and aiming it at the light, in case it decided to be hostile.

They lay absolutely still, breathing shallowly as the light came closer. Beau could hear a quiet but distinct whistle echo down the tubes.

As his eyes adjusted to the light, he saw it was being held by a long black arm, a mass of tentacles coiled around a bioluminescent orb. 

To the soldier, it could only be described as a black octopus wearing a tool belt, and it was happily whistling as it inspected the tube. It didn’t even seem to notice them at first, slinking over to an open camera in the floor, spraying it with some sort of bottle that it wore around its ‘waist’. The alien black octopus purred and tapped the goopy camera with a free tentacle, dripping the contents of another bottle of fluid over its surface. 

Beau waited, taser ready, but the alien just whistled and purred to itself. Then it noticed them.

“Hold still,” he whispered back to Ryo as the curious little creature approached.

It looked over them both with its single big eye, shining the light on them both. Beau saw the resemblance instantly, now he knew what the cameras were made of. The alien squeaked, and a single tentacle reached out. Instinctually, Beau returned the gesture, offering his hand for it to inspect.

The creature took it gladly, purring as it coiled its slinky arm around Beau’s fingers.

It tickled.

Beau then moved forward, gently stroking the creature’s head. The alien really liked that, pressing itself into the pets and whistling loudly in return.

*Beep beep! Beep beep! Beep beep!*

A timer on the alien’s belt sounded off, a string of happy whistles before it promptly turned around to scuttle back down the path it came by, carrying the light with it.  
“What happen?” Ryo asked.

“I...I don’t know.” The soldier wasn’t quite sure how to answer. By all rights he should have skewered the walking seafood, but his gut told him otherwise. “There’s a way out, we just need to keep moving,”

With newfound vigour, Beau began crawling forward.

  

\-\*-

  

It wasn’t much longer before the light at the end of the tunnel manifested, metaphorically and literally.  
Bright light poured in and the anxiety inside the humans melted away as the shaft opened up enough that they could stand for the first time in hours.

Their feet touched down onto cold, white tiles. Their fleshy prison had come to an end.

“Oh thank God.”

As their eyes adjusted to the light of their new environment, they observed the disparity between it and the old one. This place was huge and open compared to the tunnels, and alight with harsh fluorescence.

Behind them was a wall of tunnels, with more little alien octopuses moving in and out of them, scaling the walls like gravity wasn’t a thing.

“Whoa..” Ryo breathed, staring up towards the light.

Beau turned from the living tunnel system to the new room before them and it was no more familiar.

Rows and rows of box-like apartments were stacked on top of each other in a never-ending sprawl, each one just the right size for the alien squids.

“You think they live here?” Beau suggested, looking for any dangers in their surroundings, more guards or cameras. “Or they prisoners like us?”

  

Sugawara walked over to one of the habitats. There must have been hundreds, thousands of the things, each one with its own nest-like bed, water and food pipes just as in their prison cell, only these guys appeared to be able to come and go as they pleased. He saw more personal items in each one - baubles he had no hope of identifying, some sort of glowing orb of light, a tool belt sat to one side. If they were prisoners too, these octopuses were treated marginally better than they humans had been.

For the most part, the squid aliens themselves were curious, but treated the humans as though they were in the way, rather than like the escapees they actually were, happy to go about their business and even walk around the pair if they stood in their direct path. For whatever reason, these aliens were unconcerned with the entirely new species roaming around their living quarters.

“Oh hey, little guy..” the American whispered. Sugawara watched as the alien from the tunnels came up to the man’s knee, pawing with five of its numerous legs. Beau’s voice seemed softer in this new environment, treating the alien like an animal rather than the potential threat it should have been. 

Sugawara frowned incredulously. 

“Leave!” he snapped, hoping to scare off the creature and knock some sense into the older man. Beau shot Sugawara a mean glare, the kind that froze him to the spot.

“Cut that out.” The menacing growl was quiet enough that the alien didn’t notice, but Sugawara felt the scorn.

The soldier crouched down to pet the squid. 

It was inky black like the cameras, shiny but not slimy, and it seemed to enjoy being petted.

“They aren’t the same as the bugs,” Beau warned his companion. “No sense making enemies where we don’t need to.”

Sugawara gritted his teeth and hissed a curse.

The purrs and coos the creature produced caused a few other squids to start approaching Beau, looking for the source of the other’s enjoyment.

“Hey hey, one at a time,” Beau responded, but the aliens clearly didn’t understand. They began climbing over each other to try and touch the human, never malicious, just curious.

The youth turned his back, leaving Beau to figure out his predicament alone, while he did some reconnaissance.

As he walked, heading deeper into the apartment complex, he fumed under his breath.

*Nobody talked to him like that.* If they hadn’t been stuck in the hell they were in now, Beau would have regretted even trying to threaten him.

*“Who does he think he is? I’m not a fucking child!”* he seethed under his breath. They were surrounded by the enemy and the guy was acting as though they were at a petting zoo.

As Suga walked the halls he found little gathering spots where the creatures munched on their kibble bits, or sat around a glowing ball whistling to each other. They were completely ignorant of the storm brewing in his mind, lost in whatever passed for entertainment in this sterile environment.

Then he turned a corner and another burst of bright light drew his eye to the centre of the complex. Flashing and blazing with glory stood a giant pale blue bug, duelling another with taser swords.

Sugawara stood gobsmacked as he watched the scene unfold. The warriors were in no rush to arrest him, they danced meters above the actual ground, to the entertainment of the squids. More than a hundred of the aliens were sitting in an amphitheatre several steps deep, watching a holographic ‘play’ in the middle. 

The hologram was fascinating, the pair of bugs posturing and flourishing capes as they struck each other. A mass of screaming clicks and whistles substituted for words as the squids all bounced along to it.

To say it was surreal was the understatement of the fucking century.

The warriors thrust blades toward one another, shattering upon impact, a flash of light exaggerating the moment like a movie explosion.

Sugawara lifted his hand to shield his eyes and felt a tight grip on his shoulder.

*‘What are you doing standing around?!’*

Sugawara‘s head jerked in search of the voice. The hand on his shoulder was gone, but his heart raced like it used to.

That wasn’t good. That wasn’t good at all.

He looked down at his own hand and saw nothing.

It would only get worse from here on out. He’d have to be careful.

Sugawara backed away from the light display, returning down the hall to find the American covered in the curious squids.

“Hey, Ryo! These guys are much friendlier than those other assholes,” Beau greeted him, seemingly having forgotten their prior conflict. Sugawara sighed through his nose in response, unimpressed with the antics of a man nearly 15 years his senior.

One of the squids tore away from the pack and tried to get the younger man’s attention. With a silent snarl, Sugawara gently shoved it away with his foot. The squid blurted out a small squeak of surprise before it scuttled off.

He found a spot on the floor to sit down, out of the other man’s line of sight, while he pulled out the alien weapon from his hip in order to get a closer look. It was like a baton, weighted and solid in his hands, with a large wheel-like dial on the hilt where the blade should have been. The sword wasn’t shaped for his hands but he did his best to find a grip, placing his thumb on the ‘wheel’ and moving it slowly as he had seen the hologram duelist do.

With every turn the ‘blade’ of the taser grew longer or shorter, explaining the sudden thrusting movements that they had been attacked with.

There were a few other buttons and dials. He pressed the one closest to his thumb and the entire blade was engulfed in the hum and crackle of electricity. He nearly dropped the thing then and there, but pressing the button for the second time turned off the taser. He wasn’t as confident with touching the rest in case he electrocuted himself, or it spontaneously self-destructed. For now, a giant metal spear with lightning damage was better than nothing. He turned back the dial so the blade slid neatly back inside its shaft, and tucked it into his loincloth before deciding to bring his findings to his companion’s attention.

  

Beau had since gotten the squids to an orderly sort of formation. Those that tried to cut in front were harshly hissed at by their fellow squids. Some of them were bringing bits of food, dropping them on Beau’s lap, trying to barter for more pettings.

“Hey, the food is great and all,” he said, biting into one of the offered up kibble bits, “but how about you get us some more of this, huh?” He showed them the fabric of his torn loincloth. “You’ll get some serious love if you find me some new threads.”

A few of them whistled and hurried off to God knows where. Beau’s lips curved, proud of himself for establishing contact, securing food and a means of trade. 

He watched as the sulking teenager came back, having finished whatever business he had in the alien complex. 

“Yo Ryo, you find anything? A way out?” he asked.

  

The kid shook his head but pulled out the alien weapon and with a quick flick of the wrist and flourish of his thumb, the taser sword crackled with lightning, scaring off any other would-be pettees.

“Now that’s what I’m talking about…!” Beau smirked. Copying Sugawara’s movements exactly, he soon mastered his own taser sword. “We’re no longer unarmed, that’s one less thing to worry about. So, I’m thinking these guys are the workers, keeping whatever it is in the tunnels running, might be the whole damn ship…” 

Suga nodded. “I count, uhh, one, two, zero, zero, zero.”

“One two?... wait, you mean 12,000? 12,000 what?” Suga nodded his head, pointing to the apartment blocks.

“That’s a lot of maintenance workers…” Beau whistled. The ship must be huge. “We need to find a way out of here.”

The few squids that had run off returned, this time carrying, some-*fucking*\-how, lab coats, made from the same pleathery material as the walls of the tunnels.

“This just keeps getting better and better!” Beau half laughed.

The coat was too small for him but fit Ryo well enough. The kid even got to roll up his sleeves.

He would have to make do with an even larger loincloth. At least now there wasn’t as much of a breeze downstairs.

Beau looked at their options. They could keep wandering aimlessly down dark tunnels, away from the more dangerous aliens but without any way of knowing where they were they would end up. 

They could try walking the hallways, but they were two men, one not even trained, under surveillance, against an armed and dangerous enemy in their home territory. Beau’s joints protested, but it wasn’t exactly a hard choice.

“So, we know *that* tunnel leads to our cell, armed guards and a dead end. You wanna pick our next route?”

The kid looked about as happy with their options as he was. Shoulders slumped, he pointed to another tunnel, higher up off the ground. Beau stared at it a moment. Higher ground might not be the worst idea.

“Alright then, going up.”

(Just pretend like I wrote this all *auf Deutsch.*)

+Anneke+

""So, Miss Taggart. You say that you traveled to an alien world, where you met elves, trolls, and a psychic dinosaur. And were rescued by other humans.""

I was strapped into a chair in a building I hadn't seen the outside of. I'd been home for about a month before I got grabbed off the street and dragged into a van. The lights pointing at my face were very bright. I was starting to think that maybe I should have listened to the advice Fess had given me about claiming I had just run away.

""I've already told you all of this a dozen times.""

""Well, let's just go over it one more time.""

There was a coldness in my arm as something ran through the IV stuck in my elbow. My thoughts started to get rather fuzzy. This was honestly even more terrifying than when I thought I was going to get eaten by trolls.

""When my boyfriend gets back to Earth, he's going to kick your ass.""

""That would be this Hephaestus person?""

""That's him.""

""What do we have on him?"" He seemed to be talking to someone else.

A voice answered from a speaker. ""Amos Tiomod MacArthur. Forty-four. American. Not much of note in the files. Typical american gun nut, did software for a while. Apparently he wasn't very good at it, now he's a truck driver.""

""You're sleeping with a 44 year old wannabe terrorist, Miss Taggart? A bit old for you, no?""

""He wouldn't sleep with me. He said I was too young. Stupid honorable bastard.""

""But you call him your boyfriend.""

""Well, he said he wanted to be, before he sent me back.""

""Come now, drop this ridiculous story about elves. I understand that it was traumatic when he kidnapped you, but we must come back to reality.""

""He didn't kidnap me! He rescued me!""

""And used this to bring you into his bed.""

""He didn't sleep with me! I'm still a virgin, you stupid asshole. You want to check?!""

""Have you considered the possibility that he's using you?""

""If *only*. I *tried* to get him to use me. He kept saying no. Mmmmm. I wish he **had** used me. Over and over… God that man is hot.""

""Perhaps we're getting off track.""

""You're definitely off track. You'd better let me go or he's going to be pissed at you. Things don't seem to go well for people he gets pissed at.""

""I think we can handle one american trucker.""

""You're a fucking moron. Y'know, I suspect that's exactly what the elf king was thinking before Fess **painted** the **wall** with his **brains.** And the leader of the first troll army that he destroyed. And the leader of the *second* troll army that he wiped out ninety percent of in ten minutes. Maybe you're starting to see a pattern here?""

""Like I said, Miss Taggart, I think we'll be just fine.""

""And I think you're going to have a very unpleasant surprise. How ironic. My boyfriend is going to fuck **you** long before he fucks **me.**""

The cold in my arm got more intense, and things started fading out. The man asked more questions, and I think I answered, but I don't know for sure.

Oh Fess, my love… please come back soon. I think I'm in real trouble here.

32,kognp4,HFY,Fri Jan  1 20:54:43 2021,Death's Trial; Stage 1-2,"“Mary!” Martino started as his eyes opened, momentarily looking at the text floating before him in shock before relaxing back to the floor, “I’m never going to get used to that.”

“Lucky for you the creatures seem to have mostly departed,” Tsubasa replied from where he knelt on the ground, looking at his own messages with brow furrowed in thought.

“You two are too loud,” Nik grumbled from his side, earning skeptical looks from the others who hadn’t even noticed him being awake. After waking Amy they all took a minute to read over their messages.

“This ‘Armok’ guy is very… wordy,” Martino commented, “seems to think that just because we’re human we should all get along.”

“Ha,” Nik snorted a single humorless laugh, “these… beings really want us to be friends or some shit.”

“Several are saying the farms are secondary,” Tsubasa said slowly, “while others really seem to want us to burn them.”

“Michael tells me to burn them,” Amy spoke up softly, “they only feed demons and the sinful. I think we should destroy them.”

“He tell you anything else?” Nik asked, trying to hide his interest.

“There are demons trying to divide us,” she replied after a moment, “and that I am tasked with leading you all to salvation.”

“If this really is some sort of hell, or purgatory, or whatever, maybe destroying those farms would be fore the best,” agreed Nik while looking between Martino and Tsubasa with suspicion.

“At least none of them are asking us to sacrifice something to them, right?” Martino joked with a lopsided grin to hide how closely he was watching the others.

“There’s one asking us to tell more about ourselves,” Tsubasa spoke up when no one replied to Martino.

“I’m not here for story time,” Nik spat, “I’ll confess to a priest not to you.”

“I agree,” Martino replied, “we should get moving, not waste time speaking of our sins. If these Beings are really angels and demons, then they already know what we did.”

“Fine,” Tsubasa sighed, standing and making for the door, “let’s make sure we’re clear then we can see to ourselves before moving on.”

“Maybe the farms will have food for us,” Martino added as he helped Tsubasa clear the blockage from the door, “I don’t know about you all but I’m hungry.”

“I was trained to go over a week without food,” Nik grumbled, Tsubasa said nothing, glancing up and down the road. Once they were sure it was clear Tsubasa excused himself to duck around a corner to relieve himself.

“I don’t know if you… Beings can hear me,” Tsubasa whispered once he was alone, “but my Lord asked me and my fellow Samurai to burn several towns for not paying their tax, to put all their residence to the sword. But I knew he’d already demanded several times more in tithes than they could handle. Combined with blight on the crops they could barely feed themselves. All so he could raise an army over some slight.

“I swore to serve him, but…” the man stopped mid-sentence and shook his head, seeming to not know how to finish that thought.

“Took your sweet time,” Nik commented as Tsubasa finally returned, “while you were gone we decided to head east, several of the comments seem to point us that way.”

“Sun rose over there,” Martino added, pointing back over the building they had stayed in. Being on the edge of town they followed the river east for a short distance before it began to curve away to the south. After a short discussion they chose to head north to stay by the town itself, picking their way through rough, rocky terrain and forests before nearly stumbling onto another road with several buildings in view to the west.

“I still don’t see any farms,” Martino grumbled as they made their way back to the edge of the town. Without a word Nik scrambled up a tree, jumping from it to grab the tiled roof of a building and haul himself up, he took a moment to look around before jumping back to the ground with surprising agility.

“There are farms North of here,” he explained, “I also saw some movement further into town.”

“More of those… things,” Martino shivered.

“Let us move fast then,” Tsubasa replied, no one argued for once and they followed the town around the rocky forests that surrounded it, skirting by buildings and trying to avoid the main roads as much as they could. Nik lead the way, followed by Tusbasa, Amy and Martino. A few times they had to duck into cover as a twisted abomination skated by on boneless legs.

Between their careful progress and hiding to avoid the monsters by the time they reached the first field of what appeared to be corn the sun was approaching its Zenith.

“I’m not a fan of Corn in general,” Martino commented reaching for an ear, “but I won’t say no t- HOLY MARY!”

He stumbled backwards falling onto his ass, shocked by what he’d seen as he pulled away the husk of the corn. Peering out from the course fibers was not corn but eyeballs, all different sizes and colors staring at him, unblinking. Tsubasa stepped away for a moment to cover his mouth as bile rose in his throat at the sight, while Nik scowled at the eyes in disgust.

“I had felt some… hesitation at burning crops,” Tsubasa commented as he returned, holding a dry stick he’d wrapped in straw gathered from the ground, “but not anymore.”

“Let’s get this over with,” Nik grumbled, “anyone got see any flint on the way?”

“I’ll rig up a block and bow to-,” Tsubasa started only to be interrupted by a scratch and hiss followed by his makeshift torch catching fire. The other two men looked at Martino in surprise as he held the match to a short cigar in his mouth before waving it out.

“What?” the confused Martino asked, “one of you need a light?”

“The smell might attract those creatures,” Nik replied.

“I haven’t eaten or had a smoke for over a day,” Martino replied in a dangerous voice, breath heavy with smoke, “and after all of this I could use one.”

“The fire should cover the… smell,” Tsubasa added, holding the now burning torch to the nearest eye-corn plant which took a moment before taking a steady flame.

“Fine,” Nik growled before holding his hand out to Martino, “in that case give me one too.”

“Gladly,” Martino smiled widely, pulling another one from a pocket of his trousers. Once Nik was grumbling about cheap American tobacco Tsubasa had set several more fires along the edge of the field and they had begun to spread.

“Was something supposed to happen?” Martino asked between drags on his cigarette, “a clue or something?”

Before anyone could reply they all froze as a distant ghostly howl echoed over the roaring flames. Barely pausing to exchange a glance they rushed back towards the town, ducking into a building, more howls answering the first as the smoke from their fire climbed into the sky.

((Objective complete: Burn a farm; see comments for rewards))

“Well, someone tell me that wasn’t a complete waste of time?” Martino asked, taking one last drag before stomping out the remains of his cigarette.

“I got another message from Micheal,” Amy spoke up, “he said the bell is in the center of town, a tainted church dedicated to the Morning Star.”

“So they did know,” Nik cursed.

“He couldn’t tell us till we demonstrated our trust in Him,” she added, “he’s also trying to get us more help, but we’ll have to pray.”

“I didn’t get any new messages,” Tsubasa replied skeptically.

“I was told it’s my job to lead,” Amy said softly, looking at the ground nervously, “maybe he can only message me?”

“Near as I can see messages arrive in waves, why would this one arrive on its own?”

“I- I,” Amy started, tears starting to form in her eyes.

“Easy, easy,” Martino soothed, once again stepping between them, “it shouldn’t be hard to check, and it’s not like we have another place to search.”

“I saw most of those… creatures near the center of town,” Nik added, “we might have to fight more of them.”

“Then they might be guarding the bell,” replied Martino.

“We’ll have a hard time moving again today,” Nik commented, glancing carefully out of the shuttered window of the building they hid in, “lots of those things being drawn to the flames.”

“Looks like they’re forming a bucket chain,” Tsubasa added softly, motioning to a line of them forming on the south end of the field that lead towards the river.

“Then we better pray for water, or better yet, beer,” Martino said with a sigh as he settled down against one wall, “don’t suppose any of you have a deck of cards?”

*Transcript begins 6 seconds in:*

**Meredith Walker**: ...thank you for joining us here as we continue our coverage of the first annual Victory Day celebrations with SNN’s exclusive interview with all three ‘Heroes of the Liberation’. They have not been seen in public since Victory Day itself and we are very honoured to have them all here. 

*SNN News Hour Ident; return to studio*

**Meredith Walker**: So on my right is Dr Li Huning, Head of Xenobiology at the University of Beijing, former member of the U.N.A.L.C. and recently appointed member of the Standing Committee of the Politburo of the People’s Republic of China... 


**Dr Li Huning**: Hello Ms. Walker


**Meredith Walker**: Of course we have Admiral Sir William Patterson, of the British Royal Navy, named by Time Magazine ‘the greatest military genius in human history’ and newly appointed Commander in Chief of the Allied Earth Interstellar Fleet...


**Sir William Patterson**: Thank You Meredith.  Good evening everyone.


**Meredith Walker**: And finally we have Yolanda Yaltzer, writer, director, producer, fashion designer, social media influencer and author of the best selling book ‘Don’t you screw with me alien boi’


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: I am like stoked to be here right now. Like we are actually talking to like the ENTIRE world? That’s wild!


**Meredith Walker**: Thank you Miss Yaltzer


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: Call me Yo-Yo as in the Haus of Yo-Yo. That’s my new fashion range name by the way. 


**Meredith Walker**: Indeed. Thank you. Now before we start a brief reminder of the achievements of the Three Heroes and our glorious victory...


(Video segment; 6 minutes long; video ends; commercial; end of commercial Meredith Walker reintroduced the three)


**Meredith Walker**: So, I have to ask- 26 years ago- 2063; where were you when the invasion took place?


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: Like OhMYGawd, I was in bed. So, I was at High School but was at home that day cos I had mono. My family lived in San Fernando and I remember seeing those spaceships on TV and was all ‘Am I tripping balls?’ cos I was like worried the mono was making me all freaky...


**Sir William Patterson**: I was at also at my parents home when they arrived. We lived in Wiltshire. I’d just graduated from Queens Cambridge. 


**Meredith Walker**: So you were not a member of the military back then Sir William?


**Sir William Patterson**: Far from it. I was a newly minted holder of a masters in 18th Century European Literature. I joined the Royal Navy a week after our surrender. Many people joined their militaries after that back then. 


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: You know what’s weird? I’ve liked watched EVERY single Hollywood movie ever made about aliens invading Earth and like they ALWAYS show space ships over America and shiz.  But when it happened? They all freaking appeared over China! Like China!  No offence Doc. But I think we were not prepared for the reality of an alien invasion. 


**Sir William Patterson**: Well, they targeted the top 24 largest cities on Earth as you know and only New York made that list; China ended up with six ships hovering above them and India had five, with Lahore being close but...


**Dr Li Huning**: I was in Shanghai when they arrived 


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: No! Freaking! Way! You never told me that Doc! Gee, you think you know a guy...


**Dr Li Huning**: I remember the panic. The vast leviathan above us. Its immensity. I knew then, I think we all knew then, that there would be little fighting. Their sheer size. The absolute power of them. 


**Meredith Walker**: Indeed Doctor. And three weeks later Prime Minister Akoshi of Japan surrendered on behalf of the human species. Some feel that he acted hastily, unilaterally, that we should have at least tried...


**Sir William Patterson**: No, I’m sorry Meredith, but that’s revisionism. We had then, as now, no weapons capable of combatting the Vorton.  I’ve seen what their ships can do. We would have been annihilated. 


**Dr Li Huning**: Akoshi was Prime Minister of Japan and Tokyo was the largest city in Earth. The Vorton believed it was the main centre of human life. They insisted upon him representing all humans. My government, all governments, agreed. 


**Meredith Walker**: The North Koreans didn’t. 


**Sir William Patterson**: And that’s why there is no North Korea anymore Meredith. 


**Dr Li Huning**: What happened there convinced us all. All governments. It was pointless fighting them. Akoshi was just unlucky to be the man who had to kowtow. 


**Meredith Walker**: And with that, as we all know, the occupation began...


**Dr Li Huning**: It was hardly an occupation Miss Walker. Only a handful of Vorton ever came to Earth. 


**Meredith Walker**: You met with the Vorton very early on didn’t you Dr Li?


**Dr Li Huning**: Yes. My position then was Head of Astrobiology at University of Shanghai. My government felt this would give me some insight into the creatures. So I was asked to join the United Nations Alien Liaison  Committee in Geneva. We alone would meet with the Exarch and it’s three advisors. 


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: And Vorton were like SO freaky. First time I actually met one? Half of me wanted to scream and half of me wanted to hurl. Like super-chunks. They were so large and weirdly shaped. Kinda like some kinky dildo. 


**Meredith Walker**: The first nine years then of the occupation...


**Dr Li Huning**: Again. Not an occupation. We humans had submitted. We were a client planet for the Vorton Ascendency. One of a dozen such planets. They demand we provide whatever they wished for and in return for allowing them take it we would be left alone. 


**Meredith Walker**: But members of the race would travel to earth to destroy large parts of the planet, the operations they carried out...


**Dr Li Huning**: When they stripped mined Alberta? Only five Vorton operated those machines. They sought the shale gas, informed us of their intention, landed, and took it. Five Vorton, two machines. Not an occupation. 


**Meredith Walker**: But they destroyed over 43 million hectors of virgin wilderness...


**Dr Li Huning**: I do not justify what they did. Nor try to present it in a way other than what it was. We had encountered an alien species many times more powerful than us. They could have destroyed the human race in a moment. We just complied because we had no choice. 


**Meredith Walker**: And yet critics maintain an active resistance would have dissuaded them from doing such things. 


**Sir William Patterson**: Those critics are idiots. 


**Meredith Walker**: Harsh words Sir William. 


**Sir William Patterson**: Yes they only had a handful of Vorton on Earth but they only NEEDED a handful. They were a hive mind. What one saw they all saw. 


**Dr Li Huning**: Many, even today, say we should have killed isolated Vorton as a sign of resistance. This would have been foolish. If we killed one the whole race would know. 


**Meredith Walker**: But those critics insist that had we acted fast enough...


**Dr Li Huning**: They do not understand quantum biology Ms Walker. Those critics brandish ideas around like ‘a bomb acts quicker than the speed of thought’.  These ideas are foolish. Vorton minds were linked in a much more complex way. Complex Quantum entanglement captured in biological form. If we killed one the entire species would know of its death. Instant communication over a dozen planets. 


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: Like, can you IMAGINE taking a dump and EVERYONE knows your dropping? Like GAWD!


**Sir William Patterson**: I must echo Dr Li’s words here Meredith. The Vorton species was, until recently, the most formidable race in the galaxy. A collective hive mind, driven by a single purpose. I dedicated my life to fighting them as you know, and have been told I helped defeat them. Well then, with those credentials allow me say- Those critics who wish we had done more those first ten years or so, they do not know what they are talking about. 


**Dr Li Huning**: The Vorton didn’t occupy us. They took what they wanted and left us alone. They desired all subject races be useful for them is all. We were not and until we could be, our planet was judged useful. This was why they took the shale and the copper and the zinc...


**Meredith Walker**: Useful. Interesting choice of words Dr Li. You refer, of course, to the Paris experiments?


**Dr Li Huning**: I was not involved in those projects. 


**Meredith Walker**: But you knew off them?


**Dr Li Huning**: The Liaison Committee approved of the attempt to see if humans could connect to the Vorton hive mind. 


**Meredith Walker**: Even at the cost...


**Dr Li Huning**: All those who died were volunteers. 


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: Ohhhhhh the brain melting? Oh that was SUPER gnarly. I saw pictures of that stuff after I got security clearance. Like we are talking Mr Bufu! I mean Lord-God-King-Bufu. It was as grim as balls. 


**Dr Li Huning**: Human brains could not merge with Vorton. We had the base structure but in their words their brains were a million times more complex. We were not as useful to them as our planet was. We would not be seen as useful until after the creation of the films. 


**Meredith Walker**: Now that leads us onto a subject many are curious about. The Human-Vorton film industry. Dr Li- how did it all start? 


**Dr Li Huning**: I would ask Miss Yeltzer, she was the most successful exponent of it. 


**Meredith Walker**: Yes but who was it who brought her in- whose idea it in the first place?


**Dr Li Huning**: You misunderstand. We did not bring Miss Yeltzer into this. She brought us into it. 


**Meredith Walker**: Miss Yeltzer? 


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: Hel-Lo! Yeah. Oh I know this one. So it’s likes SUPER convoluted. But like really if you gotta pick a day when the whole thing started it’s when those cops in India like raided that call centre...


**Meredith Walker**: India?


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: Yah. There was this guy, some minor dweeb working there, real sweaty cubical meerkat, and he was making memes about the Vortons in his work time. Like super weird stuff, little animated films of Vortons screwing elephants. Cos like they were SO large. 


**Dr Li Huning**: This part of the story has not been declassified yet Miss Yaltzer. 


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: Oops. My bad. 


**Dr Li Huning**: Miss Yeltzer refers to a raid carried out by the Mumbai police force on a warrant issued by the Liaison Committee in Setember 2072. A series of short animations about the Vortons had began appearing on the internet, each growing in extreme content. We worried that if even one of the Vortons saw them they would all know and we would face an overreaction so we ordered the creator arrested. 


**Meredith Walker**: Sir William? You were not involved in this at the time?


**Sir William Patterson**: No, I was simply a junior officer in Whitehall at the time. It’s all Yolanda. 


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: So like I was there yar? I was freakin Ground Zero. Like not in the raid in India, obviously BUT... well I was working at a SPFX company in LA at the time. I’d graduated from the animation department at UCLA by then and like EVERYONE went there to work for Pixar and I was like ‘no way I’m gonna work for the damned mouse’. So I ended up at this little place that specialised in high end late stage rendering of CGI. And like someone sent us a copy of the Indian meme animations. And immediately I was like ‘WHOAH DUDE!’ Cos I could see there was something special. 


**Meredith Walker**: What drew you to it?


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: The detail. Like whomever rendered the image- he’d SEEN a Vorton up close. Not on TV but in the flesh. They rendered it really well. Like, maybe cos of the nature of their bodies but it was easier to cross the uncanny valley with Vorton than with humans. 


**Meredith Walker**: Cross the uncanny valley?


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: Oh yar. So when we do computer generated people on screen there is always that little thing that makes them look off. It isn’t much but we can usually always tell- that’s not a fricken human yeah?  But Vorton have much more simplistic facial features. They like are easier to render on screen and make look real. To then anyway. 


**Meredith Walker**: So what led you to make that first film?


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: Well, I’d JUST dumped this guy, he was like a yoga instructor from San Diego, and he was super into Tantra, but like, not willing to BE in the moment. And so I was like ‘no way is it worth trying to get him to actualise his feelings’ so I’d dumped his ass and I went on this super big creative trip and so was all up in my desire to make something. So I used those animations and improved on them. Improved on them a LOT. 


**Meredith Walker**: What inspired you to make a film with an all Vorton cast?


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: Like it was easy. I could use the template from the Mumbai animation and just adjusted it. Did a short film about two Vorton encountering an automated food vendor. You KNOW how fustrating those things are- you have to be SO precise. So I did this short film about two Vorton trying to get it to work. 


**Meredith Walker**: Entirely computer generated?


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: Obviously. Its not like I could like ASK a Vorton to show up. 


**Meredith Walker**: And the language barrier?


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: I used a standard translation matrix. Their language was pretty basic. 


**Meredith Walker**: Professor- why was Miss Irwins animation accepted and the previous ones not?


**Dr Li Huning**: Miss Irwin’s short film was not mocking Vorton. If anything it mocked the weakness of human AI. It was satire on our technology. The Vorton came across as very realistic, disdainfully trying to work out how to fathom something even we humans had issues with. 


**Meredith Walker**: Is this why you decided to show the Vorton delegation the film?


**Dr Li Huning**: Partly. Also we were desperate. We wanted to distract them. They were talking about a new quota. 186 million tonnes of hardwood. They were after the Indonesian rainforests. All the Indonesian rainforests. Everyone was trying to find a way for us to be ‘useful’ for them. Any idea was being considered. I saw a copy of Miss Yeltzer’s short film and decided to show it to them. 


**Meredith Walker**: And their reaction?


**Dr Li Huning**: They enjoyed it. 


**Meredith Walker**: The Exarch and his advisors?


**Dr Li Huning**: No, all of them. The entire species. The Vorton hive mind. Four watched it, 23 billion enjoyed it. They wanted more. 

**Yolanda Yaltzer**: And hey presto- 2074, the Human Vorton Entertainment industry was born. You’re welcome humanity. 


**Meredith Walker**: Which leads us to the question that many have asked over the years- why DO you think they enjoyed our movies so much?


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: Oh GAWD so many reasons. Partly it was like you know, we had been making films for SO long. Like Hollywood was SO good at it..


**Dr Li Huning**: The Vorton had never needed visual portrayals of themselves Ms Walker. They communicated with themselves instantly after all. So seeing themselves on a screen was a novelty for them. 


**Sir William Patterson**: And our film industry was merely a continuation of a long tradition of story telling, humans have been creating stories for centuries, thousands of years, after all. 


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: TOTALLY! I mean like we forget- we watch some Hollywood movie and are all like ‘its derivative and commercial’ blah blah. We forget like movies are just an extension of the human need to create narratives so as to find a sense of the freakin’ numinous. To get a small hit of what the Vorton got on a daily. Since the first ever dramatists, Kālidāsa in India, Aristophanes in Ancient Greece, narrative tales had been man’s attempt to create meaning. 


**Meredith Walker**: Er...


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: Humans seek desperatly to connect with one another. That dude Huxley said we are all ‘island universes’ you know? Each consciousness profoundly trapped within our own minds, desperately seeking commonality of experience.  It’s why we are drawn to fictional tales. We want to find a sense of empathy, of connection with one another. Movies and books and all our stories were like the Vorton hive mind. But basic you know. Like super basic. Yet even the most crude low budget film is an attempt to unite us as a species. Take porn. 


**Meredith Walker**: Porn?


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: Oh yar. Perfect example. Everyone who clicks on porn?  Bottom line their need is to see something that makes them go ‘I want that to be me’ or ‘I want to make that happen’ yar? So like porn is just like reading something weird like Lord of the Rings but without the need to imagine yourself with pointy ears. 


**Meredith Walker**: I had not...


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: Ultimately, we had been making films and doing books, hell just telling stories for aeons and it was all a low-key attempt to replicate the advanced central intelligence and experiences of the Vorton. We humans are alone and through stories and narratives seek to create constructs that allow us unite as a species. So given we had been doing that for freakin CENTURIES it meant we had such a head start when it came to translating such ideas into a moving visual medium that we were easily able to adapt to facilitate complex, nuanced and sophistication empathic responses within an alien audience. 


**Meredith Walker**: Well. I don’t think our viewers have ever heard such an explanation... Er...


**Sir William Patterson**: You know, despite how Yolanda is portrayed in the media, she does have an IQ of 163. 


**Dr Li Huning**: Yes. She would have a doctorate now if she would only maintain her studies. 


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: Please Doc. Academia is like super boring. 


**Meredith Walker**: Moving on, Professor? So Yolanda’s theory that human films replicated Vorton hive thinking was the reason they liked them?


**Dr Li Huning**: Partly. There was also a fascination with moving images of them. Vorton had a mixed sense of self. They do not exist as individuals. They are Collective. So seeing a Vorton always meant knowing a Vorton. ‘They’ and ‘me’ are one. Until they saw images of Vorton on screen. These high resolution computer images looked like them highly accurately but they could not connect to them telepathically. It intrigued them. They would focus on the images with all their attention. 


**Sir William Patterson**: And this is where language became crucial. 


**Meredith Walker**: How so Sir William?


**Sir William Patterson**: The Vorton had never developed a native language. They had not needed to. Since the species evolution they had communicated telepathically. This had allowed them evolve into apex predators on their home world. Had facilitated their technological ascendency. They only created the spoken Vorton language to communicate with the dozen client Worlds they conquered. They invented language so as to talk to non telepaths. 


**Dr Li Huning**: Yes and the language was, by their standards, simplistic and crude. After all, all other species were crude by their standards. Yet in this simplicity lay the potential for vast amounts of systemic resonance. 


**Meredith Walker**: Systemic resonance?


**Sir William Patterson**: Consider it this way Meredith. Suppose I say the word ‘blue’ to you. What comes into your mind?


**Meredith Walker**: The colour blue. 


**Sir William Patterson**: Right.  But someone else may think automatically of the sky. Or the ocean. Or the wallpaper in their nursery. 


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: Totally. It’s dependent upon the individual. Like I hear ‘blue’ and I think of the music of Robert Johnson and BB King and the blues... 


**Sir William Patterson**: Someone may think of the uniforms of Union soldiers in the American civil war. Others will think of cold. Or sadness. 


**Dr Li Huning**: A person from China would hear the word and think of wood or immortality or spring...


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: Exactly, or be like ‘oh GAWD that blue dress Shawna was wearing last week made her ass look SO fat’...


**Sir William Patterson**: But each link, each connection we can infer from the word is kept within our minds, these ‘island universes’ as Yolanda said. 


**Dr Li Huning**: But the Vorton shared all these connections with one another in real time. You say blue to a Vorton and they would instantaneously have all these thoughts and connections at once, even divergent ones and be able to reconcile these divergent reactions all within moments. 


**Sir William Patterson**: By using their simplistic language we could communicate vast amounts of meaning. 


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: It made writing scripts SUPER easy you know? Who needs careful dialogue to show a growing attraction between two Vorton? Just have one say ‘Meal. Tomorrow. Together?’ and they would fill in the blanks with like a billion variations and ideas and so forth. Not that they understood romance. 


**Dr Li Huning**: This was why for the next 12 years we humans provided films and entertainments for the Vortons. Which they rewarded with payments. Usually in the form of gold. 


**Meredith Walker**: And the Vorton just accepted these films without reservations?


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: Have you SEEN the size of my mansion?


**Dr Li Huning**: There were suspicions at first. But Miss Yolanda and a few others could produce movies showing Vortons doing things and saying things which they would watch with utter fascination. Their collective minds would fill simplistic plot and narrative with vast amounts of context, subtext and culture detail we could never guess at. Our films entertained them. And we would make sure they fit within world views the Vorton approved. We earned trust and became useful. 


**Meredith Walker**: And on that note we need a word from our sponsors. We will be right back...


*(Cut to advertisements; upon return video segment of clips of films targeted at Vorton audiences between 2077 and 2087 including ‘Destemper’ (YoYoFilms 2078); ‘Encounter on Farjo’ (UniversalWarner 2080); ‘The Enral Connundrum’ (YoYoFilms 2083; Winner Best Visual Effects; Best Sound Editing Academy Awards) and ‘Isolation’ (YoYoFilms 2086; Winner Best Adapted Screenplay; Best Director; Best Film Academy Awards)*


**Meredith Walker**: Isolation was your biggest hit wasn’t it?


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: Oh MY Gawd. They adored it. The story of one of their own cut off from the hive mind by mysterious alien tech and battling his way back to connect to his own people? They fricken LOVED that. So did the Academy Awards! But like I didn’t have to blow anyone to get liked by the Vortons!


**Meredith Walker**: Sir William when did the military become involved?


**Sir William Patterson**: We were monitoring the growth of the entertainment industry from the earliest days but we only seriously became involved in 2083. 


**Meredith Walker**: And you led that involvement?


**Sir William Patterson**: Eventually, yes. I had developed a theory at the time that the film industry would be useful to us. British Intelligence put me in contact with someone in America and this was how I became involved in Yolanda’s productions. 


**Meredith Walker**: And your first joint project?


**Sir William Patterson**: ‘Twen’. 


*(Cut to clip of the film ‘Twen’ (YoYoFilms 2087) The fictional account of the famed warleader of the Vorton species who led their first three subjugations; the clip shows the image of Twen stood before his Legions during the Battle of Nebebabn Station; the image of Twen turns to his soldiers and begins speaking- human subtitles reveal the dialogue; ‘Forward again. Forward siblings. Or neglect the dead. Before now, harmonious being was purpose. Now war. Reject briefly harmonious. Be like a feral Braan....’ clip ends)*


**Meredith Walker**: The Vorton enjoyed Twen?


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: A fricken understatement lady!


**Dr Li Huning**: It wasn’t that they enjoyed it. It was that we made it knowing they were about to invade the Gasteibians. It was basically a war movie made just before they went to war. And it actually aided them. 


**Meredith Walker**: Aided them?


**Dr Li Huning**: The Vorton Exarch informed us that the species watched Twen three times before the attack on Gasteibian. It drove them to a heightened almost fanatical sense of combat readiness. Indeed by all accounts they felt Twen helped them ruthlessly destroy all Gasteiban resistance. 


**Meredith Walker**: And Sir William was involved in making Twen?


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: Are you kidding me? He wrote the damn script. 


**Meredith Walker**: You wrote the script Admiral?


**Sir William Patterson**: Not really. Its Shakespeare. Henry V. ‘Once More onto the breach dear friends once more...’. Just simplified it to fit the Vorton language and allowed the words and images inspire their collective mind. They did the rest. 


**Meredith Walker**: But Twen was what convinced your superiors about your theory?


**Sir William Patterson**: Convinced them? No. But my superiors took my idea to NATO high command and they submitted it to the U.N. Liason Committee. 


**Dr Li Huning**: And I saw the merits in his idea. Yes. I approved the plan. Invited William and Miss Yaltzer to join me in Geneva. 


**Meredith Walker**: And that was how you all started working together then?


**Dr Li Huning**: On the Werther project? Yes. 


**Meredith Walker**: What made this special?


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: Well like firstly, the basic set up I gave them was TOTALLY killer. So the opening sequence was gonna be a magnatar crashing into a black hole and there is this massive disruption of  spacetime but also at a quantum level and BOOM! The Vortons in our story suddenly found themselves unable to talk with their minds. 


**Dr Li Huning**: The basis for the movie wasn’t scientifically accurate...


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: Oh PLEASE Doc. It was a disaster movie. No disaster movie is EVER scientifically accurate. It’s all about narrative. Disaster happens. Hero copes. Standard template. Blah blah. And cos we hadn’t like ever made a disaster movie for em before we could use like EVERY trope like cos they hadn’t seen the tropes before. It was ideal. 


**Meredith Walker**: But there was more to the film than that?


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: Oh yar! That was where sailor boy came in. He insisted we base what followed on some old book. 


**Meredith Walker**: Sir William? 


**Sir William Patterson**: Yes it was imperative we use a novel called ‘The Sorrows of Young Werther’ by Johann Von Goethe. This is the book that established  Von Goethe as one of the greats of German literature when it was published in 1774. I tried to tell Yolanda it was imperative we used this book as the basis of the story we were telling...


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: And I was like NO way. Like sure, I could see that we needed a narrative structure about individuals ‘Cos like all disaster movies do the big ‘arrrgghhhh im dying I’m dying’ routine but always make the story about basically boy meet girl and they get together while everything is blowing up, like ALL disaster movies you know, but this book? Oh GAWD! 


**Sir William Patterson**: It’s one of the greats of European literature. 


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: Its super boring Sailor Boy!  Like the protagonist, Young Werther, he is SUCH a fricken Mary Sue. He is SO what the Goethe guy wanted to be. Super super intelligent and super super sensitive. Oh so goddamn sensitive. Like BARF!


**Sir William Patterson**: The book was chosen for a reason Yolanda...


**Meredith Walker**: Rumour has it, it was you who solved the creative arguments Dr Li?


**Dr Li Huning**: Yes. I saw the dilemma- where had two vehicles designed to tell two very differing stories. On the one hand Miss Yeltzer’s desire to use a disaster movie, which we could see would work at providing an exciting narrative structure. But on the other hand we had Williams need to use the novel by Goethe. Which we needed, to fit within his overall plan. At the same time I also saw a need to include narrative elements showing the Vorton coping with their loss of telepathic abilities and wanted images showing them coming together to overcome this as a way of reinforcing Vorton belief systems. 


**Meredith Walker**: So how did you solve these conflicting ideas Dr Li?


**Dr Li Huning**: I suggested we scrap making a film and turn it into a mini series. 


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: A freakin MINI SERIES. Screw Hollywood- do Netflix. It was great. We could take our time, work in somehow all we wanted. 


**Meredith Walker**: And the Vorton enjoyed it?


**Dr Li Huning**: They could not get enough of it. The series introduced concepts they had never encountered before. Ideas they had never conceptualised. They would spend days engaged in complex debates based upon the themes we raised. And for the Vorton? Debates that last that long were unprecedented. 


**Meredith Walker**: And they didn’t suspect any ulterior purpose?


**Dr Li Huning**: They saw us react truthfully. They would invite myself and Miss Yeltzer to their mothercraft in orbit above Earth to answer questions directly from their exarch after each episode on behalf of their species. 


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: It was like a SUPER intense Q and A. Sailor boy came along with us as our bodyguard each time. 


**Dr Li Huning**: And we appeared as what we were. Humans eager to entertain them and engage them. 


**Meredith Walker**: Did you know the show would have the effect it did?


**Dr Li Huning**: Of course the possibility had been raised by Sir William. 


**Sir William Patterson**: I didn’t KNOW at all. There was a small chance it could happen. That was all. 


**Meredith Walker**: So what was it about that book that made it so important? Its a classic of literature as you said Sir William...


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: Oh please. Its a crap book. Don’t look at me like that sailor boy. It is. The Sorrows of Young Werther. Gimme a break. It’s all boring exposition. And the central story? So you have this guy Werther and he falls for this hottie but he never says anything cos he is as wet as it comes. And the hottie gets together with this older gentlemen- which is creepy but there it is. And Werther is always hanging around the couple in a super cringe way to ‘win her back’ or some crap like that. 


**Sir William Patterson**: There is a little more to it than that Yolander...


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: Really? Where? Its insipid. He realises that the chicks Sugar Daddy? He’s ok. The girl he loves? She’s happy. So guess what? He decides it’s in everyone’s best interest to...kill himself. 


**Sir William Patterson**: Seriously, there is a lot more to it, it was part of the Strum und Drang poetic movement and...


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: What a TOTAL incel!  I mean Jebus! But guess what? Uber Incel can’t even kill himself right. He puts some old pistol to his head, pulls the trigger but doesn’t die. So lies there, like his brain’s bleeding out and it’s all woe is me and afterwards this girl and her Sugar Daddy are all sad...


**Sir William Patterson**: Honestly, it...


**Dr Li Huning**: There is a degree of accuracy here Sir William. 


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: Thank you Doc. Anyway there THEN follows this huge over the top reaction apparently. Young men all over fricken Europe read this book and start dressing as this character. Like a whole new fashion craze all based on this Werther Incel Guy. Let’s face it- Goethe invented fanboys!


**Sir William Patterson**: Goethe did NOT invent fanboys. 


**Dr Li Huning**: It could be argued that ‘Werther Fever’ was the first manifestation of what is today called ‘fangirl syndrome’ yes. 


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: ANYWAY- that’s what we had to work into our disaster flick. That! How the hell do we work in that?


**Meredith Walker**: But you all clearly did?


**Dr Li Huning**: We were able to harmonise the themes in the novel into conventions the Vorton’s could conceptualise. Human romanticism became Vorton desires for unity; connotations of desire were made into a longing to be re-connect as a species; crucially we showed the Vortons they were not weakened by this horrendous situation but retained agency. It was important they became invested in the story. 


**Meredith Walker**: Because of the Werther Fever Effect?


**Dr Li Huning**: Because of that, yes. 


**Meredith Walker**: Sir William, you insisted upon the story being used because you of this after effect. Did you hope somehow using the book by Goethe that the Vorton’s would change their minds about us. Sway our conquerors with a good story?


**Dr Li Huning**: The original made Napoleon a huge fan I have noticed. 


**Sir William Patterson**: Well not quite. Werther Fever erupted across Europe as translations of the novel came out, as Yolanda described, but there was an additional side effect to this. Across Europe there began a series of copycat suicides as these impressionable young men would emulate their hero...


**Meredith Walker**: So the book inspired suicide?


**Sir William Patterson**: Not quite. The link between the novel and the spate of suicides that erupted across Europe is still hotly debated within academic circles...


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: There was a fricken wave of 18th century Incel fanboys blowing their brains out after reading this book I swear!


**Sir William Patterson**: I felt that perhaps this effect could be replicated to a degree; given the complexity of Vorton psychology, I didn’t expect a simple replication of the impact upon 18th century readers but that was the gist of the plan. I simply weaponised our ability to tell stories. 


**Meredith Walker**: And Professor the hope within the liason committee was that this miniseries would cause some suicides amidst the Vorton race?


**Dr Li Huning**: No. Given they had once said we humans were but a millionth of them, we earnestly hoped for a much stronger reaction. And we all know the results. 


**Meredith Walker**: The entire Vorton species. 


**Dr Li Huning**: Every last one of them. We imagine it was a cascade effect. The climax of the series, the Vorton version of Werther discovering that the race had lost its telepathic abilities forever and that his furious determination to regain this skill was in fact holding back his species from evolving to maintain their position as dominant was crucial. They had to see him rationalise that he was hurting the species by his continued existence  


**Sir William Patterson**: The aim was to introduce the very human idea of noble sacrifice to the Vorton... you know ‘it’s a Far far better thing that I do now...’


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: BUT punch it home with a 28 hour lead up designed to get the entire race to identify with one fricken over-sensitive milkbaby. The results? Splat!

**Meredith Walker**: Splat?


**Dr Li Huning**: Quantum biological effect. Autopsies reveal the Vorton suffered cerebral implosions as we imagine a cascade effect of the desire to self destruct took over. 


**Meredith Walker**: They willed themselves to death?


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: Hey- you ever stood on the edge of a drop and gazed down and had that brief urge to just like jump!? Imagine that but that urge amplified by 23 billion people, your entire species thinking it at the exact same time and now imagine just how powerful that urge would become. Splat!

**Meredith Walker**: None of you seem bothered by the fact you annihilated an entire species?

**Yolanda Yaltzer**: They had wanted to wipe out the Orangutans. I’d take Orangutans over the aliens who screwed Canada any time. 

**Dr Li Huning**: Ultimately it was about survival. Either we destroyed them or we remained slaves. I have no issue with that. 

**Sir William Patterson**:  They were the enemy. And this was the only weapon we could use. We won. They lost. Its war. 


**Meredith Walker**: And Admiral you were able to take control of their ship instantly?


**Sir William Patterson**: We had spent 18 months carefully studying how they piloted their ships and in the weeks during the serialisation of the show I had familerised myself with the controls yes. 


**Meredith Walker**: Now there are some who feel that there was a degree of calculation in what came next...


**Sir William Patterson**: The entire Vorton Ascendency was gone. The species was no more. But the 13 subservient planets didn’t know we had just wiped them out. What followed was a strategic decision. 


**Dr Li Huning**: Presidents Lu of China, McKindrick of the United States, and Prime Ministers of Israel, Great Britain, Japan and Indonesia all agree upon us travelling to the Vorton homeworld and taking control of its resources. 


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: I am SO gonna turn that trip into a film...


**Dr Li Huning**: Miss Yaltzer, much of the operation and the aftermath is still classified...


**Yolanda Yaltzer**: Doc, PLEASE!  Like anyone needs accuracy to make a good movie... of course I’d need to make me and sailor boy have a romance to make it work...

**Sir William Patterson**: A romance Yolanda? Well I hardly think...

**Yolanda Yaltzer**: Hey sailor boy. Chill. Its a movie not real life. We both agreed on the way back to remain as sex buddies...


**Meredith Walker**: And coming up- the new Human Space Empire; one year on- are we ready to rule the galaxy? I’d like to thank my guests for their time...

Chapter 2- Room Service, and Pillow Talk

Sillisia Hotel Room # 803, inside the Shil’vati Security Sector (AKA The Green Zone) Kansas City, Missouri

Travis looked over the room service menu, and was considering the Denver omelet, and maybe the sourdough toast. The hotel Mel’Bae picked operated inside the heart of the Shi’vati sector but was still accessible to the rest of the Kansas City Metro Area. It was Thursday morning, he should have left by now, but he had stayed. Mel’bae lay next to him, her large form resting on her side sleeping soundly. 

Why was he still here?

When they had first checked into the room  at first he felt ashamed. Not for offering himself to a Shil’vati, he was truly curious about what sex with one of them, with her, would be like. But when he saw the room was larger than his one bedroom studio by almost 50 percent he knew she had to have shelled out more than one of his month’s paychecks on this place. He tried to apologize but she wouldn’t hear of it. 

“I’ve got eight months of back pay weighing my credit chit down,” she said. “I don’t mind spoiling my man.” It was a bit of a blow to his ego, her ‘spoiling’ him, but the way she said “ my man” felt curiously, well…

Heartwarming.

Turning back to Mel’Bae he saw that she had slipped out of her clothes exposing her naked body to him, Her large purple breasts were slightly damp with sweat and the dark blue, nearly indigo color of her nipples stood out in the light from the room. She then quickly removed the bun from her hair allowing the straight, thick, black hair to fall further than Travis had originally thought her hair was capable of being inside of the bun she wore it in.  It cascaded nearly to her lower back. Travis took the sight of her in. Then he removed his shirt and undid the buckle on his belt and took off his trousers. (He had changed out of his sparring clothes in the park bushes using clothes he had in his backpack while Mel’Bae had made reservations.) Next he stripped off his shirt, leaving only his boxers on. 

“Oh,” she said. “Already?!”

Travis didn’t get her meaning at first, then he looked down and saw that his erection had snuck its way past the front opening in his boxers, and was currently standing prouder than the flag Armstrong put on the moon. “I guess you have that effect on me.” He said as a grin appeared on his face.. 

She smiled and  pulled him to the bed in the middle of the room, larger than a king size, (Amazon size?) he thought absent mindedly as he kissed her mouth and fondled her breasts with his thumbs rubbing the dark blue of her nipples.

Her tongue shot into his mouth. It was large, long, somewhat rough and surprisingly sweet. They held this embrace for a while. Her small tusks, roughly where a human’s lower canines would be were comfortably on either side of his cheeks. She finally broke off the kiss and used her hands to yank down his boxers. Now they were both naked. He moved his head downward and began to lick and suck on her nipples. Mel’Bae began breathing heavily, he then brought his right hand down to her groin, caressing her labia before moving up to her clitoris. for some reason looking there his mind flashed on the word *blueberry*. Mel’bae was panting now, she grabbed Travis and laid him flat on his back on the bed alternating between kissing his mouth and rubbing her large breasts in his face while humping the side of his left leg, she then began to kiss his neck and then his chest and then lower.

“Wait..” Travis said as he got to his belly.

“Are you ok?” She asked a worried look on her face “Is...Is it my tusks?” she asked. 

The truth was that yes that was partly it. Studying Aikido he had learned a lot about human anatomy. Even though she was being cautious, having the chance that they would get carried away during felatio and one of her tusks could nick Scarpa’s triangle, the cross section of arteries and veins inside his legs. Causing him to bleed out in a matter of minutes was unsettling.

But he would never tell her that, so he told her a different truth, not a lie of omission but something that was also true that superseded worrying about her tusks.

“It’s just that, I’ve never felt comfortable with that.” he said “I mean sometimes it’s a part of foreplay, but sometimes with human women, well… They do it just to get you out the door.” 

“Really?” She said

“Yeah, like if they don’t like the date they will sometimes blow a guy just to keep him happy and then never go for a second date, I don’t know, It just has always felt as impersonal to me as a handjob, like I’m not good enough for the real thing for them. if they do it.”

“Oh,” she said. “Does that mean you aren’t interested in …”

“No!” Travis said emphatically. “No, I’m more than happy to do that if you like it, I mean I’m a guy, I’m going to cum no matter what, Hell, all I need is a stiff breeze and a smile sometimes to get me going. I….” He had never explained himself like this before. Something about crossing cultures and to be frankly, crossing alien species barriers had made him more honest than he had ever been in bed with a woman. “I just want to make sure you enjoy this as much as I’m sure I’m going to.”

Mel’Bae raised herself up to her full height, or as full as she could get while kneeling with her legs spread to either side of his naked body. Lifting her arms above her head and posing like a cross between an ancient warrior goddess and the type of pin-up girl WW2 bomber pilots painted on their planes, she giggled.

This Amazon actually giggled. “Well Missourian, SHOW ME!” as she flopped down next to him staring her black and gold eyes intently into his white and green ones.

So he did. After all, he didn’t have tusks.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

That was their first time, followed soon by their second, and their third.

Afterward it was about 3AM on Thursday they were both shagged out as the British would say. They decided to avail themselves of room service, not the kitchen, but they used the room’s built in tablet to order some drinks. It turns out Mel”Bae had acquired a taste for gin, in her time on Earth. 

So they sat and sipped from one of the two bottles of Bombay Sapphire she had ordered. Her drinking it straight in a tumbler and him pouring his shots into a water glass and mixing it with some sports drink he found in the mini fridge. If he was to regain his stamina he would need the electrolytes. 

And as they drank they talked, really talked for the first time he had met her in Sam’s BBQ. At first the talk was about what they had just been doing. She confessed that she had some misconceptions about humans, She had heard that they had stamina to go for hours, and when he had only lasted less than 45 minutes and most of that time was when he was going down on her, she assumed it was an exaggeration. You see a Shil’vati men are only capable of climaxing once a time and then they are spent for at least a day, so She had assumed his stamina was for one round. Imagine her surprise!

He confessed to her he also had some misconceptions, Because of her frame being over seven feet tall he had been worried about how well they would fit together. hence the long cunnlingus session The old joke about parking a bike in an airplane hanger had come to his mind. (not that he would EVER admit that to her!) So when she pulled his mouth off of her and guided him inside of her  he found out he was also in for a surprise. Her insides latched on to him, almost tugging him into her with a wet, soft and intensely warm feeling. They had then moved from missionary to holding each other in a kneeling upright position, to her on top in the course of their frantic sex. while she was on top arching her back and groaning softly he came, he came so hard he thought he might have actually busted a nut, honestly. 

And then, after a moment of respite. He started again.

And then again.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

They talked about more than just the mechanics of interstellar species coupling,  He found out that She had grown up on a farm, in a backwater little world called Kintril, wherever the hell that was, She had joined the Shil’vati Imperial Marines straight out of school looking for adventure. She and her squad were shuttle mechanics, keeping the large, transport craft stationed in the base flying. I was a rear echelon brother-fucker job, but had to be done. He also found out why she had eight months of back pay to “spoil” him. 

She had her squad had just been rotated out of a base  near one of the hottest Red Zones on Earth. Kansas City, in fact most of North America was pretty well pacified, minus the random lone nut or three. America had pretty much accepted their new position in the grand scheme of things and had gotten back to doing business and making money. That doesn’t mean they were happy about it though. But, Kansas City was paradise next to where she just came from.

She told him about being stuck at the base, only heavily armed patrols or special forces strike teams ever left to go out into the countryside. For her, That place was a never ending torrent of mind numbing boredom.

He told her she was fucking lucky.

“What!” Mel’bae responded to his words with a hurt look on her face. So Travis told her why she was lucky. He told her about his mother.

Decades back, That shithole she was stationed at was already a Red Zone, only it was the Big-Mean-Green-Machine that was fighting the people there. His Mom had done two tours of duty there and had come home minus her left foot and a classic case of PTSD. 

Talking about his mom was hard, even though she was better now. The neurological therapies the Shil’vati had brought had made her better. They made her his mom again, not him having his mom and then helping to hide his other mom. The one who woke up crying out for his father in the middle of the night. Who he would have to help get out of bed on really bad days and get her to wash because she hadn’t showered or changed her clothes for a while.  The woman who had been in the planning stages of committing suicide, trying to figure out how to do it and not have him be the one to find her body, before she had had a moment of clarity and sought help. 

“I’m so sorry Travis” She said as she put her gin glass down to nuzzle her cheek to his.

“It’s OK,” he said. She’s better now. your people helped her.

“Do you still live with her?” she asked. 

“No, she...Well she lives on a farm about 3 hours drive from here. It was my grandparents' place. She took over working it when they passed. I lived with them when she had to go to the hospital, and we both lived there when….” he cut himself off. This is NOT something he should be talking to her about!

“When what?” she asked right before the realization struck her “ OH! when we invaded. you had to evacuate because of us. Travis I’m sorry you had to go through all of that, I wasn’t involved in the war, I was still in school then.”

“I figured you were, we’re about the same age, and don’t worry that time is over now.” Christ he wanted to steer this line of questioning away from the invasion. As much as he liked Mel’Bae and was actually beginning to feel close to her after tonight, he knew he could never tell her about what happened during the final month of the invasion. 

He was resolute. He had only told one living person, his Sensei, about those three men in the van. And Sensei promised to take that knowledge to his grave for Travis.

He swallowed some more of his gin/aid cocktail. “So what are you doing tomorrow?” he asked

“Well the rest of my squad went out for drinks and to try and get laid, And the girls will probably want to do that again tomorrow. They’re staying in rooms up on the 12th floor. Trynell, she’s the tall one who came with me, is a little pissed at me I think cause she had to miss out on the bars. “And… “ she said coyly as she leaned her still nude body close to him. “Because I DID get lucky.” she whispered into his ear as she licked her long, rough tongue around his earlobe. 

*Damn*. Travis thought to himself after she did  that, his member already starting to rise again. He hadn’t gone all night like this since….since ever. Are they putting Viagra in the fucking sports drinks now or something?

“Travis, How? Goddess above! How are you even able to do THAT!” Mal’bae looked at him in shock seeing he had risen once again.

He didn’t know why he thought up what he was about to say, he knew The Shil’vati were  polygamous  and usually shared one man among eight women. but right now, she got a rise out of him so he thought he should get one out of her.

“It’s alright Mel’bae,” he looked earnestly into her eyes. “If you can’t again, I could always see if Trynell is still awake, after all she did miss out on the ba…”

“NO!” She almost yelped while suddenly wrapping her legs around his waist and using her weight to put him flat on his back, her large breasts almost smothering his face as her nipples perked up turning from that near indigo to an almost royal blue.

“Round four” he said, in a muffled chuckle.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

So here I am, Travis thought, as he lay there. Looking over to Mal’bae he pulled the bedsheet up over her waist to give here some modesty. He was laying nude still because the temperature of the room was too warm for him, it was kept at Shil’vati comfort levels.  He put down the menu, and went to the bathroom.

After using the toilet, he looked over and saw the shower and the tub. The shower stall was nothing fancy but the tub? It was a massive thing about the size of a large jacuzzi, or a medium sized public bath in Japan. It was already filled with water, he looked over and read the instructions on the card on the wall telling him how to turn it on and set the temperature. He pressed the settings on the control panel and saw the bathwater start to move. not bubbling, but more of a circulation system bringing in hot water and drawing out cold.  

Travis wasn’t sure what to do now. Should he shower and rinse off in the stall before getting in the tub? Or, just hop in. While not exactly “Death by SNU SNU!” last night left him feeling a bit sore. And a hot bath would feel perfect right now. He decided it was best to do the more hygienic approach, so he stepped into the shower stall, turned on the tap and began to soap up.

there was a knock on the bathroom door. “Travis, can I come in?”

“Oh, sure.”

“Thanks sorry but I need to use the shi…… Um what are you doing?” Mel’bae asked.

she was standing in the doorway nude with a curious look on her face.

“I...um… I wasn’t sure how you use the bath, so I thought it best to shower first so I don’t get the water dirty.

“Oh, that's ok,” she said waving her hand, “You don't need to do that the circulator filters out any soap or grime, Umm… sorry but I need the shitter, Can you please step out for a while, I like you but I don't think we really are THAT close yet. 

“Yeah, OK, me too.”

Travis stepped outside for a few minutes. “OK, you can come back in. He heard her say. When he came back in she was already in the tub. “Ohh, the water’s great, and…” she patted her hand on the side of the tub. “ I think we are THIS close.”

Travis agreed.

Cuddling in the tub with a Shil’vati was interesting, he was used to cuddling with women smaller than him so as he laid there with her in his arms, or more accurately he in hers they talked more. It was odd, not good or bad, just different.

They got out of the tub and then dressed. Finally ordering room service. while eating he showed her videos of Aikido explaining more about the art. She was impressed by the way the people in the videos moved wearing Aikido uniforms, a basic white jacket and a hakama, a pleated flowing trousers. “You move like water.” She said. “It’s almost like dancing, very sexy” kissing him.

Travis wasn’t sure how he felt about his art being called “sexy”. Aikido is a lot of things to him, self defense training, moving meditation, full of beautiful movements that have both subtlety and dynamic power. The last thing he would call it is sexy.

As he pondered this Mel’Bae’s omni-pad received a message. Her squad mates were at the hotel pool and wanted her to join them. So she asked Travis nervously if he would like to join them too.

He guessed her nervousness is because he had only agreed to one night and it was almost the afternoon of the next day. If he wanted he could slip out and go home with nobody the wiser that he had been with her. He could say his goodbyes and leave, just slip out through the lobby doors and no one would have to know..

Instead he went to the lobby’s gift shop and bought some toiletries, and a swimsuit.

I have started on the Intro 110 chapter, it's not much but it's not dead. Still working on this as a collaboration with u/lucasAK2004 , he'll be posting chapter 4 a few minutes after me. A lot of time was spent, perhaps too much, into the finer details of things like, actual scientific reasoning for how things could perhaps work, the physics behind them and other details like military hiercharchy and equipment ect.. Essentially, bunch of nerds nerding about their lore and world, which def slowed things down.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

What started off as a beautiful day to spend playing video games quickly transformed into the stuff of nightmares. Mysterious and sudden deployments on a need to know basis did not inspire much confidence in having a good day reckoned Patrick.

Thankfully, he'd managed to grab a little bit of information out of the pilots before they left, a well placed cigarette here and there certainly helped and he at least knew they were going to the North West Territories.

In contrast, Alberta was looking mighty fine compared to some hole in the frozen ground 2,000 kilometers up north. He still remembered mere hours ago when the First Sergeant came to him as he was about to go on leave. The timing of it was impeccable, and when he mentioned deployment, there was nothing more he could do. He hated having to break bad news to his squad members, but it had to be done and he had gone to give it to them straight. Minutes later, they were on board a plane and headed out.

They all sat in the back of the plane, a c-17 Boeing Globemaster, talking about the deployment while two other platoons chatted among themselves. Patrick looked over his squad, seated next to him was Tanner. A good guy, hard worker but a former pothead from Toronto. David, in front of him, was from Alberta and a good old redneck. A great hunter too, he was the best shot in the squad. On the opposite side, Martin. From Montreal, a quiet and usually calm person, most didn't want to tangle with the big black guy but he was really nice.

“Man, the North West Territories, really? What are we even going to do there? There’s nothing!” From Tanner’s tone of voice, it was clear he was disappointed with their deployment location.

“Could be a joint operation with the Americans, Alaska has a few bases as well.” Martin chimed in.

“With this many people? I doubt it. Fuck, with everything that’s been happening this year, it has to be aliens.” David replied, with a hint of sarcasm in his voice.

“We’re not even there yet and I already miss Alberta. Things I’d never thought I’d say for 400$, Alex.” Tanner was now looking down at the floor, feeling dejected.

“Well, whatever it is, it’s important.” Patrick stepped in, trying to keep morale up. “They were sending everybody up, this is the third plane.”

The flight lasted a few more hours and they chatted a bit more about irrelevant topics before deciding to try and get some rest since they weren’t sure what awaited them there. One of the first things they were taught was the ability to sleep anywhere, which certainly helps when you’re in the armed forces. The plane’s powerful engine’s roar was hard to ignore but with enough training, anything was possible.

Patrick awoke from a jolt of the plane, the landing wheels hitting the ground and giving it a small bump. They all exited in an orderly fashion, finding themselves in a small airfield in the middle of nowhere. After everyone disembarked, the Boeing took off, leaving the company of soldiers alone on the ground.

“Transport’s ETA is 25 minutes!” Yelled the Master Sergeant.

“Fuck, we gotta wait here in this cold?” complained Tanner.

“Just keep moving, you’ll be good.” Replied Patrick, running in place himself.

“Bah, this is barely chilly.” David lit up a cigarette, looking around at the other squads.

The 25 minutes flew by and turned into 35 minutes until they saw another Globemaster in the sky. They stood to the side of the runway, if it even deserved to be called that, and watched as five Navistars were unloaded. They boarded up, 20 in each vehicle, along with some equipment, and headed out on the road.

A 2 hour ride later after leaving the small town their airport was based in, the Navistars stopped, letting the soldiers off before going to unload their additional cargo at the nearest provisions stockpile. A small temporary base was already set up, uniformed American marines going about their work.

“Oh man, I told you we’d be working with the Americans.” Martin said proudly.

Whatever free time they thought they had was cut short as the Master Sergeant began yelling. “Alright! Into the main command tent, let’s go!”

They began following the other soldiers, all lining up to enter the double flaps of the main tent, an apparent very temporary construction for a location like this.

Standing up on a wooden crate, an obvious officer looked at the crowd of soldiers pouring in and waited until all were inside before he began talking.

“At ease soldiers, I’m your battalion commander; Lieutenant Colonel Hessner. For the sake of brevity, you all now possess level 3 top secret clearance. If word of what you hear today ever \*gets out of this goddamn base, a court martial will be the LEAST of your worries. Now this is the third time I have made this briefing today and I’ll still have to do it a few more times, so keep your mouths shut and your eyes up front.”

You could have dropped a dime on the floor and heard, it was so quiet in the room. Everyone was granted top secret clearance? What kind of madness was this? It meant that whatever was going to come out of the Lt. Col’s mouth was so secret in nature that only a handful of people were allowed to know but somehow, now, they needed a whole regiment to know? Nothing good could come of this.

The battalion commander began his speech, “53 hours ago, American civilians brought this image to a news network.” The Lt.Col shows the image of a Da’kar on a projector. “No, this is not fake. We checked. Thankfully, we were able to avoid a spill to the media as the CEO of said media company decided to contact us first. 29 hours ago, these aerial pictures were taken.” Pictures show strange buildings in a tundra environment. “That settlement is of an unknown origin and located in the NorthWest Territories, near the Alaskan border. The Canadian and American governments have decided to cooperate on this. This base will be jointly shared with our American counterparts.”

There was a brief pause as he drank water. “I'm sure many of you are wondering why we need hundreds of boots up here, well we’re going to establish a perimeter. Whatever these things are, we cannot permit them to simply spread out. No, we don’t know where they came from or how they got there, this is still being investigated. Now, I’ll let your commanding officers give you your specific orders, you’re dismissed.”

Not even after getting 20 feet outside of the command tent, a lieutenant intercepted Patrick’s squad. “Hey, got your orders here. We’re establishing a perimeter and we need boots to patrol this perimeter. You guys are lucky enough to be on first patrol.” He handed them a map of the local area, their path marked by a red pen. Patrick saluted after receiving the orders and waited for him to walk away before he turned to his squad.

“Even after all the stuff we just learned, I suppose it’s comforting to know that lieutenants are still assholes.”

Tanner walked up to Patrick and looked at the map the lieutenant gave him. “Are we getting close enough to see them?”

“No it doesn’t look like it.” Tanner’s excitement dimmed a little and he gave out a disappointed sigh. “Perk up, from the looks of it we’ll be able to see the compound in the distance for most of the route.” Patrick flipped through the pages for a few moments before folding them up and \*stuffing them into a pocket on his vest. “We should get a move on, we can figure out our barracks arrangement when we get back.”

After grabbing their equipment from their bags, they placed them on the side of one of the large tents and started to check their gear. “Helmet, gun, vest, gloves, backpack, map. I’m all good, how about the rest of you?” Patrick looked over to his squadmates, each of them giving a thumbs up verifying that everything was in order. “Good, let’s move out. David, take point!”

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cold, wet, and windy, a shitty day turned worse with a surprise deployment to the middle of nowhere. Campos thought that once they got there a base would already be set up but he was pleasantly surprised to see that in fact they had to set it up. Nothing better than backbreaking work after deploying without warning to an undisclosed location. It was only after all the grueling work that they were actually briefed as to what they were doing there.

Teer fell back into his rack, his hands covering his face. “Aliens, of course it’s fucking aliens. Why would it be anything else?”

Burdine sat in the rack next to him while snacking on a protein bar. “I thought they looked pretty cool from the pictures.”

As annoying as they were at times, they were some of the best marines Campos knew. That’s not to say that he didn’t enjoy breaking the news to them that they would be on patrol early tomorrow morning. But for now they had the rest of the day to themselves as a reward for helping set up. “$50 says Burdine is gonna get mauled while trying to fuck one of them.”

Teer gave a chuckle, “Come on, no one would take that bet, it’s a matter of when, not if.”

Their conversation was interrupted by the tent being opened and a voice asking, “Is this barracks tent B?” Campos turned to see four canadian soldiers standing at the door looking particularly lost. They were in fact in barracks tent B, but it was obvious that they were looking for the Canadian one.

“Wrong tent B, the Canadian one is just behind this one, a row down.”

The one in front gave a smile, “Thanks.”

The four of them turned around. But before leaving, one of them turned around, “Nice meeting you, uh…”

“Campos, Sergeant Campos.”

“Ah Sergeant Campos, I’m Sergeant Patrick. Oh and sorry about bothering you.”

“Nice meeting you too, Patrick, and don’t worry about it. See you around.”

Campos sat on his rack before lying down in an effort to get some sleep when the tent opened again. He sighed as he looked over to see Harrison walking in holding a radio and wearing a massive smile, “Guess what I bought off of one of the officers.”

“Keep the volume down, I want to get some sleep and the other squad will be back at any minute.” Campos rolled over and slowly drifted off to the sound of the radio. Morning came quickly. Perhaps quicker than campos would've liked, but he had a job to do. Burdine however, didn’t see it that way and needed a little extra motivation. Thankfully an inverted rack was enough to get him up.

The morning sun hung just above the horizon, painting the landscape and sky with an orange hue. The frosty tundra squished under their feet as they walked along their route. It wasn’t ten minutes into their patrol when Campos felt something cold hit his nose. He looked up but didn’t see anything. Holding out his hand a snowflake landed on it before quickly melting into nothingness.

The snow steadily picked up as they went, quickly covering the ground in a thin layer of white. It wouldn’t stay though, the snow would eventually disappear as the sun rises. Campos closed his eyes for a moment taking a deep breath and listening to the soft howl of the wind.\* The air was harsh and cold chilling him to the core.

“Man, why can’t we just bomb the hell out of them instead of patrolling around all day, it would be way cheaper and easier.”

“Because Harrison, bombing everything out of existence isn’t always the solution, and the higher ups really enjoy watching enlisted walk all day.”

“I should’ve gone to college but no, know I’m in the middle of nowhere freezing my ass off.”

After their ramblings subsided, the squad stood atop a hill staring at the alien compound in the distance. It seemed strangely surreal to see it in person, actual buildings constructed by intelligent beings other than humans. Where had they come from, why of all places did they decide to set up here? With a count of 24 permanent buildings they must’ve had something planned.

The squad leader took out his binoculars and peered into them to get a better look of the alien compound. He could just make out figures digging a redoubt around the compound and others were setting up what appeared to be some kind of static defenses. Their fortifications were lackluster at best, but if they were fortifying that means they at least knew something was up.

“Alright that’s enough standing around, let's get going.”

The snowfall only worsened as time went on obscuring their vision to the point they had trouble seeing a few hundred yards in front of them. It wasn’t long until they began to crest another hill, only a few more before they could head back and rest. Their patrol would be monotone if it weren't for the fact that there was a very real chance that they could get into a firefight with aliens; it was tiring though, their feet sunk into the tundra with each step making it a chore to even walk. When they neared the top, the everlasting sound of the wind was undermined by Teer shouting.

“Shit, contacts on our right, 50 yards!”

Instinctively, Campos dropped to a prone position and readied his gun along with the rest of his squad. He turned to meet the threat, four figures approaching them at a slow walk. Peering into his sights he aimed at the figures immediately recognizing their camouflage uniforms. With a sigh he slowly rose to his feet.

“Stand down, it’s the fucking CA.”

“The fuck they doing sneaking up on us like that? We should smoke them.”

“Don’t waste your ammo.”

Campos brushed snow from the front of his uniform before waving over the Canadians. One of them returned a similar gesture as they continued forward. When they got closer, something about them seemed oddly familiar, but he just couldn’t put his finger on it. It took a few more moments for him to realize that it was coincidentally the squad that had accidentally walked into their tent the night before. The Canadians didn’t seem to recognize them at first either, that was until they were just a few feet away.

“Campos was it? Funny running into you.”

“That was quite the spook you gave us, not that it needs to be said but that could’ve gone way worse than it did.”

“Well I’m glad it didn’t. I would’ve hated to report back that me and my squad had killed a squad of marines.”

“Not in your wildest dreams. On a more serious note, it would’ve been nice to at least know that we would be crossing paths with other squads, unless someone fucked up and we weren’t supposed to cross in the first place.”

Campos thought for a moment before reaching into his pocket and pulling out a map and opening it.“I’m curious about something, could I see your map with your patrol route on it?”“Uhh, sure.”

The Canadian squad leader slipped his map out of his vest pocket and unfolded it. Campos moved to Patrick’s side to compare their maps. What he saw he almost couldn’t believe, the maps were of completely different areas. The pure incompetence and stupidity required to lead to something like this was infuriating to him. Campos closed his map and put it in his pocket, someone was going to hear about this.

Just as he was about to turn to his squad something caught the corner of his eye, a tall figure wearing a grey uniform not unsimilar to something from world war one, cautiously approaching them. When it saw Campos looking It stopped and stared back at him with its reptile-like eyes. The alien’s clawed hands were wrapped around a brass gun of some sort that connected to something on its back via hoses. It took a moment before his senses snapped back to him and he raised his gun.

“Are you guys not paying attention? There’s a fucking contact sneaking up on us!”

Shuffling and series of curses could be heard as both squads fumbled to point their weapons at the intruder. The gesture of hostility caused the alien to become obviously uneasy as it took a step back. Before it could retreat any further a hand forcibly pushed down Campos’ barrel. He looked over to see that it was the canadian squad leader’s hand that had shoved his gun off target.

“Hold on, I have an idea.”

“We aren’t supposed to have any ideas.”

“Just trust me on this.”

Patrick shuffled through his pockets leaving Campos quite perplexed. His plan was soon unveiled when he pulled out a bag of beef jerky.

“You have got to be kidding me.”",/r/HFY/comments/kxf6zk/operation_snow_eagle_chapter_3/,22

Chapter 3- Date Night

The lobby’s shop was a bit of a disappointment. First of all, even though they had no sales tax, they charged a five percent surcharge for using cash instead of charging it to the room. *Somehow that had to be illegal, right?* Travis had no intention to charge it to the room, Mel’Bae had paid enough for this place already, he was not going to take advantage of that. Secondly, the swimsuit he picked out wasn’t something he would normally wear. It was a pair of board shorts that were black with some kind of orange floral print design. *What was this supposed to be? Travis thought. Were they palm trees, marijuana leaves, or some kind alien plant life he had never seen?* Travis had picked them out because the other men’s swimwear was not to his taste, they started at speedos, and got more revealing from there.

Travis bought some sunscreen and a razor along with the shorts before returning to the room. Mel’Bae had already left sending him a message that she was already at the pool. Travis stripped and put on the shorts, using the razor he shaved his face and then put on his T-shirt from his sparring match. *Damn* he thought to himself *I only have two sets of clothes here* he will have to go home and change if he was going to stay over tomorrow.

If.

*Deal with that later*, he thought as he checked his messages to make sure none of the bars he freelanced working at wanted him on shift tonight. He had cleared his schedule beforehand, but sometimes they would call up if they needed extra help. His usual hours were Sunday to Wednesday. No messages so he  grabbed the sunscreen and a towel to head down to the pool. looking in the mirror he thought to himself. *Ugly board shorts and a T-shirt, all I need is a sideways facing ballcap and red Solo cup and I could cosplay as a frat boy.*

Travis made it down to the pool. The place was decked out in that purple alloy the Shil’vati used. The pool was a large oval with one end of the pool having tiers of  deck chairs arranged in rows raising up like movie theater seating and a small alcove with a bar and stools set up. 

There were five Shil’vati standing near the deck chairs; the first one he saw clearly was Trynell, the taller than average one. Then he spotted Mel’bae, her hair done back up in a bun, her swimsuit was what looked like a black pair of biker’s shorts and a grey top. In fact they all were wearing very similar swimsuits. Maybe they were standard issue Travis guessed. He didn’t see the Raikiri member of her squad, *she must be making her own fun* he thought. For a fleeting second he thought he should check the local data net for any reports of missing children, but then he shut that thought down. They might give him the creeps but there was no reason to think the worst about them.

“Oh, here he is!” Mel’Bae said walking over and taking Travis’ arm. “Let me introduce you.” She walked with him over to her group. “Ladies, this is Travis.” 

“”She’s been bragging about you for the last fifteen minutes.” said Trynell “Now, all the rest of you get to meet the human who beat up the Sarge, then dragged her off to his bed by her hair.” chuckling as she said so.

“Trynell!” Said Mel’Bae

“It wasn’t really like that.” Travis said. “It was just a sparring match. Mel’Bae is a great sport for helping me out.” Mel’Bae squeezed his arm a little tight. best not to talk about what happened after. “So you ladies are all in the same unit?”

“Yeah, I’m Brem.” Said a woman with pink and green strands braided into her black hair. “And this is, Ko’ar and Lijung.” She pointed out the two other women. Ko’ar had silverish hair, cut into a cross between a pixie cut but with long bangs like the dreaded Karen, though she seemed amiable. Lijung’s hair was also silver, worn in a short braided ponytail.

Greetings were exchanged and they started to chat talking about what they did last night and where they went. Travis told them about working in some of those very bars as security.

“So, why didn’t you ever approach any of the girls there for this thing of yours?” asked Lijung.

“Umm… sorry?”

“That sparring thing of yours, you never asked any of the girls at the bars out?”

“Oh no,” said Travis. “When I’m working I won’t hit on patrons, it’s not professional, and doing so has led to a lot of bad situations in my experience, not my personal experience mind you, but just what I have observed,” he added.  “Where customers act entitled to more because they think they have an in with the bouncer.” 

“Oh” said Lijung “too bad”

“So, are you girls going swimming? Or are you just here to be lounging by the pool.” Travis said, trying to change the subject.

“Well I think we’ll just hang around here for a bit.” Mel’bae said. They quickly “Oh, but you don’t have to if you don’t want Travis It’s up to you.” She for some reason had a bit of a nervous look on her face. 

“Well,” Travis said ”I’m, pretty much up for anything. I’ve got no plans” Travis sat on one of the lounge chairs and took off his shirt. Opening the bottle on sunscreen he rubbed some first on his hands and then his arms, chest, shoulders and the back of his neck. He was suddenly aware that everyone was staring at him. “Oh do you girls need some?”

“Some…….” said Lijung 

“Sunscreen, I don’t know about Shil’vati but If I’m out in the sun too long my skin turns red and I get what we call sunburnt this stuff helps that from happening. Umm are you all ok?” They were still staring at him Mel’Bae’s mouth was hanging open a little and one of the other girls, Ko’ar, was definitely trying to look somewhere else or more accurately anywhere else. What the hell was the matter?

“Hey there cowboy!” Came a voice from the bar as the bartender stepped out from behind his taps and walked over. “Sorry there honey, but the hotel here doesn't allow…..Travis?”

Travis looked at the Bartender in recognition. “Hi Chris, How’ve you been?

Christopher Van Dorn was a Tall, lanky Dutchman Travis had worked with at one of the bars about a year back. The place was owned by a mean old queen named Tomas who they found out was stealing their wages by messing with the timesheets to make it look like they worked less than they had. When the staff complained, he threw a hissy fit and claimed they were all ungrateful little bitches and if they didn’t like it he would have them deported. Travis was born In Kansas City so that threat meant nothing to him. Chris, and the other bartender Eben also the other bouncer Cho, all had Shil’vati work cards. Which allowed them to work anywhere on the planet. Who was this guy kidding?

Justice was meted out that night. Travis and Cho had waited till the little pipsqueak went to his office and shut the door. Then they ran up and tacked two pieces of one inch plywood over the door frame and secured it with nail guns. It wasn’t completely impenetrable, in fact someone could break their way through in about an hour, or forty-five minutes if they were really desperate. With Tomas secured they went outside to where Chris and Eben, had piled all of the bottles of booze on the bar. they then told the patrons that they all have quit and that everyone should help themselves as they walked out to stunned crowd of gay men who quickly realized that free booze was for the having.

Good times, man.

“Travis, what are you doing here my friend?” He said with surprise showing on his face.

“Oh, umm…” *Well fuck*, Travis thought he might as well just come out with it already! “I’m here on a date, with Sargent Mel’Bae here.” he quickly added he didn’t want him to think he was banging the whole squad or something. “Mel’Bae, this is Chris, a friend I used to work with.” 

Mel’Bae didn’t really notice the bartender, but was staring at Travis, what was going on?

“Shit man you gotta put a shirt on!” Said Chris. 

“What?”

“It’s kinda like when you repressed Americans go to the beach in Europe and see topless girls, only you’re the one who’s got his body on display!”

“Oh,” quickly followed by the realization of  “OH, SHIT!” as he went to grab his T-shirt and pull it back on. “Sorry about that,”

“Travis…” said Mel’Bae

“Sorry I didn’t know, I mean, well we’ve been…”

“Yes I know!” She said emphatically, her face still blushing a little blue. Most of her squad had returned to normal, and had started laughing.

“Well,” said Chris. “If you ladies have enjoyed the show,” looking over at Travis, *fuck you too buddy* Travis thought “How about we go over to the bar and I’ll get you ladies some drinks”

What happened next  was several rounds of something called Blue-Grails, Where Travis and Chris got to catch up on old times,  and the girls took turns drinking at the bar and playing around in the pool. They also got some lessons in Human nature.

“Um no, We don’t actually bleed out our nose when we umm.. get, you know aroused.” Travis told Ko’ar 

“Really? All of those shows for children that I’ve seen show that, You know, the ones where the young man starts a family with wives he meets over the course of the show.” It occurred to Travis that for a polygamous race like the Shil’vati, They would consider Harem Anime to be a kids show.

“Well no, that’s more of a euphemism, for blood to flow to...somewhere else” Travis said. Mel’bae was hanging on his arm, a drink in her hand and occasionally nuzzling his cheek. *I hope she doesn’t get too drunk off this stuff* Travis thought. *Or else we would end up just crashing in the room.*

“Oh,” Ko’ar said  it took her a moment to realize. ”OOOHHH, I get it, yeah you probably shouldn’t show that to kids.”

“So what are you all doing tonight?”asked Chris, playing the helpful bartender. Trynell, Brem, and Lijung were rather fascinated with Chris; he was a few inches taller than Travis but skinnier, and was wearing a white tank top with the hotel’s name across his chest and a pair of cutoff jean shorts. *Sorry ladies*, Travis thought to himself, *but you are really sniffing up the wrong tree there.*

“Well,” said Brem as she look to her other sex starved squad mates. “Most of us already went out into the city last night.” She glanced over at Travis and Mel’Bae. “But we were thinking of trying something else. Have you ever been to Saucy Betty?” She asked.

Kansas City is, at its heart, a river town. And river towns have always had a wild side. Saucy Betty is one of those grey area places that the police look the other way out of apathy and convenience. In essence it’s a multi gender cabaret show and host/hostess club. Basically, people perform acts on stage and then they go out into the crowd to meet the patrons; if someone wants to buy them a drink they sit with them and try to get them to buy more. What happens after that is up to the performer and the patron. It’s not exactly a brothel, people can go there just to watch the shows but Branson it ain’t.

Travis had never bounced there, but Chris had tended bar there before. He made a call to his friend that still worked there and got them a table for six, Chris wasn’t going to go but did this to be helpful. They had a reservation at eight o’clock, three hours from now. So the group decided to break up and get dressed up. *Shit*, Travis thought *I still only have my clothes from Wednesday night*. But he had barely worn them, he thought with a smile, so they should be OK. 

They said their goodbyes, but Travis and Mel’Bae stayed back for a minute because Travis wanted to talk to Chris for a moment. “Hey Chris...Ummm”

“Don’t worry Travis, I get it. I never outed anyone before so I’m not going to start it now. Besides, these ladies tip really well, so I’m not going to piss anyone off.” he leaned in close and asked in English. “But I gotta know, What’s it like, you know, drinking the purple KoolAid?” 

Wow that expression sure had changed. “To be honest Chris” Said Travis also to Chris in English. “It’s great, though the KoolAid isn’t purple” he looked over at Mel’bae who was finishing her drink “It’s blue.”

“EWW” said Chris.

“Dude, you once told me how your boyfriend’s spunk tasted different after he became a vegan. You got no right to get prudish on me now, my friend. By the way, how is Jeremy?”

“That little twink left me for some vegan chick I caught him banging.” Chris said a little morosely.

“Oh damn, I’m sorry man, I didn’t know he was Bi”

“Neither did I, the bitch was just a friend he claimed, but they connected over their ‘Lifestyle’ and she kept hanging around all the time, She was always on me about not being vegan like them, how it was not the right choice for me and him to be not ‘dietary equals’ then I caught them in our bed. I swear those vegans are a fucking cult!”

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

They went back to their room and got dressed up to go out. He tried playing a little grabass with her but Mel’Bae seemed like she wasn’t interested in fooling around right now. *Was she still upset about him taking his shirt off at the pool? Damnit! How was he supposed to know!* Travis thought to himself.

Mel’Bae was dressed up with a shiny, almost liquidly silver top and a short black skirt. She looked positively stunning, Travis told her so and she seemed to warm to him being a little more flirty with her. “Wait for later, Travis, we’ll still have plenty of time tonight. Besides I need a break or I might not be able to walk later.” Travis didn’t know if she was humoring him, but after last night he was sure she hadn’t experienced anything like that before. Because HE sure hadn’t either.

They rode the elevator down to the lobby and stepped out. Her in her sexy outfit and him in his slightly wrinkled black polo shirt, bearing the name and emblem of his dojo, and his tan slacks. He wished he had at least could have Ironed them. They returned their keycards to the front desk and Travis received back his Shil’vati ID and work card which acted as his pass into the Shil’vati area of town. You could get a temporary pass for almost any reason, but getting the work card allowed him easy access whenever he wanted without having to apply every time so when he moved from bar to bar working different nights it really cut down on the travel time. He still wondered why he had to turn them over at the hotel as Mel’Bae’s plus one. Couldn’t they just make a photocopy for their records?

They waited downstairs, Mel’Bae looked like she wanted to talk about something but before they could the other members of her squad had come down, all dressed up. The hotel had a concierge shuttle bus service and apparently Saucy Betty was on their normal route. They waited for its arrival, chatting for a bit, Travis still had an uneasy feeling that Mel’Bae wanted to tell him something, but he didn’t know what. The shuttle bus arrived and off they went.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Saucy Betty was a two story building with a false front for a third story. On that false front was the electrified visage of the patron saint of Saucy Betty, the great Bettie Page. Why’d they spelled it Betty instead of Bettie? Travis had no idea, but he guessed lawyers were involved somehow.

Inside Betty’s had a forward facing stage with tables set up in semi-circles radiating out away from the stage like ripples in a pond after a rock was thrown in. At the back was a large semicircle bar and to the left of the bar near the door, a set of stairs leading up to the balcony.

Travis, Mel’Bae and her squad were escorted to their table by someone who was either a trans woman or a man in drag, Travis wasn’t sure, either way they were the group’s server, and their name was Linda. Because of their size, the squad and him had to have two tables put together. Linda went and took their drink orders. Travis looked around the room and spotted one or two other Shil’vati in the crowd but it was mostly human.

“What’s this?” Ko’ar asked Travis, pointing to the program that they were given. On the list of performers they had first a Polynesian fire dance team. Next was a Cirque du Soleil style acrobatic troupe, who apparently performed in the nude. and after that were some singing or more than likely lip syncing acts, followed by the one Ko’ar was pointing at. Madam Zarratina’s Reading Room.

So Travis tried to explain.

“So..It’s a man, who dresses as a woman? And then insults the people in the audience?” Ko’ar asked incredulously. 

“Well yes, I’ve seen The act before, when I worked security, so I know that outside of the club he identifies as a man, Sometimes this type of act is a trans woman, that’s someone who is born with male sex characteristics, but who believes themselves to be female on sometimes neither male or female.” Travis said.

“That’s really confusing,” Said Brem.

“Yeah, it is.” admitted Travis. “And, I’m sure someone here would say my explanation is wrong or not adequate enough, but it’s the best way I know how to explain it.

“OK,” said Trynell. “But why do they go out and insult the audience? Aren’t they afraid that someone will start a fight?”

“No, not really, you see. Madame Zarratina insults everybody including him..herself” Travis stumbled over his words. “The whole point is so that people can laugh at themselves without someones’ feelings getting hurt.”

The lights dimmed and the show started.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The fire dancers were very impressive and the ladies were completely shocked by the circus act. The singers and lip syncers  were of various degrees. The best was a Queen tribute act that recreated the 1985 LiveAid concert performance, but the man portraying Freddy Mercury added a new element. He was able to do a quick-change into some of Freddy’s iconic outfits during the songs. The ladies sat there mesmerized, even more so than the nude acrobats. *Glad to see that indeed Queen did have universal appeal*, Travis thought.

Then came Madame Zarratina, wearing an over the top blond wig and an outfit that looked like a 1920’s Medium had been smashed in the face by a 1960’s tie dyed commune (her words). She went around riffing with the audience then she stopped.

“OOOOHHH What do we have here, Looks like a date night!” singling out their table. What’s your name honey?” 

It took Travis a moment to think who in the group she was talking to, but obviously it was him. “I’m Travis,” he finally said.

“So, you with one special lady tonight? Or all of them?”

“Uh” Travis froze for a moment.

“Blink twice if you’re being held hostage sweetie” She said to a big laugh. 

“I’m with her,” he said holding Mel’Bae’s hand

“OH, That’s so sweet, What’s your name big girl?”

“Mel’Bae,” she said flatly.

“Look, I think this is great,” The crowd began to murmur. “No...I do! I really do. My uncle was a Rabbi, and he said to me ‘The flower of love, that can grow in the rockiest and most treacherous soil is the most beautiful.’ What does that mean? How the fuck do I know, he was also a drunk.” the crowd laughed. “You know how much of a bad drunk he was? He’s the rabbi that did my circumcision!” Big laugh again from the crowd “But you two, you two come from different worlds and yet, love blossoms and I think that’s beautiful, I really do. Everybody give Travis and Mel’Bae a hand!” The crowd began to cheer. “And… if Travis plays his cards right tonight, somebody please! Get this poor boy a wheelchair!”

BA DUM TISS

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Several hours later they were back in the hotel lobby. After the show they had actually gotten  Madame Zarratina’s autograph on a photo as a gift. Trynell and Ko’ar had come back to the hotel with one of the acrobats, whether they had talked him into coming with them or he was being “compensated” was none of Travis’ concern. What was his concern was Lijung.

On the shuttle ride home, she had been dropping subtle, and then not so subtle hints about trying to join him and Mel’Bae tonight. Things finally came to a head in the lobby where Mel’Bae had made it plain she was not sharing the room. (Or him tonight.) Travis seconded that decision very quickly. Finally Brem dragged the very inebriated Lijung off to the elevators.  

Travis and Mel’Bae went to the desk and got their key cards to the room Travis having to again drop his IDs off with the front desk. Then they went and got into the elevator. At which point Mel’Bae finally broke her silence and told him what she wanted to say in the lobby earlier.

“Travis I’m sorry, I’m not usually like this!”

“like what?”

“Look, Lijung is a good friend, but she’s married, She’s separated and going through a divorce but she’s still married. I can understand her having a fling but just……..”

“Just not with me.”

“Down at the pool I was telling them about how great last night was, bragging about you. Brem and Lijung started joking about maybe I should let them have a turn since... Well you know, you can go for hours.”

“And then, I show up and strip off my shirt, giving them a show.” Travis finished her thought.

“Goddess! I sound like some entitled fucking cunt noblewoman, trying to keep her husband at home and not let him…” Travis leaned in and kissed her. The elevator door opened and he led her out into the hallway.

“Mel’Bae, look I have no idea what I’m doing here, but I definitely don’t want to take Lijung to bed with me. Maybe It’s the fact that for most of humanity the default is serial monogamy, or at least that’s how most of us are raised to believe. But, I like you, a lot. A whole lot, and until we can figure out what the next step is, together, I don’t want to be with anyone but you.”

They kissed some more in the hallway then Mel’Bae led him down the hall to their room hand in hand. she fumbled a bit with the key card and almost dropped the signed picture of Madame Zarratina. They got the door open finally and began to strip each other of their clothes. 

Topless, Mel’Bae held up the signed photograph and asked Travis “Hey what does this mean?”

Travis looked at the autograph and read.

*To Travis and Mel’bae*

*May a beautiful flower grow.*  

 \-*Madame Zarratina*

*PS.*

*GIRL! GET YOU SOME!*

19,l0ce6b,HFY,Tue Jan 19 06:41:36 2021,Galactic Economics 1: Happy Existence,"*This is not a story filled with a lot of violent action and badass human mercenaries kicking alien ass. Instead, it's about markets, logistics, and economics. If that bores you, I totally understand.*

*Economics is a highly contentious field, but I've tried to keep current politics out of it. Most of the parts about human markets and history are descriptive, not judgemental.*

*Because there are some parts about human history or reflecting it, it was inevitable there may be a little bit of HWTF in there. My goal in describing those was not to glorify the worst parts of our own history, but to bring a realistic view of how we have learned from our past.*

*Spoiler that will give away parts of the first two chapters of the story:*

&gt;!I brainstormed what would happen if aliens only had barter economies but had millions of years of development without it anyway. It's hard to imagine such a system, because historians generally agree that human society never had a true economy based only on bartering. In the story, this was first represented by a lack of money, which is not unprecedented in our own history, but even our highly controversial history of centrally planned economies had ration vouchers or some other medium that represented value.!&lt;

*And chapter three spoilers:*

&gt;!As the story will start to reveal, such economies have serious limitations, and what started out seeming like a prosperous galactic community turns out to be not so much. This is not a rigorous critique of barter economies, just something I wrote up for fun when trying to imagine how one may or as it turns our may not work.!&lt;

*I've had to split the first couple chapters because they were hitting the reddit limit. Anyway, without further ado:*

---

In a word, they were almost... unremarkable.

They didn't come in military ships with big guns, intent on xenocide, slavery, or even conquest for Earth's resources. Much to the chagrin of the survivalists hiding out in the woods with their canned food and their hunting rifles. They just wanted to introduce themselves to the newcomer in the galactic neighborhood, so to speak, and establish standards for communications and trading.

As it turned out, aliens were relatively similar to humans. Sure they looked different, but the way they thought and lived, not so different after all. Billions of years of evolution tends to do away with the crazies, in a thousand different civilizations on a thousand different worlds. If you were to believe the froghead representatives, most fanatic species don't make it long enough to discover FTL.

After all, nuclear physics is a prerequisite to its invention... and to the galaxy, a genocidal civilization was a problem that solves itself.

So the aliens just showed up, faxed over the dimensions for landing pads for Galactic Standard ships, and then see you in a couple months. If they were amused by the residents of Earth's explosive reaction to their introduction, they didn't show it. As their ship blinked away, humanity was left to ponder the implications.

The first order of business for any serious people was, of course, re-establishing contact. The aliens had left behind a generic booklet of documentation on how to build FTL trading beacons and spaceports. Since construction materials on different planets would vary, it was generic and focused more on protocol than instruction. They didn't need to teach humanity Material Sciences 101: if you can get into space, you can build a Galactic Standard spaceport.

There were a few formulas and systems of math in the book that were incredibly interesting to scientists and engineers, but overall it didn't represent a radical change in our understanding of how the universe works.

These are the temperatures and pressures at which water boils.

This is the standard strength of iron.

This is the distance light can travel in a vacuum while certain atoms decay. And so on.

As it turned out, building a place for spaceships to land wasn't that complex. You just needed something hard, durable, and flat that could withstand a little bit of heat and wear. Experts verified using the formulas in the booklet that concrete would do just fine.

Normally, environmental reviews would need to be done, the sound pollution would need to be contained. Hundreds of tests needed to be conducted on site before the first concrete truck started pouring, but from what the frogheads said, if you built it, the traders were gonna come, and nobody wanted to be left out of what was going to be the new gold rush, so money changed hands, gears were greased.

Even in California, the capital of NIMBYs and tree huggers, people could smell an opportunity if it boomed down from orbit and bonked them in the nose with it. As it did in this case.

Thus, Livermore Spaceport was built.

What used to be a bunch of warehouses and parking lots just a short five minute drive from Lawrence Livermore National Labs was now a rapidly growing construction site. It was close enough to the San Francisco Bay Area metro that people could commute to it and see the first of the new generation FTL spacecraft take off and land, but far enough that they don't have to hear about it when they sleep.

BREAKING: LIVERMORE SPACEPORT OPERATIONAL

Looking up from her morning coffee, that's what the muted TV screen was trumpeting in big words on the CNN ticker. The mayor was talking, judging by the scrolling captions, something about how this will bring new jobs and money to the city.

Sarah snorted. Everything is always breaking news. She absent mindedly watched as the TV played stock footage of the antenna being installed last month and humanity's first interstellar ships took off and landed on the concrete lot as she sipped her coffee.

Sarah Miller would not call herself a hard worker. She graduated from the University of Washington with a degree in Communications, not exactly a field high in demand. When she got offered a job as a ""marketing person"" at a tech startup in SF, she grabbed it, more like you'd grab a life raft and less like it was an opportunity of a lifetime or anything.

Then, two years later, the startup failed. Funding dried up, and now she was out of a job in a metro with some of the highest cost of living in the world, with not exactly the hottest resume.

So now she was sitting at a breakfast shop just outside her rented apartment in Livermore, checking her emails to see whether she got any replies on her job applications (she had not) and contemplating how long she'd last before she'd have to go home to live with her parents in Seattle.

It was not exactly a fun thought.

""You going to the spaceport opening too, Sarah?"" Rudely interrupted from her self pity, she looked to see the woman across from her. She racked her memory to match the face to a name, but nothing came immediately. Mid to late 20s, Asian American, hipster glasses, t-shirt and jeans.

The writing on the coffee cup in her hand said her name was ""Jan"". Ah, yes, they met a few times on the BART commute into the city. Was her name Jan or...

""Hey Jen, naw I was just staring at the news, how's it going?""

""Great! What about you? Haven't seen you on the BART for a few. You still working at that place downtown?""

Sarah sighed internally, here it is again. ""Not anymore, we just got shut down. So I'm pretty much just lounging around.""

""Aww that's terrible,"" Jen looked down as her phone vibrated. ""Things are pretty rough at our company too... Sorry, my ride's here I gotta get to work, but you should come with me to see the aliens on Saturday!""

""Sure, I'll message you on Facebook."" Sarah cringed inside as she'd said yes by reflex. She didn't know Jen that well. On the other hand, it's not like she had anything else to do on Saturday.

Ah well, what's the worst thing that could happen? I guess they could crash and explode, she mused morbidly, but then I wouldn't have to worry about paying rent anymore.

---

Sarah found Jen near the entrance of the spaceport, along with at least ten thousand people. It looked like the entire Bay Area showed up and were lining up to get in. Jen was holding onto a- shopping cart?

""Jen, hey, what's with the shopping cart?"" There were dozens of fruits and vegetables stacked on the bottom of the cart, and an ice box on top.

""Aha, finally found you,"" Jen leaned over to her ear as if conspiratorially, ""I heard online that they'll let you in first if you're selling something to the aliens, so I went shopping.""

She opened up the icebox, revealing stacks of meat in ice, frowning, ""I'm not sure whether aliens can even eat our food but maybe this will get us past the line at least.""

Jen turned out to be right. The security guards at the gate had a separate line letting anyone in that looked like they had something to sell. It turned out Jen wasn't the only one with the bright idea. Several other groups with shopping carts in front of them were being x-ray scanned into the port. They waved good naturedly at the long line of excited people in line as they passed and got a few whoops and cheers in return.

Sarah and Jen were led into the prioritized waiting area, where they could see several large yellow and white targets on the concrete, evidently where the alien spaceships were going to land.

---

They saw it first before they heard it. 

First one, then several more, spaceships descended from the sky, accompanied by sonic booms. They couldn't be mistaken for human rockets, but there was a certain familiarity. Long, pointy, utilitarian hull shapes with rocket flames coming out the bottom. Like modern cars that all look like they're designed in a wind tunnel, it seems like there's one efficient way to build spaceships, and everyone stuck to it.

As they touched down gently on the target landing pads, Sarah thought to herself that it was nice to know that at least we were on the right track. Human ships can't maneuver as sharply, nor are they anywhere near the same scale and size, but at least we got the shapes right.

The ships settled on the concrete landing pads without so much as a crunch. A small hatch opened at the bottom of each, and a walkway ramp rolled down.

At some hidden signal, the security guard gestured to the small waiting crowd with shopping carts that they were free to approach, and the dazed vendors sprang into action.

---

The alien they've just greeted through a translator calls himself ""Zarko"". He was apparently part of a species of rock planet humanoids called the Zeepil that came from a system about 200 light years from Earth, and his skin had a charred appearance that almost made him look like a heavily sunburnt sloth on two legs.

""Let me guess, what you've brought is your native foods,"" Zarko's translator said in a monotone Stephen Hawking voice that did not match the movement of what looked like his lips.

""Yes! How did you guess? Can you guys eat the same food we can?"" Sarah mirrored Jen's question from earlier, ""we have a lot of fruits and vegetables"". She stopped herself from mentioning the steaks and chicken in their icebox. She figured there's no knowing whether these aliens think of eating other animals the same way most humans do, so let's start with the safe stuff first.

""We consume silicon and uranium for sustenance,"" Zarko made a strange face and then burped, ""I am joking. Every newcomer species asks the same question. Most species share the same diet. Some species eat meat from other animals. Sentient meat is of course illegal on most planets.""

Relieved that Jen didn't just waste hundreds of dollars on groceries, they showed Zarko their wares. And with their permission, it sampled some of each goods they had, including some of the raw vegetables and meat.

""Good, good,"" Zarko was pleased, there was a high amount of sugar and starch in a lot of the wares he'd tried. The Gaks would be impressed the next time he stopped at their planet.

""Can we see what you have?"" Jen said. After all, this was supposed to be a trade, right? She pushed a funny image of the aliens grabbing all their stuff and just taking off out of her mind. They wouldn't go through all the trouble of coming here just to steal some fruit... would they?

""Yes, yes,"" Zarko pulled out a tray of gadgets and started describing his goods to them.

He had spaceship rated fire extinguishers that looked like slightly oversized aerosol cans.

He had several first aid kits with basic bandaging and wound cleaning, safe for humans of course. They were packaged in plastic looking boxes with an alien looking skull marked on all six sides. Looks like the red cross symbol isn't so universal anymore.

He pulled out what was obviously a weapon, at which point Jen and Sarah looked nervously around at the security guards, but they didn't seem to notice. According to Zarko, it was a civilian hunting rifle with 12 laser shots in it, making it very illegal to own in the state of California. They shook their heads at that one and asked to see something else.

He had an advanced math calculator in base 24, from another humanoid species that had 6 fingers on each of its 4 hands. Interesting.

He had what he called a ""stasis box"" which would apparently keep food safe to eat for years. A mini space fridge, basically.

Zarko also claimed to have tons of raw materials in his ship, including what he called ""better concrete"" and ""better steel"". The translator had some problems with these; it seems like they just hadn't been invented on Earth yet, but with most of Earth's vendors only wielding small sized shopping carts and trolleys, he didn't bother to bring them out for show.

After a little bit of haggling, Sarah and Jen settled on 4 of the first aid kits, with instruction kits printed in English. Sarah reasoned that they could probably fetch a much higher price if they resold them as ""alien artifacts"" online, and Jen deferred to Sarah's experience in selling her old stuff online.

Jen kept asking questions about technology. She was interested in knowing what the aliens did for... everything, but with the next group of excited college kids with a cart behind them clamoring for a turn, they didn't want to dawdle.

It was, Sarah realized, the most interaction she'd had with another human since she lost her job, and that's not even counting the sloth alien.

---

Jen agreed to let Sarah sell the stuff online and divide the profits 50/50 after recouping Jen's meager grocery costs. Sarah knew Jen was being generous on account of her not having a job, but she wasn't about to complain.

As she got home around midnight, Sarah immediately got onto Craigslist and thought about where to list ""alien first aid kits"". Technically, it could be under ""household items"", or ""tools"", but ""collectibles"" would probably get them the most-

That's when she found the ""alien"" section. Of hecking course. For a website that looks like it was made in the 90s, they'd already adjusted to the latest fad with remarkable speed. She found dozens of listings of alien items that she saw that Zarko was parading around, and quite a few that he didn't have.

There were no other first aid kits listed on the market. Which was strange, because she definitely saw dozens of those being sold by the other traders. Hm... without a starting price, it was hard to gauge how much she should be selling it for.

She refreshed the page out of habit and watched the new items scroll in.

Her first reaction was: Ah, someone just posted a first aid kit.

Her second reaction was: Wait, for how much?

There was a listing of a first aid kit for $20,000. Which was ridiculous. It's a collectible, but a box of bandages was not worth the price of a brand new car.

Something nagging at her instinct, Sarah opened one of them up. It was just a bunch of bandages, syringes, and basic medical stuff. Some of it had the wrong shapes, or had a different color than they'd normally be, but there's only so many ways to bandage an open wound, and everything looked familiar-ish. She read the English manual that Zarko had printed for her. It said:

""Rated for human use. Includes:

Bandage 4 rolls,

Skin adhesive 16 pieces,

Pain relief cream 2 ounces,

Radiation exposure injection 2 doses,

Cold relief medicine 24-""

Wait what? Radiation exposure injection? Like in case the spaceship hull leaks or something?

Sarah skimmed through the list and looked at usage instructions for:

""Radiation exposure injection: use in case of emergency hull exposure. Rapidly repairs cell and bone marrow damage for patients with acute radiation exposure and kills all cancer cell growth in body. Dose takes effect within 30 seconds. Side effects may include nausea, dehydration, drowsiness...""

Her blood chilled. She read it again.

And again to be certain.

Then she wiped away the sweat around her eyes to make sure she wasn't dreaming.

""Kills all cancer cell growth in body.""

She looked at her laptop and refreshed the page. The previous first aid kit listing she saw had been taken down, presumably sold for $20,000. If this kit did what it said it would...

Excited, she refreshed the online listing page again. She saw two listings for the alien first aid kit, both up to over $100,000 now.

Refresh.

A million. Some guy was selling a darn first aid kit for a million dollars.

This was incredible. Some corner of her brain whined something about putting a price on health, but she cast that out of her mind to refresh again and see more listings in the millions of dollars. And she was holding four of them in her lap.

Half an hour later, it seemed that the prices had stabilized around $4 million, the price of a small closet in downtown San Fran.

This was evidently the market price for the life of a cancer patient.

Horrific.

She put up a listing for $15 million for her four boxes.

Instantly, her email inbox started getting notifications, a number of apparently wealthy individuals with sick relatives desperate to buy a miracle cure that hadn't even been tested or proven on humans yet, introducing themselves and sharing their life stories.

There was a guy who owned a large database company but had recently been diagnosed with lung cancer. He knew he should have stopped smoking years ago, but he needed something to manage the stress.

Another, a business executive, who had a heartbreaking story of her dad dying of liver cancer.

Then, a short and simple ""Willing to offer twenty million in cash today for all 8 doses of anti-radiation medicine in alien aid kit, J&amp;J VP of Research and Innovation, Alexi G.""

She looked him up online.

He was legit, from a big pharma R&amp;D.

She reasoned that maybe selling to someone who could do research on it would help more people. And he was offering more...

She replied.

He wanted to meet at their company office downtown first thing in the morning.

-

Alexi had made good on his offer. He hadn’t tried to haggle the price, as she’d know some Craigslist buyers would try to do once you met them in person. It was generally considered a jerk move.

It was Saturday so the offices were mostly empty, except for one conference room with several employees as well as Alexi. She handed over her duffel bag with the four kits, he opened and checked each to make sure their contents were all there, and handed over a cashier’s check for the agreed amount. 

And that was it.

It had taken her bank an hour to process the check, and another several hours to clear it. The money appeared in her account around midnight, at which point Sarah let out a breath she didn’t know she’d been holding for a day.

Sarah was rich.

---

Sarah got out her phone to text Jen the news.

Huh, there was an email notification ""Hey Sarah, thank you for your interest in applying to be our marketing assistant. If you can send us your resume and a co-""

Delete.

---

Twenty million dollars was a lot of money.

Neither Sarah nor Jen had ever seen that much money, but they knew enough to leave something like this to a professional.

An accountant at a Big Four company helped them divide up the assets and ballparked how much they’d eventually need to render unto Uncle Sam the things that were his come April 15th.

Sarah paid all her bills on time, a first in months. 

Jen quit her job the next day. After all, what was the point of being a web developer for a measly six figure salary when there was a gold rush next door?

Figuratively speaking. 

They both vaguely knew the history of the gold seekers during the California Gold Rush.

Some of them struck it rich, but some found nothing in the river beds of the Sacramento. The people who had made the most money in 1849 were actually not the flood of gold prospectors who came into the area.

The people that had gotten the richest out of the gold boom were the merchants who sold them the prospecting equipment they used, the services they needed, the food they ate, and the clothes they wore. The masses of pioneers who came for a new life in the American West: they were the real gold rush.

Most people today do not know the name of a single gold seeker. 

Most people today have heard of some of the merchants who got rich off of the gold seekers’ businesses. Levi Strauss, John Studebaker, Sam Brannan.

And of course, Henry Wells and William Fargo.

---

This was the fourth time they've been back to the spaceport, Sarah thought, and they'd gotten something new each time. They'd dealt with different traders each time, though they did see Zarko at least one other time as he was leaving with a full hold of fresh fruit. 

After the first couple days, the alien traders had noticed that there seemed to be shortage of first aid kits on Earth, and the inevitable flood of anti-cancer syringes being put online dramatically lowered its listing price.

Several large pharmaceutical companies had also issued press releases that they were within months of the development of generic anti-cancer medicine. The lawyers were working overdrive over the IP implications of adapted alien technology, but there didn't seem to be any laws preventing companies from doing it...

Which brought its price down to the tens of thousands. Nothing to sneeze at for most people, of course, but it was a literal cure for cancer and well within range of some of the other items the aliens were known to bring.

Today, Zarko was trying to sell her and Jen on some kind of liquid medical adhesive in industrial quantities. Some hardy tree-like species use it to glue deep wounds together or something, but Sarah saw a few listings for it on Craigslist a couple days ago that had no takers, even for cheap. Medical companies must have thought it not really worth pursuing as Earth already had similar products.

Unfortunately for Zarko, he'd already filled his cargo hold with tons of the liquid after hearing how well medical supplies were selling on Earth. His entrepreneurial spirit was rewarded with an empty paw. It was beginning to look like he'd need to dump his cargo for a few boxes of worthless V'ton trinkets on his way home.

Sarah and Jen had driven all the way out here with an U-Haul truck worth of pears, and most of the other traders were ready to leave for the next cycle of traders to come in anyway. They could dump it on Zikzik, the trader next door, but all he has left are a bunch of ""better steel"". Apparently some construction companies are learning to work with it, but from what she heard, it was annoying to sell those because the regulations around these new building materials were still being looked at.

And they looked soooo heavy to have to carry home.

Sarah had learned to read a little more of the humanoid sloth's facial expressions, and he was clearly not happy about having made a trip for nothing. ""Tell you what, Zarko. I'll give you the fruit, and you can bring me my goods the next time you come back,"" she said.

Zarko's snout perked up as he thought. Fundamentally, Zarko considers himself an honest trader. He doesn't cheat or skimp on quality of materials, and he doesn't lie about what he sells. Sure, he embellishes a little sometimes, as all traders do, but who doesn't?

Zarko has never taken on debt to a customer. He's heard of other traders doing this, but the far more common use of debt across the galaxy was to trap people into a lifetime of hard work in unpleasant conditions.

But Sarah and Jen didn't seem like the kind of people who would be capable of doing that.

For a second, Zarko thought about cheating them. Just take their fruits, and never come back to Earth, but immediately he put the thought out of his mind. That was not the right thing to do.

Zarko thought about it for a while, and agreed. He'll just have to remember to bring more first aid kits next time right?

---

""Did you see the way Zarko reacted to the IOU?"" Sarah asked Jen on the way home.

""Yeah, do you think he'll just abscond with the fruit?""

""Nah, apparently the pears are selling out like hotcakes. He can't just leave Earth and never come back. I heard Zikzik say he got a brand new reactor upgrade just from one trip of pears alone,"" Sarah sounded confident, and hoped that she was right. Something else was bothering her about the alien traders.

""Good. Maybe he's worried we're naive or something and someone else will take advantage of us,"" Jen brainstormed.

Naive? For what? Getting cheated out of a truck full of ugly pears Safeway was gonna throw out at the end of the day? Then, it dawned on her.

""I think there's something missing,"" Sarah said slowly, thinking about their past interactions with the alien traders, ""they don't think about selling things the way we do.""

""You mean they don't have money?"" Sarah smiled and rolled her eyes in her head, of course Jen was thinking about money.

""Yeah. Come to think of it, they clearly don't live in some kind of Star Trek galaxy where everything is free,"" Sarah continues her train of thought, gears turning in her head, ""they just barter and haggle for all our stuff.""

""They don't have money, they don't have debt, they don't have Craigslist!"" Jen blurted, the implication of this was beginning to excite the inner businesswoman in her that she's been discovering the past week.

""Coming to the spaceport is their Craigslist, but without money or debt, they must also not have a lot of the other stuff we take for granted,"" Sarah was already making a list in her head, ""that explains why the small variety of consumer goods they have are all related space travel and cargo storage, and why most of their big trade is in industrial goods. They can't have banks! What about loans and mortgages! What about paying fines! How do they even buy stuff normally?""

""Ah, must be such a simple and happy existence without having to think about money,"" Jen said wistfully.

""Yup, let's go ruin it.""",/r/HFY/comments/l0ce6b/galactic_economics_1_happy_existence/,17

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Picking up where we left off Nick’s possibly dead body was laying on a church floor in a different world after slamming into its rafters at terminal velocity. Let me also remind you that Nick had several broken ribs. After exactly one day he awoke just as the scripture said. Nick started to roll over first noticing that his ribs hurt he grabbed his side and spoke these words unaware of the priests who were watching. “ahhoww...AAGGHH FUcking BITCH that hurts oh GOD fucking DAMN IT aGHHHH Jesus” he rolled back over to his original position, “oww”

He started to lift his hand to touch his head which was also sore. But exerting force on his ribs, he moaned and stopped. He turned his head to look at the walls which were somewhat unremarkable even for a church. He then turned his head toward the priests who were staring at him. He stared back at them and for several minutes they said nothing but just stared at each other. “My ribs are broken,” he said finally giving a half-assed smile. They stared at him giving him the same half-assed smile back.

He started to speak “my ribs are broken they don’t work… can you help me?” he said slowly talking like they were children. The priests who had been standing all night somewhat in anticipation were slightly dazed and tired one of them was standing with his eyes open while sleeping. Nick after talking to them normally realized that wouldn’t work. Sighing he spoke to himself at first. “Well fuck” he started to drag himself toward them with his armor scraping along the ground. this was as one might imagine a grueling task. Nick in obvious pain started to groan. 

With this one of the priests woke from their daze hearing the scrape of metal on stone and groaning. Looking down he watched in horror as the body dragged itself toward him. Overcome with terror at the sight of something seemingly dead crawl his way, he tried to protect himself stomping on it repetitively, and started to scream. Nick who was being kicked stopped crawling and started to yell “agh fuck off, ay... AY, FUCK OFF” at this the priest stopped and the other two awoke.

The priest looked terrified but this time for a different reason he dropped to his knees and began to pray “Goddess Sylvia I beg for forgiveness for I have made transgressions against the hero which you have sent.” at this particular moment Sylvia wasn’t paying attention and even if she were couldn’t have cared less.

Nick looked at him “oh wow I don’t even get the apology, that’s cool…”

The priest looked up “I am so sorry.”

“Nah it’s good, just you know... maybe next time don’t curb stomp someone asking for help,” Nick said out of breath, “also my ribs are broken I was wondering if you could do something about that.”

The priest got up and started to speak hurridly “thank you for granting me your forgiveness, I will grab the town doctor right away.”

As the priest left, the other two started to speak with themselves. “It’s true he is the hero we must let the townspeople know.”

“No, not yet he has requested aid, which we shall give before anything else”

Nick watched them as they conversed and after some thought as to what his first comment should be asked “you said townspeople, right? where am I.” Nick had his memories from the conversation with Sylvia and in an attempt to think of his situation like a videogame came up with that comment. 

The Priest responded “You have arrived in the town of Prostate”

Nick let me remind you, was a fairly average college student and along with this so was his humor he started to laugh “ah haah oww fuck that hurts” he wheezed holding his sides. He lay there breathing heavily for a little “why would you name it that?”

The priest looked at him “why are you laughing? It is an ancient word of power given to us by a former hero who sadly died fighting the demon lord.”

Nick started to laugh again but stopped after a little due to the pain “word of power... okay”

“You seem to take it lightly. As though you do not know its meaning.”

Nick shifted his head “ok then, tell me what does it mean?”

The priest put up a finger “it means the strength of will.”

Nick still laying there said, “oh cool now tell me where did this hero say they were from?”

The priest responded, “it was told that he came from a land called San Francisco.”

“Really?”

“Yes really he had blazing red eyes and was considered a great philosopher”

Nick laughed this time with his hands on his ribs already “Holy Shit, oww… ah ha oh my god so you’re telling me this man was tripping balls and then proceeded to name your town after the prostate. now that is legendary, I will give him that.”

The priest looked at Nick “the Prostate? What do you mean by the Prostate?”

Thinking about how to phrase it he tried to think of the medical terms for describing it. This proved fruitless however because he didn’t know so he described it as he would to a friend. “It’s a thing in your asshole that makes you cum when touched right.” The priests recoiled and Nick inside his helmet smiled. “I love that you know what it really means, and now you have to live in a town named after it.”

The first priest who had left now returned and in tow was a woman. They entered to see a crippled man in a suit of armor on the ground laughing and two priests with disgusted faces staring at each other.

The first priest looked at them “I assume I have missed something possibly important.” the two priests stared at him. “Well, would you please document it for later?”

One of them spoke, “Umm… sorry, but no.”

Nick was laughing despite the pain. At this point, he was hopped up on adrenaline and wasn’t feeling it nearly as much. The priest sighed and motioned to Nick “he needs healing.” 

The woman approached him, she wore white robes and carried a staff with her. She had short blonde hair that reached her shoulder and soft lips and skin. In a soft voice, she asked, “could you please remove your helmet?”

“No, my hands don’t reach that high” Nick said without hesitation

She looked at him and nodded gently lifting it off. Nick was once again average, he was decent looking not ugly but not good looking he worked out enough to have some muscle but not enough to compensate for his face. The woman who was tending to him introduced herself as Iris she spoke to Nick “now I need you to drink this, it will help with the process internally.” Nick nodded and she handed him a white gel-like substance. 

Nick looked at her “it looks like cum...”

She blushed, “oh no it’s nothing like that.”

He stared at it, “it does though.”

She lifted it toward his mouth “please drink it...” he puckered his lips at first, realizing Nick didn’t want to drink it, but it was needed for recovery she hooked the edge of the jar on his teeth and tilted it back pouring glops of the liquid down his throat. Nick retched feeling the stuff go down, there was also something else to it, that being capacitation.

She tilted the jar the rest of the way apologizing as it seeped down his throat. “Ugh why is it spicy,” he shuddered and started to retch again.

Iris stood up and began to chant something after a little Nick who was mumbling to himself began to glow green and internally his ribs started to repair. Looking at Nick Iris spoke “I apologize for the unpleasantness of that, but it was the best we had, when I heard that it was the hero who needed attention I grabbed our most powerful remedy.” she looked sad “but that’s it, we don’t have anymore.”

Nick stared at her then thinking about similar situations he had watched said “I guess this is where I help you get what you need for it.” 

She looked up “really you would do that for me?”

Nick thinking about the leveling system responded “yeah why not.”

The priests interrupted “we have not had a banquet yet for your arrival.”

Nick spoke, “considering this is where I awoke and this is my first objective it shouldn’t be too difficult, I’ll be right back.” this was true but also he felt he needed to learn the mechanics of the world if he was to survive.

The priests agreed and after some time Iris and Nick headed out, the problem wasn’t that it was difficult to acquire the ingredients, it was more so that it was four miles away because well, distance is a thing and not everything is right there for you. As Iris led Nick to the location he started to look at her realizing she was quick for her size, Nick was used to weights but not endurance after two miles or so he started to slow down, the adrenaline was no longer effective and he could feel the weight of the armor now. For the rest of the way, he seemed to drag himself, and after three miles trudging along in plate armor he was consistently stopping for breaks, this was not the only problem, however.  After close to five hours of walking, Nick was exhausted and as a human, spicey things moved fast through him.

Iris stopped in front of a large field, “here we are,” she said

Nick asked, “so what are we gathering?”

Iris turned toward him “we’re gathering slime, this is a slime field. They’re fairly easy to find and when you kill them they burst open. There’s a small sack inside that we need to collect, you don’t need to worry about cutting it open it’s pretty ridged.” after this explanation and a few questions they started to wander around the field. Iris as Nick noted went over a hill and was nowhere to be seen, on his own side he tried to find the slimes she had described but to no avail. 

As he looked a sudden feeling came over him, Nick knew what it was, he looked around frantically for Iris but once again she was nowhere to be seen, he rushed over to a tree on the edge of the field. And looked around once more. Upon seeing that he was alone he relaxed, not completely though, it wasn’t that in anime slimes often ate clothes and if that were the case in this world Iris would be completely naked, no this wasn’t what concerned him, Nick had to poop, Nick took off his grieves and leaned against the tree. The interesting thing about them was that they were directly made from his clothes same as his chest plate and helmet. You see when Nick died he was wearing a hat, a shirt, and pants which became his armor. Now it is particularly difficult to poop in full plate armor due to the weight, this resulted in Nick taking of the chest armor and helmet as well.

Nick at this point was completely naked. Sitting there he watched as a slime dripped down from the tree he was pooping under landing on his armor. Nick had no problem with this until it started to crawl its way down toward him. Thankfully with his quick thinking and sharp wits, he grabbed a rock from next to the tree about the size of a football and slammed it down onto the slime and armor with enough force that it shattered the already cracked armor. Nick now had now clothes or armor to put back on after he was done. Finishing he looked at the tree, it was a pine tree. To his horror, he heard Iris calling out to him. Frantically he looked around spotting a forest on the far side of the field.

With his quick thinking and sharp wits, he decided to make a break for it. This, however, was not so easy as slimes had a hive mind, and the field was now cloaked in them Nick was angrily yelling as he tried to make his way through. Iris at the same time was making her way over the hill to check on Nick, but upon arriving at the top, the view would to the untrained eye looked like a caveman wandering around a field grunting as they used a big ass rock to smash cat-sized amoebas into the ground, but in reality, it was the world’s hero duck-walking across the field because of a poopy asshole using the only weapon they could find to stave off hordes of angry slimes in order to reach the forest so he could use leaves to wipe off the shit since the branches of coniferous trees were the plant equivalent of a hedgehog.

Sylvia who returned to watch how Nick was adjusting to the new world stared disappointed. Here a man with the reasoning skills of a 4-year-old was inadvertently subjecting one of the most innocent women in this world to whatever bullshittery he was currently doing.",/r/HFY/comments/l1l98t/american_isekai_ch2/,17

Then, he quickly looted the three goblin carcasses to claim his loot and started moving deeper into the forest.

He willed his notifications tab to open, though he wasn't really expecting anything too surprising.

 \[*Killed* Goblin Skirmisher (Level 1) x 3 - 75 XP, 30 EP Awarded  

Looted- Goblin Knives, *Inferior*

Spiked Bludgeon, *Inferior*

Goblin Short sword, *Inferior\]*

""Kinda disappointing"" Noah sighed, though he had expected it. ""So, what now?"" he asked Liam, as he proceeded deeper into the forest after crushing the remnants of the wooden box that he had worked so hard for under his foot. There was no reason to give anyone free hints, after all. Jake didn't exactly seem like the person who'd go around making friends and telling people how to get stronger, and that worked out perfectly fine for Noah. He preferred to milk this advantage for as long as possible, especially if he was going to keep running into monsters like The Safer.

""Hmm, I guess you're ready to know more now"" Liam answered, and Noah's ears perked up. ""You see kid, if you were to ask me whether I was dead or alive.... Well, you're not gonna like this answer.""

""Tell me. I can handle it"" Noah shot back, as this was one of the questions he had been curious about. But demi-god or not, 'are you dead' was still far too brazen of a question to ask for *Noah,* and he suspected that behind The Eternal Lion's *holier than thou* attitude was a pretty normal person who felt emotions the same way he did.

""Well, technically I am alive, but in reality, it is fair to say that I am more dead than alive. I don't really understand how time travel works, but I have a few conjectures based on what little information the Tower offered me. My soul was essentially ripped from my body, and if you were to equate Time to a continuously flowing river, thrown back towards a fixed location while taking the full brunt of the rapids head-on as I moved against the flow of the water"" explained Liam with a solemn expression.

""Can you explain what that implies in layman terms?"" Asked Noah, knowing that this wasn't the best time to express his scientific curiosity.

""Well, my soul is severely fractured, and about half of it has been completely eroded. It takes quite a bit of divine sense to maintain the shape of my soul, and I can only maintain this physical form for roughly half a day. Don't fret too much though, because it's honestly better than expected.... I didn't really expect to survive after using \[The Inheritance\] skill. I don't know why I'm still alive, maybe it's because time travel isn't an exact science, or if the Tower's arrangements have deteriorated with the passage of time. But in layman's terms, *you're on your own for the night shift.*"" said Liam, as he waved his hands and a pair of silvery-white headphones materialized around his ears.

""What!? You're joking, right!? This has to be in exchange for calling your jokes shitty. I'm sorry, okay? This isn't funny."" Noah started protesting, hoping against hope that this was just a prank in poor taste.

""Ah, the pure, unadulterated glory of British Rap. You tasteless Americans could never find it within yourself to appreciate true art"" Liam muttered contentedly, as he admired the beautiful forest scenery around him.

Noah gave a defeated sigh, finally accepting that Liam was not bluffing. Earlier he had been wondering how scary and unnerving it would be to face Gridlocked completely alone, and now he'd be forced to find out. His tendency to overthink everything now came back to bite him in the ass, and he felt like kicking a brick wall.

""Do you know why I did it?"" asked the Eternal Lion, as he absentmindedly stared at the false sky.

""Did what?"" Noah asked, exasperated by this point.

""Swallowed my pride and sacrificed myself to go back in time, only to reduce myself to this pathetic state,"" The Eternal Lion asked, slightly chuckling as he finished the question.

""Because you wanted to save humanity?"" Noah asked as if it were obvious.

""Save humanity. What are you lad, five years old? The Eternal Lion was many things, but a saint was not one of them. I didn't do it to save wankers that I'd never seen or spoken to like that rat Jake from before, and neither did I have much hope that the tosser that inherits my memories will actually use them for the 'greater good' and follow my instructions instead of becoming a power-tripping asshole. I didn't even think I'd be alive to see it happen, so it wasn't my problem to deal with."" The Eternal Lion calmly admitted that his decision wasn't originally made for some noble or selfless cause, and his admission left Noah speechless.

""Now that I've been given another chance, I will do everything in my power to help you save both the people you care about and as much of humanity as we can. But, I'd be lying to you if I said that was my original intention is what I mean kid, sorry for sounding so harsh."" he apologetically explained.

""Just, why then?"" Noah asked, unable to discern the reasons behind his self-contradictory actions.

""Because... I am just as daft as you kid"" replied Liam, and burst out in a peal of loud, mocking laughter. ""*In a world where The Eternal Lion never existed, would the companions that he had convinced to accompany him to the top have a less miserable end? Even if it was only a hundred years before humanity's fated end came regardless of his sacrifice to prevent it- if they could pass those years in peace and away from the carnage... it was all I could ever ask for, is what I thought as I condemned myself to this fate.""*",/r/HFY/comments/l209ld/the_primordial_tower_chapter_15_heart_to_heart/,5
70,l6cujm,HFY,Wed Jan 27 21:55:29 2021,Semper Shil'vati: An SSBverse Story: Chapter 1,"Another story that takes place in the Sexy Space Babes universe written by [/u/BlueFishcake](https://www.reddit.com/u/BlueFishcake/). He owns the story, I just got permission to write my own.

Chapter 1: Remembrance

Six Years. It had been six years since Zachary O’Connor had left the United States Marine Corps. Well, saying he left wouldn’t be entirely correct. The Marine Corps, like every other military force on the planet, had been forcibly disbanded when the Shil’vati invaded Earth. There were only a few hours of warning that they were coming, as the massive fleet of ships approaching Earth was spotted by satellites and ground observatories the world over. Governments tried their best to prepare, but against what was coming, a year’s worth of preparation would still have led to defeat.

They blasted the world’s satellite grid to pieces, and began a systematic campaign of orbital striking all obvious military bases across the planet. Some nuclear weapons were launched from their silos, but not a single one ever made it close to a Shil’vati ship. Some units had managed to quickly deploy from their bases before they were attacked and overwhelmed, but many were caught unaware. Police in the major cities could do nothing as untold numbers of Shil’vati infantry and support craft marched down the streets of every city from New York to Tokyo.

That’s not to say there was no military resistance, but there wasn’t much that could’ve been done to the sheer numbers being thrown against them. Fighters that were in the sky got lucky here and there, but were swatted down in less than an hour. Naval ships lasted the longest, and arguably did the most damage, but ultimately failed to stop the purple skinned invaders. Zachary though, he considers himself both lucky and guilty for where he was.

He was with the 3rd Marine Division on Okinawa, on a field training exercise when everything hit the fan. He and his fellow Marines, alongside Japanese and Australian troops, had been part of a training op that involved them operating in a forested area. Part of that job was to conceal the vehicles they had under camouflage netting, to avoid detection from OPFOR drones during the exercise. Those preparations however became useful for another reason all together. He remembered hearing the sounds of explosions far on the other side of the island, and seeing F-18’s flying overhead, as well as Alien gunships, shooting at one another. Meanwhile a ground force was moving in on their location, but they didn’t know exactly where they were.

Using the element of surprise, they waited until they got within range before they even thought of firing. Aiming down the sight of his .50 caliber rifle, he took aim at the clearest target he could see in his scope. When the order was given, the entire line opened up with everything on the unsuspecting soldiers. He pulled the trigger, the recoil kicking hard into his shoulder, but his eye stayed on his target, who crumpled when the shot connected with her chestplate. From all along the defensive line, he watched thousands of bullets fly towards them, but most just bounced off their armor. Some staggered and tripped from the barrage of bullets, but their standard rifles did nothing to the chestpiece of the armor suit they wore.

“We can’t penetrate the armor!” a friend of his shouted shortly before getting caught in the chest with a laser blast. He dropped to his knees and slumped over the log he was taking cover behind.

“PROPHET!” Zachary screamed as one his buddies from boot camp dropped dead onto the forest ground. He sighted back in, scanning the direction of where the shot came from, and saw another alien, this one in more ornate armor, taking cover behind a tree. He breathed out, and pulled the trigger as soon as his target popped back out. Once again, another alien crumpled to the ground, dead as disco. But as he was about to sight back in, a loud explosion erupted from his right. The tank they had hidden had been discovered, and was destroyed by a gunship that appeared above them.

“We’ve got to fucking fall back!” he heard another marine shout as the gunship raked the area with fire. Marines and soldiers alike fell to the death machine hovering above them. It was only thanks to a stinger rocket slamming into its side, and sending it crashing to the ground, that any of them managed to survive long enough to retreat. The last few vehicles that were hidden had been destroyed by the advancing aliens, and what was left of the marines and their allies were in full retreat. They scattered as best as they could, hoping to avoid the roving squads, coupled with air support, that were roaming the forests of Okinawa.

“This is fucking bullshit!” Zachary said to no one as he silently, but quickly moved his way through the forest, hoping to attract the attention of either foot patrols or air support. He still heard sporadic gunfire, but it was dying down, just like their hopes of being able to win this fight. They dealt them a good blow, especially with the element of surprise, but that surprise lasted for a few minutes, before they got their shit kicked in.

“Over here!” he heard someone whisper off to his left. His eyes darted at a nearby bush, which had a hand sticking out of it, waving him down. “Get your drongo ass over here before you get shot!” the voice called again.” he recognized the accent and made his way over to the bush, where he found an Australian soldier, along with two of his fellow marines, and a JSDF member.

“Well I think we just got our fucking asses kicked.” the marine, another buddy of his named Perez, said as he peeked back towards the north.

“Well no shit, what gave you that idea, you fucking retard?” the other marine, Fernandez said aggravated. “We lasted all of two fucking minutes. Nothing we had could dent that armor they have!” he exclaimed.

“Well my fifty did, as did the 25 on the LAV’s, but that’s not saying anything good.” Zachary replied.

“Mate, if it takes anti material weapons to break through that armor, we’ve already lost.” the Australian said in a disappointing voice. “And from what our CO said over the radio before comms went down, we have it better here than everyone else because we were already dug in without them knowing.”

“So what do we do now?” the SDF member asked.

“I don’t think we can do much of anything anymore,” Fernandez said. “We just lost our heavy weapons, and Connor’s fifty isn’t going to win us a firefight.”

“But it might let me buy us some time if we absolutely need it. But if we run into any more than one or two of these bastards, my rifle won’t do us any good. Whoever these alien bastards are, they have good aim. They got Prophet through the chest with a single shot, and I don’t know how many others.”

“I’m not sure if we can keep up like this,” the Australian interrupted. “Might be best to surrender if we can, because we don’t have a hope in hell of winning this fight.”

“Assuming they’ll even let us surrender and won’t shoot us dead just because we resisted them earlier.” Perez said.

“Either that or we hoof it to the nearest village and hope for the best. Maybe it won’t be overrun, and we can escape by boat.” Zachary suggested.

“Or run straight into the enemy.” the Japanese soldier said. Before anyone could say anything else, branches ahead of them snapped, causing their ears to perk up, and for them to shut up and listen. The footsteps were faint, but noticeable. Then they heard a strange voice talking amongst the treeline. The language sounded strange to their ears, and not very deep. Peeking their heads out, they saw one of the alien soldiers scanning through the treeline, slowly making its way towards them. If the alien came closer, it would definitely find them.

“Get ready to bolt, I’ll give you guys covering fire,” Zachary told them. “Once I know it's clear, I’ll try and link back up with y'all. If more come rushing over here, don’t expect to see me.”

“Bullshit Connor, we aren’t leaving you behind!” Fernandez snapped at him.

“Someone has to provide cover fire in case that alien fucker ain’t alone out here!” he said. “And if I’m being honest, y’all have far more at home waiting for you than I do. Now get ready to fucking move, we ain’t got long before it gets here.” he said, readying his rifle, sighting in, and preparing to fire.

“Alright everyone, on three,” Fernandez said. “One, two, three!” he said, and the four of them leapt from the bush and made a beeline to the south, hoping not to get shot while doing so. The alien swivelled its sights and raised its rifle at them, but before it could fire, Zachary fired once more, this time right above the elbow, and watched as its arm flew off. The screams of agony that came from the alien however, were not what he expected.

“What the fuck?” Zachary said, confused as he heard the high pitched and feminine scream pierce the air. He got up from behind the bush he was hiding in, and slowly worked his way over the alien that was spasming on the ground, hoping to get a closer look at the alien. As he got close enough to view the alien, he saw the helmet was still tightly sealed to the suit. Zachary was curious, and wanted to see the face of the invader. Despite the aliens' protest, he managed to get the helmet off, to which he realized the alien wasn’t an it, but a her. “Holy shit!”

“T-toraga!” the alien said in a voice that sounded like a rough cross between German and Russian. Upon closer inspection, he realized his round had nearly completely severed the whole arm off. Just a bit above where the elbow would be, was all that was left. He knelt down next to the alien, who was trying, but failing to move away from him. Blue blood continued to gush from where his round made impact, and he tried to figure out what to do. A part of him wanted to kill her, take her rifle, and move on. She was an alien invader, part of a force that was in the process of taking over the planet. But at the same time, she was just a scared soldier, doing her duty, just as she’d been ordered to.

“What the hell are you?” he asked, not expecting her to understand. The alien was beautiful to him. Purple skin, golden sclera with a black iris, and tusks forming from her mouth. She looked like a damn orc, albeit far better looking than from any medieval fantasy novel he read. She obviously didn’t understand what he was saying, and he didn’t expect her to anyway. Her eyes were filled with terror as he knelt over her body, unsure of what was going to happen to her. He wanted so badly to get revenge on the enemy that had already taken so much from him, but he wasn’t willing to kill a defenseless being, no matter who they were. “Hold on lady, I ain’t leaving you like this.” he said reaching into his IFAK, pulling out his tourniquet.

“Karava?” the purple alien said to him. Just as she didn’t understand him, he didn’t understand her. Maybe a German or Russian could, but sure as hell not him. Using the knowledge drilled into him while in basic, he applied the tourniquet the best he could with what little of her arm was left. Slowly but surely, the bleeding stopped, and probably not too soon. There was already alot on the ground, and even if she wasn’t human, and taller than him, losing that much blood isn’t healthy.

“I’m not sure what else to do, but this should help for now,” he said, a sudden shout bringing him back to alertness, and looking up at the treeline. He could make out multiple alien soldiers coming his way, weapons drawn, and them speaking their gruff language. They knew he was there, they were closing in, and he had no options available. He turned his head back towards the girl on the ground, tears running down her face, but no longer screaming or wiggling around. “Maybe tell your people not to kill me, yeah?” he said as he looked back down at the girl, before returning his attention back to the alien soldiers that were surrounding him.

“Ser en dar!” one of them yelled to him, again a feminine voice attached to it. While the pronunciation of the word was horrible, the voice behind it gruffer than the other alien, he could understand what it meant.

“Alright, alright, I understand,” he said as he slowly got up, and placed his hands into the sky. “I might be a marine, but I’m not fucking stupid.” he said as the aliens approached him at a quicker pace. One kicked away the rifle that was to his side, while another forced him to his knees, took the M9 from his holster, and patted him down. However it seemed as if the alien was enjoying patting him down, as the rather firm squeeze given to him on his genitals was enough to make him turn his head, and raise an eyebrow at the alien. The alien laughed, again sounding feminine like.

As he listened to them talk, they all sounded female, which threw him off considerably. Not only that, they all stood at least 7’0 tall. He was an even 6’0, and knew some guys who were taller than him, but every last one of the aliens had the height of a basketball player. But as more and more of these aliens arrived, they became more and more agitated, probably because of their comrade missing one arm, and them finding him next to her. It all culminated when one of them pointed her rifle in his face ready to fire. All he could do was glare up at the alien towering over him, waiting for death. But it never came.

“Gorkan Tal!” another alien yelled to the one aiming the rifle at him. Upon looking at the alien, yet another female, he noticed she was younger than the others standing over him. In fact, if he had to guess by looking at her insignia, she was an officer. It would definitely fit, given how young she was, and how the older and more numerous soldiers obeyed her order. He was lifted onto his feet and marched with the squad of female soldiers until they reached an encampment.

From there he was sent to a POW camp that was located at Kadena Air Base. Wreckage of fighters, helicopters, and transport planes littered the runways, as well as what seemed to be thousands of soldiers from many nations. During his week-long stay there, before being shipped back to the United States, and eventually back home, he had met troops from Russia, China, the Philippines, Australia, both Koreas, Vietnam, Thailand, and even some French and Canadian troops. The story was more or less the same everywhere in the world. Even when they kept bringing more soldiers into the camp, the only news they heard was how badly defeated the world was.

The most damage done was from various nuclear subs who had gotten extremely lucky and scored some close ranged strikes on some landing zones that the aliens, known now as the Shil’vati Imperium, had used. Eventually though, any subs that didn’t get hunted down, surrendered at some point. They were the longest running organized resistance, and dealt the aliens the biggest blow, but a blow that cost more than a few cities in the process. In the end, Earth lost the fight pretty handedly, and over the next month, every soldier, marine, airman, and sailor was without a job, as did everyone who worked for various intelligence agencies around the world, and the defense industry. Only the Coast Guard was left in any recognizable form, but that’s because they were necessary. The rest were just cast out into a world forever changed, with no plan on what to do.

But that wasn’t the only thing that bothered Zachary as he sat down at the local bar, watching the news as the channel flipped to a feed of a Shil’vati flag flying over the Statue of Liberty. They had defiled many historical landmarks, and had taken their independence from them. They took millions of lives all over the globe, including his surviving family, during the war. So many of the friends he knew, were killed in the fighting. Others died as resistance fighters or committed suicide. The latter is something he considered whenever he thought about he was one of the few guys left alive from his original platoon. He downed another shot of rum and coke, hoping to get drunk enough to just fall asleep and forget his pain of remembering all he lost.

“And here I promised my mother I’d never drink,” he said, gesturing for the bartender to bring him another. “I’m so glad you aren’t here to see this mom, lord knows how ashamed you’d be with me.” he said in a sorrowful tone.

“I doubt she’d be ashamed of you for trying to numb your pain.” a voice behind him said. His eyes widened as he realized the accent and gruffness of the voice wasn’t human. He steeled himself as he turned his head and was greeted by two Shil’vati marines, one of which had a robotic right arm.",/r/HFY/comments/l6cujm/semper_shilvati_an_ssbverse_story_chapter_1/,101

**Mass Effect: Logical Conclusions, The First Shepard**

Old men forget; yet all shall be forgot but he’ll remember with advantages what feats he did that day. Then shall our names, familiar in his mouth as household words, Harry the King, Bedford and Exeter, Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester, be in their flowing cups freshly remembered. This story shall the good man teach his son and Crispin Crispian shall ne’er go by. From this day to the ending of the world, but we in it shall be remembered- We few we happy few, we band of brothers; For he today that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother be he ne’er so vile. This day shall gentle his condition and gentlemen in England now abed shall think themselves accursed they were not here and hold their manhoods cheap while any speaks that fought with us upon Saint Crispin’s day.- King Henry V, Shakespeare 

December 22nd, 1943, 11:30 AM Central European Time Zone

Bastogne, Belgium  

“Hey you see that?” Shepard felt his heart seize up and looked out from the foxhole he’d taken shelter in. He wasn’t even supposed to be here right now but he’d heard that F company still had some ammo left and his own unit was perilously close to becoming unarmed.

“Yeah, there’s four of them.” Someone else said and Shepard peaked out of cover, poking his rifle through the snow and laying eyes on four Germans waking towards his position. One of them was holding a white flag, though Shepard wasn’t about to drop his guard. Taking aim, the soldier watched the krauts move closer, their leather boots crunching in the thick snow.

“I want to see the commanding officer of this section.” One of the Germans announced after arriving directly in front of a soldier holding a BAR pointedly directly at them. The Americans all exchanged glances though nobody moved and silence began to stretch over the group of soldiers.

“Come over here.” A voice cut through the tension and everyone turned to look at Staff Sergeant Dickinson standing on the nearby road. “Shepard, you get what you came for then get back to your company.”

“Yes sir.” Shepard looked over at the Germans then quickly dashed off with the crate of ammo he’d managed to scrounge. It wasn’t much but it meant he’d be able to keep fighting for that much longer.

Reaching his squad, Shepard hoped down into his foxhole and quickly handed out the ammunition before catching his breath. ‘The Germans were delivering a message. I bet they want us to surrender.’ Shepard rubbed his hands together and looked out across the snow covered ground towards the German positions. The area was quiet, like the calm before a storm. ‘They’re going to attack if we don’t.’ Shepard looked around and breathed in deeply, the cold winter air calming his nerves. ‘But they wont shoot us while they’re waiting for an answer.’  

“Well boys, we’ve probably got an hour or two to dig in, the Germans just sent a peace delegation. Thinking we’re going to surrender.” Pulling out an entrenching tool amid a chorus of laughs, Shepard began to deepen his foxhole. Even if it was only making his position a little bit deeper, the firing line a little more protected, it could save his life.

Time passed slowly and Shepard continued his preparations. The attacks on his position were absent and he could hear no signs of the hidden snipers that prowled the lines. Whatever the Germans were up to, they weren’t exposing themselves to the American marksmen in the area. The sound of shovels breaking into frozen ground echoed softly through the snowy trees and Shepard found himself enjoying his methodical work.  

A jeep rumbled by behind Shepard and he turned to see the two German officers sitting in it, being driven back towards F company’s foxholes by Colonel Harper.  The Jeep came to a stop in between Shepard’s group and F company and the Germans stepped out, removing the blindfolds that had been placed over their eyes. Glancing around, Shepard didn’t see a wave of incoming Germans and pulled himself from his foxhole, jogging over to the conversation.

“What is your reply?” One of the Germans asked the Colonel right as Shepard arrived. There were several other members of F company congregating on the area, the curious soldiers all eavesdropping on the conversation that might decide their fate.

“Nuts.” Colonel Harper replied angrily, his eyes drilling into the Germans.

“Nuts? What does that mean, are you surrendering?” Shepard laughed, causing the Germans to realize they were surrounded, though neither seemed worried the Americans would attack them.

“It means you can go to hell.” Harper snapped, daring the Germans to give him a reason to kill them.

“We will kill most of you, if you don’t surrender you’re risking every man under your command!” One of the Germans shouted, shocked that the surrounded soldiers seemed eager to fight. “This is a war! You can surrender if-”

“Listen, we’ll kill every last damn German that comes our way. You send your men, they die, you send more, they’ll die to. Now get out of here before someone mercy kills your kraut ass. And if your commander doesn’t understand the message you can tell him to go to hell too.” Harper smirked as the two Germans turned red with fury and stormed off. “Hey Shepard, quit smiling and get to work. They’re going to pound the hell out of us for this.”

“And we’ll still kill them all.” Shepard replied with a grin, some days it was good to be a paratrooper.

Germany could never have defeated the Soviet Union, let alone the allies. The roads simply did not exist to carry their troops to victory. No amount of tactical brilliance or technological supremacy could save Operation Barbarossa from failure. Unhampered by Stalin’s purges, the Soviets took pressure off the other Allies, allowing the war to come to its logical conclusion that much faster. When the fighting ceases however, a new kind of war would take hold across the planet, for no secret can be kept forever.

___________

Neu Vieumau Port Special Administration District

Vix never got tired of seeing the Ferry Building in the city. So much of her home district was built up around everything old. Old museums, old cultural centers, old habs, and old ruins from the war. But the Ferry Building was a gleaming monument to the new. Of course it was actually constructed before the war, but it was the newest proper building in the city for it and still looked it. Instead of slabs of gray, or concrete, or just the brutalist nature of so many structures this one was silver and glass and green. A giant garden dominated the entire roof of the building providing a flourish of color that any Jipasi could respect. Not to mention just how the interior looked, with the garden influencing a careful balance of shadows and golden rays of light that played off one another even as the wind gently made the trees sway.

Much of the Heights had taken up this same sort of look, integrating as many trees, flowers, and other plants into their architecture as possible. The entire wealthy neighborhood overlooking the port just beyond it on the cliffs which dominated the bay seemed to take on an otherworldly appearance for it. She always thought it was as if the neighborhood was a luxuriant green cloud rising above the grey and the ruin of much of the rest of Neu Vieumau. Considering how many fortifications were still set into the hills and cliffs the Ferry Building provided the best access to the Heights and its private pier. One of the reasons she was sure her brother had come through here before his disappearance. He’d done a number of musical gigs up there in the old days. She loved listening to him regale her of the things he saw up there... 

Of course one could also catch a ferry heading across the bay, or get a connection to a ship in the harbor going… elsewhere. But her brother hadn’t gone elsewhere. He had to be around here somewhere… Just… stuck. Vix felt her shoulders sag a little as she thought about how long she’d been searching for more information about her brother. Raiden always encouraged her but it was… disheartening to think he’d been gone so long and she still couldn’t find what had happened to him. He’d promised her a quick return and plenty of credits. She knew he still had to be working towards that wherever he was. She still had his trumpet tucked under her bed waiting for his return…

“[Vix, you coming?]” Vix jumped a little as the voice brought her out of her headspace. She glanced over at the other ward, a Davari girl by the name of Celuna. “[We’re headed to the mall.]” She nodded to the shopping center that dominated much of the eastern side of the large open square that formed the center of the district.

“[I’ll catch up, I wanted to check out the Ferry Building.]” She pointed.

“[Alright, well you know when the last tram out is, we’ll see you then if not before.]” Celuna waved her off and headed off with the group of other wards they all lived with. They didn’t like to consider themselves orphans, since some of them still had family. Just families that couldn’t, or wouldn’t, take care of them. Which is why they were all wards of the state. It put her in an odd mindset at times. She knew she still had family out there, and she would find him. But she couldn’t prove he was there and so the state took care of her. Which… wasn’t bad. Not when she had Raiden to compare herself against. She still didn’t like it though. At least not the… feeling that the state wanted her to give up on finding her brother.

So for now she steeled herself up, taking a deep breath as she furled and unfurled her tail and then shook herself out from ear to toe, just wiggling and shaking everything. It was a thing her brother had done before big songs and she always felt a sense of relief and comfort wash over her. As if getting her whole body to move in some small way just pumped her blood better. Then she set out, full of determination and energy. There were more people in the square then she ever saw back home. Then again no one really had a reason to visit the joint occupation zone. Unless… they were military police she guessed. But here people were going about their days with a hustle and bustle she’d only seen in vids.

A few Davari in opulent clothes were followed by a trail of servants. Several Ravex in some gaudy outfits that were a cross between armor and robes strode by with purpose. Even some wet, dripping Kra’Kto’Sui ambled by with small bots wheeling behind them humming as they cleaned off the water trails. Then there were even the Quir. Small slug like creatures that had long formed the underclass of noble society on Neu Vieumau, and across most Telurcid territory before the war. Vix knew very little about them. Except they always seemed to be in shockingly good moods for what others might consider an oppressed peoples. 

Based on how they looked she’d always assumed they just sort of… slithered? Slimed? Across the ground. But instead they seemed to scrunch up the back of their lower body and kind of… toss their front section forward and then repeat the process. They were only a bit slower than regular walking pace from what she could tell. They also seemed to have big smiles as if they were having a lot of fun just hurling themselves around the place. Then again, did smiles mean the same thing to them? She sort of took that for granted since humans, Jipasi, and Davari all had similar concepts of smiles. But Kra’Kto’Sui and Ravex didn’t.

Since they’d been subjugated by the Davari did that make them learn how to smile? Vix suddenly had a bunch of new questions about the odd little species but she didn’t have time for that now. Instead she had to keep focusing on weaving her way through the crowds to make it to her goal. There was a break in the crowds though just before the Ferry Building itself. Most people were travelling between the shopping center, the tram station, and the financial district in a triangular pattern.

Once she reached the more open section she could see why. Despite the massive scale of the building it looked like there were only two ways in on this side right now. Both of which were dominated by large security checkpoints. Security checkpoints weren’t anything new for Vix though. Anyone growing up in Neu Vieumau likely knew them intimately. Even as she approached she was already unzipping her mountain fatigue jacket, and folding it up to set into a tray along with her wallet. Then she unlaced her hiking boots just enough to pull them off, balancing herself in a careful squat on one leg to do it, before switching to pull the other off. With her jacket and boots in a tray she could push forward she then handed her student ID over to the nearest soldier.

“Uh, are you authorized?” The question was the first moment she actually looked at the soldiers manning the checkpoint. She’d been through so many over the years she barely processed them anymore. So it was a bit of a surprise to notice they were for some reason wearing desert camo.

“Why wouldn’t I be?” She asked, now as confused as the soldier who’d asked her the question. The man seemed to just blink at this and looked at her ID a moment before shrugging and handing it back. With that she stepped into the scanner and raised her hands up above her head, flaring her tail down wide and low after the first pass without needing to be told.

“Anything in your pockets?” She glanced over at the next soldier, just past the scanner, this one a female.

“No.” She shook her head.

“Okay, step out and hold.” The soldier waved her forward a moment, and then looked just over her shoulder. “Nothing in your pockets?”

“Nothing.” Vix confirmed once more.

“Going to do a brief pat, using just the backs of my hands okay?” The female soldier seemed to ask this, even though it was more a statement of intent because she immediately used the backs of her hands to pat against Vix’ pockets a moment. “Okay, you’re clear.” She waved Vix through then. Vix immediately grabbed her jacket from the tray and pulled it back on, before balancing on one leg yet again to pull her boots on.

“There are chairs.” A soldier mentioned with a point at the end of the little security area.

“I’m fine. Good balance.” Vix mentioned as her tail would furl and unfurl a little behind her to help keep her steady. With her boots back on and tied tight she finally strode forward into the actual Ferry Building, and felt like she was stepping into another world. The cool breeze of the port was replaced with the warmth of the sun as the glass walls helped build up the heat. Just above her was a massive tree with blue leaves, providing shade as the golden rays of sun she always loved spread between the branches and bathed her in a heavenly light.

The noise of the city completely died as the doors behind her closed, and instead she heard faint orchestral music along the sound of running water. An artificial stream ran from a cluster of rocks stacked up between this entrance and the other, and the bubbling water ran towards the bay as if truly feeding into it. The water then diverged into a small delta, with ornamental bridges crossing over them while rainbow fish swam around. Small tables and chairs were set up on the plots of grass and rock making up this tailored delta. Only the edges of the structure seemed to be there to fulfil its true purpose with broad counters for ticket kiosks and signs denoting ticket prices and destinations. The rest was more of this kind of pleasure park, and a few Davari servers in decorative traditional Kiosai uniforms weaved between the tables, serving food from a cafe she spotted to the right.

That’s when the smell of sugary desserts wafted up to fill her nose. She took a moment to just stand there and breath heavily through her snout as the complex smells resolved themselves. One standing high above the rest. “Cinnamon rolls…” The word alone could cause her to salivate, but combined with that smell she was hard pressed to not just rush towards the cafe she was sure the smell originated from.

She did have Raiden’s half a dessert ration coupon code… But cinnamon rolls wouldn’t last well on the tram. Especially if someone tried to snag it from her in the crowds… Maybe she could just have one here… She realized she was biting her lip just thinking about food and her tail had pulled in tight. So she forced herself to relax a moment and think about her actual plan. There used to be jazz bands that played here. Still were even, though right now it was just the piped in orchestral track… Looking around her eyes settled on a small stage nestled among some bushes for a natural alcove. That had to be where they played. But it was empty for now, likely too early. Or maybe the wrong day? She hadn’t been able to find a schedule for live music here.

Who would know? The cafe? Looking around a bit more she noticed the signs leading to the main piers, but the ones headed to the Heights were behind yet another security checkpoint. Which one also had to get through to access the restaurant proper, or the roof garden. She had no idea how much of the structure had been sectioned off over time. Why was it necessary to go through so much security to take a ferry or sit in a garden? The cafe. That was where she’d start.

Striding forward she found that there was no real direct path to the cafe from the entrance. The water paths splitting up the floor into the faux delta made it a much more meandering path. One that conveniently also made her pass by a small market on the way to the cafe. Likely as a tactic to get people to stop and shop. Which partially worked on her as she noticed a few of the things displayed. Meat? Just fresh looking cuts of meat? Not even locked behind display glass? Well… the only way in and out was through security right? So that made more sense. Still she was shocked at just how much meat and produce they seemed to have for sale. Then she saw how much the ration prices were and gasped softly.

“By the great Nomad’s spit…” She muttered to herself. Would someone really pay a week’s ration codes for one basket of apparently organic free range eggs? What did that even mean? She knew the human food staple had rapidly spread across other species for its incredibly versatile protein and fat values but that had made them a common good! Not an exotic delacy like this price would suggest! Then she saw the price for tidal oysters and her eyes got wider still. Maybe for those in the Heights it was just different? Why else spend a month of rations on a single meal's worth of molluscs? Either way she forced herself to move on and actually make it to the cafe now.

The sweet smells of baked goods was mixing in with the rich scent of spiced Ruza cider, the more bitter Vumrix root that the Ravex preferred, and even some hints of the black teas humans preferred. It was near impossible for her to find any Jipasi food… The reputation for being scavenger food was hurtful. And likely perpetrated by people who just didn’t know how to appreciate good scrimp. Or Honeyslush… Or even Bittersweet! Just thinking about it made Vix’s tail fan out in a moment of annoyance before she reigned it in and carefully furled it. No point in marching in with a full flair and scare them off… 

Then again no one could truly appreciate the finer points of Jipasi tail signalling. For all their fearsome appearance Davari had such pitiful little tails… What could they do with them? A little flick or wiggle? Ravex had much more impressive tails of course, but they were muscular things built for strangulation. Or… swiping? Some form of combat. Which was a perversion of tails in a different way considering how drab they were… And humans? She truly felt sorry for them to lack all sense of having tails. And to know they had such close evolutionary cousins that kept them. Did humans envy monkeys? She’d have to ask Raiden.

Focusing once more as she entered the cafe she found the interior to be set up in a circular bar around a central serving station. The chairs were made of wood, and brass while the counters were topped with fine short grass. A few more of the Davari servers were moving in and out, but one was preparing beverages and gathering pastries from the oven set in the middle. The closer she got the more she fought the urge to drool at the scents of all this fresh bread and treats. Focus! 

One of the Davari, a teen likely a few years older than her turned to her but before he could speak Vix set her hands on the grass counter and spoke first. “[Did you work here four years ago?]”

“Wwwoooo…” The Davari made his species version of an uuuhhh sound. “[No?]” He was obviously confused by the question.

“[Does anyone who works here also work here four years ago? That’s in here today. Right now?]” Vix's mind was fluttering a bit as she tried to keep her focus, and translate at the same time.

“Wwwoooo [I don’t… think so? Is something wrong? Did you need to… make a complaint?]” The server was clearly confused.

“[No. Nothing is wrong. Or… not like that. But I just need to find someone who worked here four years ago. And… errr… to make use of… instruments of musical nature.]” She stumbled a little in her Decktongue.

“[You need… a musician? We don’t… hire out bands. We serve drinks and pastries… Would you like one?]” He asked and slowly waved at the pastries behind him.

“[No… yes. Do you know anyone who plays music? Can I talk to a music individual?]” She tried.

“[A musician? I don’t… that’s not my…]” The Davari scratched at his horn. “[Listen esteemed customer. I cannot ask for a manager unless you ask me to ask for one. That might be better?]” He suggested.

“[Yes. But you’re not in punishment.] Eehhhh [Trouble. You’re not in trouble, I just want information. Sorry esteemed employer. Esteemed… individual.]” By now her tail was half curled as she felt entirely flustered with her own performance. She was usually perfectly fluent in Decktongue! But the smell and nerves were messing with her…

“[I shall fetch a manager.]” The Davari nodded to her and pulled back, leaving her to lean against the grass topped counter and clutch her head in her hands. She needed to get herself together. But the thought she might be so close to finding out more about her brother and at the same time be tormented by all these smells was driving her beyond the dune!

Closing her eyes a moment she realized she’d have to embarrass herself a little and she fully furled her tail before tucking it up between her legs and clutched it in her hands, brushing it against her nose. Then she took a few slow, deep breaths, helping filter the scents out and just focus on her own smell. Just a slow deep in… and out. Measure the beat of her heart… Slowly… After doing this for several seconds she released her tail and flicked it back out behind her. It was a childish thing to do but resetting her mind onto her scent greatly helped even her out. She would see the manager and it would all be fine…

An alarm went off. Her eyes snapped open and she looked around. Was it here? Had she been too much trouble? Did they think she was a creep or a criminal or something? A language began to speak out across the building but it was in a language she didn’t know. It was… close to Decktongue but… strange? People began to get up from their tables, some looking worried, others looking annoyed as they began to walk towards the exits. Around her the servers began to hurry this way and that, some grabbing orders to rush out, while others just flat out headed for the exits in a rush.

Then another voice began to speak up, it was one she had no concept of at all. What could it be? What was going on? Now worried she began to head towards the exit as well. The humans who had been guarding the security checkpoint were now inside, making clear waving motions for people inside to head outside and a few were spreading out, guns not exactly raised, but certainly in their hands. When she got closer she saw one point at her. Her heart beat began to race once more. Just keep walking… She hadn’t done anything…

“Hey! Uh… Jipasi… person. Do you eeerr… [Speaken human?]” He asked in heavily accented Decktongue. 

“Do you mean English?” She asked, now confused.

“Uh yeah.” The soldier nodded.

“Why would you even ask me that in Decktongue? But the first part in English?” Was confronting the armed soldier about his own language mistakes really wise?

“Err… yeah well… Listen where are you from?” He asked instead.

“I’m from the cultural ah… The joint occupation zone.” She corrected herself.

“Oh great. Listen, we need some help. See there’s been a bomb threat.” He explained.

“Attention all esteemed shoppers there is currently a priority security incident ongoing. We ask that all those inside the building begin to exit in an orderly fashion.” She looked up as the speakers finally gave a message in English.

“Yeah that.” The soldier said. “Anyway, we need your help like I said.”

“Finding… a bomb?” She was utterly confused.

“No no no.” The soldier shook his head. “We’re… Sarge what are we allowed to tell her?” Vix shifted her attention to the slightly older soldier standing next to him who had been quiet so far.

“Well, first off we weren’t even supposed to tell her about the bomb threat. But you’re doing great specialist. Lets see how deep you can dig this hole.” The first soldier didn’t even seem to be fazed by this and just turned back to Vix.

“We’ve gotten intel reports that Death’s Hand is back and has a bomb somewhere in the city. We’ve narrowed it down to five potential locations, one of which is in the JOZ and we need to drive there so we need your help because we don’t have a map.” The sarge just groaned and set a hand on his face but the specialist smiled at her.

“I’m going to have to NJP your ass into the ground specialist.” The sarge muttered as Vix looked between them with even more confusion.

“Oh no, what am I going to have to do now? Mop the ocean? Dang. Guess I can’t do my job…” The soldier seemed entirely unconcerned with whatever was being threatened.

“You do realize I can just mandate no time off, and forbid you from any secondary tasks right? Did you think about the fact I can NJP you into doing your fucking job and nothing else for the next month asshat? God I hate you’re our best guy…” The sarge grumbled.

“Look, I was brought up for what was supposed to be a single tour because the war was going to shit! One tour! Twelve years later here I am! I want off this fucking bullshit ride!” The apparent specialist tossed his hands up as he complained.


“Do I need to be here for this?” Vix asked which brought their focus back on her.

“Right. Yes. We need your help.” The specialist repeated.

“With… what? You don’t have a map? Of the city? You’re occupying it. How can you not have a map?” She asked, utterly puzzled by their behavior so far.

“We don’t have an updated road map noting which roads are still passable. We’re American Marines, and have been posted around the port because the shitheads in charge figured oh yeah, put marines on the coast, as if that fucking matters right now. And because we’re marines that means we ain’t got shit for logistics. Which includes updated maps. So if you can go with us, we’ll drive and you guide and that’s what we need your help for.” The specialist rambled on a bit but the sarge didn’t add anything so she figured it was really what they wanted.

“What’s in it for me?” She asked as her intrinsic need to haggle began to rise up.

“What? We’re dealing with a bomb threat. Don’t you wanna help your city?” The specialist asked.

“You’re occupiers. I know you’re meaning well, but it doesn’t help me to be seen with you.” She flatley replied. “I’m not saying anything would happen, but why should I help you for free?”

“We’ll be giving you a ride back. Look at the tram station now.” The specialist pointed out the glass walls and she saw that all the people from the nearby shopping district and financial districts were flooding the station to leave the area.

“Yeah well it would take me a few hours to get back anyway.” She shrugged it off, holding her ground in negotiations.

“Right. Well… I have a drink mix.” The specialist offered which made Vix blink and arch a brow in confusion. “Here.” He pulled a small packet from a pocket of his tactical rig and handed it over. Vix slowly took it and turned it over in her hand.

“Drink mix #4 fruit punch?” She slowly rubbed her hand against the package to feel some kind of gritty sand like material inside. “It’s crunchy? I’m supposed to drink this?”

“No, have you never had drink mix? You pour it in water and stir it up.” The specialist explained.

“So I have to already have a drink to make this useful?” She countered.

“Right, you’re Jipasi.” The sarge spoke up and she was about to growl at him to ask what he meant by that when she saw him tug a packet from his rig. “I have bubble-” He didn’t even finish before she snatched the pack of Super Chew from his hand.

“Oh this is the good stuff!” This gum kept its flavor for ages and made big super satisfying bubbles. Her brother used to get it for her when he could but it was hard to find. She paused then realizing she’d destroyed her own negotiating platform and looked back up at the soldiers. “I mean… it’s fine… I guess… I’m also keeping the drink mix.”

“Sure cool, let’s go. This way.” The specialist turned and waved for her to follow them as they headed away from the main stream of people exiting through the security checkpoint and instead headed to the side of the structure. “I’m Tim by the way. Sarge there is Andrés.”

“For fuck’s sake specialist. First Sergeant Ramirez.” The sarge… Ramirez corrected.

“C’mon she’s a civvie.” Tim shrugged it off as he opened a door clearly marked for emergencies and fires only. It claimed to be alarmed but either it had been disabled, or just a lie as him opening it didn’t do a thing. Vix kept following them as they headed outside and the general murmur of activity in the city had picked up with the mass of people heading to the tram station. She could only imagine how annoyed the other wards were for having just gotten to the shopping district only to be forced to leave.

“This is our ride.” Tim announced then as he stopped before a… car? A four wheeled vehicle unlike anything she’d ever seen. It was a squat nearly square vehicle which seemed to consist of little more than four wheels, a frame, and some seats. A big white star had been painted on the hood in contrast with the rest of it being olive drab like her pants.

“What is it?” She asked even as the others hopped in. Tim climbed over the back using the back wheel as a step to hop in while Ramirez took the wheel, leaving Vix the passenger seat.

“It’s a jeep. They were made centuries ago, and since we’re broke we busted them out of a museum.” Tim announced with a big grin.

“Smart ass. It’s a design based on an ancient vehicle of the same name. But obviously it’s modernized. We have no real industrial base anymore since the war cut everything off. These can be made with really basic parts and electric engines which we can procure from local civilian vehicles.” Ramirez explained.

“By which he means we rat fucked every city we could after the end of the war to steal all the parts and engines we could. Yessireee, no working cars in any city the marines liberated.” Vix frowned a bit as she got in the passenger seat and looked around. “No seat belts. No air bags. Your knees are the crumple zone. But hey, it’ll do sixty off road and there’s only a fifty percent chance you’ll be thrown out at those speeds while you hold on for dear life! But we’ve got hundreds of them now so that’s something.”

“You two are not the sort of soldiers I’m used to.” Vix admitted as Ramirez started the vehicle up and started to drive.

“We’re marines Miss. You’re from the JOZ? So you’re used to Rimjobs and Vuckers. We are a different breed entirely.” Tim explained.

“Rimjobs? Vuckers?” She looked over at the sergeant who just sighed.

“He is referring to the Void military, and the Reformed Imperial Military. I promise you Miss we’re not all complete degenerates like Specialist Taylor here.” He shook his head slightly as he began to drive through the edge of the square to get to the road. While people were still crossing over to get to the tram station he didn’t exactly stop, but he didn’t really speed up. Just kept an even speed which made the pedestrians move ahead of him so they didn’t get run over. Pretty typical for Neu Vieumau traffic.

“That’s right! Tim Taylor! TT! Sounds like Titty. I’ve heard all the jokes.” Vix glanced back as the specialist leaned back a bit, spreading out in the back seats of the vehicle.

“So, where are we going?” She asked, realizing she should probably do what they needed her to do.

“We are looking for the old cultural building.” Tim replied.

“Which old cultural building? There are a lot.” Vix mentioned.

“The uh…” Tim began to pat his rig until he pulled out a small scrap of paper. “The old cultural exchange building. That’s all it says.”

Vix had to think a little before realizing they probably meant the one actually right near her building. “Oh. I think I know what one you want.” Then she looked at Ramirez. “You’ll want to stay on this road for three blocks, then a right around the crater. Then take the hill.” He nodded and focused on his driving. Unlike the JOZ civilians in this district actually still had their own cars. It was a bit unusual for her to see non military vehicles driving around since she was so used to it just being big armored trucks and the like.

“So, how’s life in the JOZ? The vuckers treating you well?” Tim asked as they drove.

“They’re fine. Better than the uh… Rimjobs.” She wasn’t exactly sure what the word meant but she could tell it was belittling the Davari militia and she was fine with that… All those random searches and pat downs… Women were careful around those degenerates. It did help that she always wore such bulky clothes like her surplus fatigues, but it still should never happen.

“Cool cool. What were you doing in the Ferry Building? I can’t imagine getting an authorized day pass was easy.” When he said that she blinked. Is that what the soldier earlier had been asking about?

“I uh… Am trying to find my missing brother.” She answered honestly.

“He’s missing? Did you file a missing person’s report? How long has he been missing?” Ramirez immediately took her seriously it seemed.

“Yes, and he’s been missing for four years.” She replied.

“Four years?” Tim sounded a bit surprised. “Have you heard anything?” 

“Not yet. He was last seen in the ferry building. I was… asking around.” She crossed her arms then feeling a bit… apprehensive about the sudden questioning.

“Just… literally asking around? You’d probably be better off making an appointment with the security staff. I think they keep passenger logs.” Tim mentioned. “What about your parents? Why did you go alone?”

“My parents are dead.” She had long since lost the sting of mentioning that to people. It could only hurt so much before she grew an emotional callus to that wound.

“Oh… So you’re…” Tim trailed off.

“A ward of the state. I live in one of the youth barracks.” She nodded.

“Sorry.” Tim muttered and the ride settled into an awkward silence while Ramirez drove on. He turned at the big crater at the base of Opulent hill, and start to drive up through the ruins of the old Hive complex. The buildings had been reduced to rubble, but a dirt road had been formed from years of first military vehicles driving the area since it was the most direct path between the port and city center.

“Where from here?” Ramirez finally asked to break the silence.

“Left at the spike.” She nodded at a large metal sculpture that had been twisted and wrecked in the war, leaving what looked to be nothing more than a giant metal spike in the ground. As he turned they had a nice view from the hill looking down over the city center. Most of it was dominated by the cultural district but she could still see City Hall in the distance. “Then right at the bottom and you’ll have to see if the ditch is flooded or not.”

The vehicle descended the hill a bit faster than she expected, but she enjoyed the brief sensation of speed and wind whipping at her hair. The streets at the bottom weren’t dirt but were partially ruined still, since no one had gotten around to patching them yet. Then they came to a stop before a big ditch between some blown out buildings. There was some water, but not too deep. “You should be fine.” She nodded and Ramirez pressed on, driving down into the ditch and up the other side as the vehicle seemed to handle it just fine.

“Okay… Left, then the second exit in the traffic circle.” She kept guiding them as they drove on finally returning to actually proper roads.

“Wouldn’t it be faster to take the first exit?” Ramirez asked.

“And go through the Ravex occupation zone? Oh… uh…” Vix glanced around a moment, reminded she was driving with soldiers. “Yeah I guess. I just… don’t go there. They don’t have a friendly reputation around here.”

“Do they have a friendly reputation anywhere?” Tim asked.

“I guess not. Did you need to meet up with them? Or other military people to check out this building?” She asked while they neared the Ravex zone. It had been the industrial portion of the city. Such as Neu Vieumau, a city of parties and museums had one.

“We’re just supposed to check out the building. Fuckwits in command sent the two of us so you can imagine how important they think this is.” Tim snorted. “Everyone else is being diverted to the possible threats in the port and financial districts. Some abandoned building in the JOZ? I mean they have to send someone but no one important.”

“We allerted the Void military to the possibility. They say the building has been cleared, and we’ve been sent to double check.” Ramirez explained. Just ahead was the checkpoint to the edge of the Ravex occupied zone. A group of human soldiers, Americans she had to guess were on this side, and the Ravex were on the other.

“Wait, if you guys have a checkpoint here how did you not know how to get to it?” She asked.

“Listen lady I just work here alright?” Tim immediately answered from the back.

“It might surprise you to learn this but we do in fact have some maps. It’s just that no one gave me any.” Ramirez revealed.

“And translators on the battalion level! Joy.” Tim added, which took a moment to filter through Vix’s mind.

“Wait. Do you mean you don’t have people who speak Decktongue in your patrols?” She looked back at Tim.

“Kinda. We do, but not official. We’ve had to rely on individual marines learning what they can of the local language and… Lets just say having professional translators makes a big difference. It’s more we only have a precious few people who can speak… Whatever Ravex speak. Not to mention Divine, or Russian for fuck’s sake. Damn slavs.” Tim shook his head and let out a heavy sigh.

“Divine?” Vix asked, unsure about that one.

“Yeah. The language the fancy lad Davari speak, up on their rich bitch cliff. And… churches too and stuff.” Tim shrugged. “You don’t know it?”

“No.” She shook her head slowly. “Just Decktongue. I’m not Davari, I don’t go to the Swagin Church.”

“Well, none of that matters right now because we’re gonna get growled at.” Tim muttered as they neared the checkpoint. The marines on the close side lifted the gate as they approached but the Ravex standing around didn’t move yet. The war had been over for eight years and still they held the position as if expecting an assault. Heavy barricades were set up around a heavily armored tractor to use as a gate of sorts. The buildings on the Ravex side also had nests up top, with armed soldiers watching them from above.

“Papers.” A heavily armored Ravex demanded as he stepped up to Ramirez.

“You kidding me?” Ramirez asked, but the hulking soldier’s tail just gave an annoyed whip behind him.

“Papers.” He repeated. Ramirez shifted and pulled a small card from his rig to hand over. The Ravex glanced at Vix. “All papers.”

“No. You just need mine. Scan it.” Ramirez growled back. The Ravex didn’t reply at first but pulled the card back and held up a tablet to scan it across. “We’re just passing through to the JOZ. That’s it. No stops.”

“No schedule. Make appointment.” The Ravex replied.

“No, fuck that. Open the gate. We’re pursuing an imminent threat. It’s been cleared. Scan it.” Ramirez growled. The Ravex took in a deep breath, towering over them even sitting in the jeep. Then after a moment it handed the card back and waved a hand as the tractor began to move.

“Follow bike.” The guard announced and waved them past.

“Bike?” Ramirez asked before they heard the throaty rumble of an engine. Just up the street they saw a massive motorcycle turn the corner and wait for them. A Ravex in sleak matt black armor was stradling it and it seemed to have a series of tubes clustered all along the back.

“Ooohhh a fucking rocket bike! I’m watching a werewolf lizard riding a legit rocket bike! So fucking cool.” Tim muttered behind Vix.

“Follow.” The guard announced once more.

“Yeah.” Ramirez agreed and waved him off as they drove ahead. The moment they were past the tractor it began to rumble back into place. The bike up ahead let out a roaring engine rev before taking a lead position.

“What… is the point of that vehicle?” Vix asked with a frown.

“Hit and run. Those massive wheels are for use in tons of terrain you wouldn’t expect. They were used to dash in, fire a bunch of rockets at Hive mobile hubs and then just fuck off. Totally useless in an urban environment like this but fuck do they look cool.” Tim explained as they began to follow it through the streets. Vix noted how many buildings in the district seemed to have Ravex posts up on top of them. But the few factories the city had were more important than ever since the war had cut them off from the greater galaxy, so the Ravex were likely taking any measures they needed to keep them operational.

Though as she looked up at the buildings she saw just the burnt top of a tower in the distance. “That explosion last week, was that Death’s Hand? Like you think the threat now is?”

“No.” Tim shook his head. “Some people think that was a mistake, not enough explosive to knock the whole tower down but that’s just not right. They meant to only take the top off. Why? No idea. But that was a very good, very specific explosive. Not Death’s Hand style at all. They want mass casualties.”

“So… why then would they want to blow up the abandoned cultural exchange building?” Vix asked.

“Not a clue. But we have an intel report so we’re checking it out.” Tim shrugged.

“You know since we’re getting a Ravex escort I’m not even sure we needed your help at all. The gum might be too high a price.” Ramirez mentioned.

“Too bad, cause it’s already mine now.” Vix grinned. The bike ahead of them just keep speeding up, seeming to test Ramirez and the jeep. Considering the otherwise totally empty streets she figured the driver just wanted to race, but she didn’t mind as the faster they drove the more fun she had but it also meant she was soon clutching the side of the jeep for support to not slide out of her seat as Ramirez rose fo the challenge and sped up to keep pace.

“Bump!” Ramirez shouted just as he saw a dip in the road just before they hit it. Vix felt her body rise up out of her seat a moment and her tail fanned out as if to start flapping before the jeep landed on the other side and she bounced back down into her seat hard. She couldn’t help but laugh though and let out thrill seeker’s cry as her call echoed out across the buildings around them.

“Fuck! I forgot you guys can make sounds like that.” Tim called out over the sound of the wind and the racing Ravex engine ahead of them.

“Gotta get us excited is all!” Vix called back.

“I think I’m managing!” Ramirez was gripping the wheel tight, focused on not losing the bike as it kept whipping around corners and no doubt breaking the Ravex’s own speed limits in the district. But before she realized it they were slowing down and the bike pulled off to the side. The rider leaned up and gave a wave as Vix and the others all waved back. Then Ramirez had to come to a stop before another security checkpoint.

“Are we through already?” Vix gasped.

“Record time I guess. Who knew the werewolf lizards could have fun?” Tim chuckled as they waited for another armored tractor much like the first to roll out of the way. As Ramirez drove forward at a much more appropriate pace for the city she saw the Cathedral up ahead and realized they were close to the building. Though, they suddenly came to a stop just as a human began to run out into the road ahead of them. A human who stopped when he saw them.

“Vix?” Vix blinked as she realized who was in the street.

“Raiden?” He was wearing a backpack she’d never seen and… nice boots.

“Hey! What are you doing back?” He ran over to the side of the jeep to talk to her. “Are you in trouble?” He glanced at the soldiers.

Chapter 2: An Old Friend

&amp;#x200B;

After spending nearly the whole night thinking about all that he lost, the last thing he expected to hear was the voice of a Shil’vati marine behind him. When he looked back at the two, he had only recognized one of them, at least immediately. He was only two shots of liquor in, far from being drunk. His half Irish ancestry required far more alcohol to get shitfaced. The first Shil’vati he recognized was Captain Mal’Ava, the same officer who had saved him from being executed all those years ago. It was funny actually, a whole year after the war, she actually sought him out, wanting to learn more about him, and why he did what he did. Hell, she even took the time to learn English, just as he learned Shil’vati.

She was the only Shil’vati he had any positive feelings or opinions about. They both talked on and off over the years, usually when she had opportunities for leave. Otherwise she was busy across Earth’s numerous red zones. The second Shil’vati that was with her however, he didn’t know who she was, but deep inside, a creeping suspicion began to rise.

“Its been awhile since you’ve stopped by Mal’Ava,” he said throwing back his third shot, passing the glass back to the bartender, and waved off her attempt to refill his glass. “So what brings you around these parts, and who’s your friend.” he said as he completely shifted himself to face them.

“I’m surprised you don’t recognize me,” the Shil’vati with the robotic arm said, waving it around emphatically. It took a few seconds for it to sink in, but soon Zachary realized exactly who this was, and his eyes widened at the realization. “I’ll take it, you just remembered.” she said with a grin.

“No fucking way!” Zachary said as he looked at the purple skinned amazon, staring with curiosity as to why she was here. “So what brings you all the way over here? Coming back for revenge after all these years?” he asked, causing the tall girl to frown.

“Why would I do that? She asked, cocking her head off to the side. “I don’t hold this against you, especially since you're the only reason I’m still alive.”

“It's funny, because your captain here is the only reason I’m alive,” he said, glancing back at her. “Otherwise your comrades would have shot my ass dead, and left me to rot on Okinawa. Sometimes I wonder if it’d be better that way. Lord knows so many people view me as a traitor for saving your life instead of taking it.”

Unbeknownst to Zachary at the time, the helmet he removed from the Shil’vati marine had a built in camera. A camera that caught the entire exchange, up to the point where he applied his tourniquet to her arm, and surrendered to the Shil’vati reinforcements that arrived. They released this video for propaganda purposes. They labelled it as an act of honor, showing that humans could become valuable Imperial Citizens, even if they once took up arms against them. But many Americans, and indeed many people around the world, called him a coward and a traitor for not killing her. There were many that argued what he did was morally justified, rather than murdering a defenceless soldier.

He remembered as much when he, as well as other American soldiers stationed in the Pacific, were sent back home, a defeated army who lost much, and gained nothing. Some reception was fairly warm, with many people grateful to see their own alive again. Others were hostile, especially to Zachary, since the video involving him with that Shil’vati marine joined the top 10 trending videos of the war. As he got off the plane at Los Angeles International, he became a target for angry civilians who believed he did the wrong thing.

“You're a goddamn coward!” one woman yelled at him. Zachary responded simply by flipping her off, which enraged her even more, including her husband. The man rushed towards him, screaming and spitting in his face.

“Lousy liberal piece of sh-” he cut the man off by cocking back his right arm, and delivering a punch strong enough that sent the fat man tumbling down.

“YOU WEREN’T THERE GOD DAMMIT!” he screamed down at the man holding his jaw, his southern accent leaking out more and more in anger. “You weren’t there like I was! We didn’t stand a fucking chance against them! What would killing a defenseless soldier have done in the long run, huh? Jack fucking all is what it would’ve done!” as the man started to get up, he noticed there were more behind him, coming steadily closer. He counted 6 more of them, all with angry expressions on their faces, staring directly at him. He balled his fists, waiting for whatever was coming to happen, but he was reminded he wasn’t alone.

“You really want to ride this train?” he heard a familiar voice say. Off to his left, one of his buddies, a 6’5 friend of his, called Serphy, stood tall over them. He stared the would-be attackers down, daring them to try anything. Along with him, more of his fellow marines, Fernandez, Perez, Levine, Jones, Macias, and Vincente, all stood alongside him. All of them graduated from the same company, and all stood shoulder to shoulder.

“You guys were acting tough a second ago,” Fernandez said, giving a death glare at the men. “You have no idea what we fought over there, so you’ve got some fucking nerve messing with one of our own.” he finished, waiting to see if any of them would make a move. They didn’t and slowly but surely, they sulked back into the crowd, and the marines made their way towards baggage, and to the meeting area.

“Thanks guys, I appreciate it.” he said they walked down to the pickup area.

“We all went through the same shit man, there’s no way we were leaving you alone to those assholes,” Perez said. “Besides, you gave us the time we needed to haul ass out of there. We honestly thought you were dead until we saw you at Kadena.”

“Despite all of this shit, we’re still marines, and we’re still brothers until the day we die.” Macias said. It helped Zachary feel a bit better, knowing that he still had his brothers by his side. It would be even better when they could meet their friends and family who awaited them here at the airport. Once they reached the pickup area, all his fellow marines made their way to their loved ones, leaving Zachary by himself. He did see a sign being held up that had his name on it though, behind it more than a few of his old high school friends.

“Its so good to see you, Cameron!” he said as he embraced his old friend in a hug. The man stood a few inches taller than Zachary, and played on the football team, so he was a fair bit bigger than him. He reciprocated the same actions with his other friends who had arrived, no matter how it looked to everyone else.

“You have no idea how glad we are to see your alive bro!” his friend, Bailey said. “When we heard about Okinawa, we were worried, but then we saw the video.” the smile across Zachary’s face disappeared at the mention of that, and he began to worry about what they thought of it.

“You guys gonna give me shit about not being a cold blooded killer too? Or try and jump me like those redneck assholes at the arrival area did?” he said, a sad expression written across his face. His friends exchanged some worried and confused glances, before one of them replied back.

“Why the hell would we do that?” another friend, Jae, asked him. “You made it out alive, against these invaders? Why the hell would we do that?”

“Have you seen the youtube comments on that video, Jae?” Cameron asked. “People have been screaming about him being a race traitor and a coward for what he did.”

“Well I got a very warm welcome as I got off the plane, I’ll say that much,” Zachary said, looking around as if he was expecting someone else. He saw his fellow marines, as well as other servicemen, with their families, but he didn’t see his own. “Is my mother late or something? Where is she? Hell, where is my brother?” Cameron bit his lower lip, as others around him changed the expressions on their faces, telling him that something was wrong.

“I don’t think they heard about what happened,” his friend Elijah said. A look of sorrow in his eyes as he looked at Zachary. “I’m so sorry man, but they aren’t coming.” he said, his voice cracking slowly. The already pale marine went even paler, his eyes widening as the realization sunk in, and tears filled his eyes.

“N-no,” he said as his voice cracked apart. “Please no. Please god don’t do this. They’re all I’ve got left!” he said collapsing to his knees, sobbing uncontrollably as his friends did their best to console him. The marine cursing the heavens over the loss of his family. Asking for himself to be taken rather than them.

“Fuck these alien bastards!” Cameron said, doing his best to console his friend.

The memories of that day came flooding back intensely thanks to the alcohol in his system, and he did his damndest to keep them down.

“So do you regret saving my life?” the Shil’vati asked, genuinely curious.

“Not one damn bit,” he replied. “You didn’t deserve to be killed like an animal like so many people believed I should’ve done to you. Even after all these years of believing myself a failure, being called a traitor by my own people, part of me wishes I never came back at all. Besides, killing you wouldn’t have brought back all those I lost.”

“You shouldn’t feel ashamed over what happened all those years ago.” she said. “You fought better than most did, and you fought bravely, not to mention honorably.” She finished, putting her metallic hand on his shoulder, the cold of it causing him to shiver.

“Honor? You talk about honor as if you conducted your invasion with any,” he said, glaring at the Shil’vati. “You came here with no warning, no demands of surrender, just bombarding thousands of locations around the world, killing millions of men, women, and children. People who never had a hope in hell against what you brought against them.”

“But we-” she tried to reply, only for Zachary to stand up, and wave her off.

“There’s a multitude of ways you could’ve gone about what you did. You could’ve sat in orbit, bombed some minor countries that barely anyone cared about, and hit every nuclear silo with impunity. Hell, even the ones we managed to launch didn’t do a damn thing. You never gave anyone a chance to properly surrender, you just barged right in, killed who you wanted to, and expected us to roll over. Now you wonder why this planet is still mostly hostile to you after all these years, why resistance in many regions is still the same as it was from day fucking one.”

“The way we invaded your planet was the same way we had done all others in the Imperium,” Mal’Ava said. “It was the most tactically sound approach there was, considering your technological advancement, and militarization. There was no other way to have inducted your planet into the Imperium.'' The last part made Zachary close his eyes and breathe in slowly, doing his best to hold back his irritation, something both Shil’vati noticed, but said nothing about.

“I’m guessing the concept of diplomacy isn’t known to you people, is it? Let me go ahead and try to explain this. You came here with technology well in advance of anything we could make, and only knew of in science fiction. Your entire race is considered fucking beautiful to most humans, including your men if I do say so myself, have an extreme gender imbalance, and are just as horny as any one of my marine brothers. You have the capability to casually travel throughout the stars, something most of us dreamed of doing when we were little kids, but realized would never happen. You have weapons that make Stormtroopers from Star Wars look like toy soldiers in comparison, and are waging war against some species of bug out there in space.""

“Do you know how many millions of men and women both would’ve gladly joined your ranks if you’d simply opened talks with us, instead of attacking us? The opportunities your empire offers would’ve interested so many of us, that you could’ve had millions of soldiers serving your empress without ever firing a shot. Hell, I would’ve gladly signed up if it meant hanging around horny space amazons and fighting giant cockroaches. But the way you went about business, the millions who would have gladly served you, actively hate you and resist you whenever possible.”

“I’m not saying I disagree with some of what you say, but it was calculated that your governments wouldn’t have willingly joined our Imperium without force of arms, and it was decided from there.” Mal”ava argued. “You already know that I don’t agree completely with this war, and neither does Sergeant Kolani either. We know full well that mistakes have been made, but the measures taken are the ones that have worked for us in the past, and I doubt they’ll change.”

“Even giving all of us who served a special symbol and serial number on our Imperium ID’s to keep track of us with? Is that something you’ve always done?”

“On the scale your planet was militarized, it was deemed necessary to keep track of those who might take part in future resistance, and lower the chances of sabotage.” Zachary just sighed at that answer.

“Yeah, it's not the first time people like me were marked with a symbol and serial number to show that they were different. That we’re a threat to the government. And you wonder why so many people hate you, especially in Israel.” he said with bitterness in his voice, and a visible redness to his eyes. “A certain historical regime would’ve been fucking proud of what you’ve done.

“I was stationed in that region, and I became aware of the history regarding it.” Mal’Ava said, with notable agitation in her voice. “The events you refer to are ones I’m aware of as well, and find absolutely disgusting, as do most Shil’vati with even a halfway decent sense of morality.”

“Right, and you wonder why that region is the most dangerous to your people, why everyone gives you the cold shoulder at best, and shoots you at worst. Why after what happened in Rome, Mecca, and Jerusalem, the vast majority of the world’s religious population hates you.” he finished, crossing his arms. “But putting aside all this, what are you even doing here? I doubt you travelled halfway around this planet just to check up on my welfare. I'm guessing you don't have many of your own men around where you're stationed, am I right? And the locals won't pay you the time of day? Just like last time you stopped by, eh?” he said, a smirk growing across his face.

“Captain?” Sergeant Kolani said, turning to her Captain, who was blushing bright blue. Zachary only chuckled at her reaction.

“I’m guessing she never told you, did she? I’m surprised, especially since your guys tend to lack in the way of stamina. I honestly feel bad for them.” he said, chuckling again. “Maybe that’s why she brought you along too, show you what you're missing.” This time, Kolani blushed blue, amusing Zachary even more. For how much he hated the Shil’vati for what they did to his life, he didn’t hate Mal’Ava, and had no reason to treat Kolani like shit either. He didn’t mind having some fun at their expense, and watch them flail around a little. He did enjoy teasing them about the subject of sex, given how their gender imbalance is, and apparently how many women in their society could go their whole lives without ever having sex.

“That’s not why I’m here,” she squeaked out. “Not entirely anyway, but I was looking to talk to you about something you might be interested in, and some people who think like me.”

“The series of events that allowed for us to become friends is absent with any other of your people. Granted I’m talking to Sergeant Kolani here, but those circumstances aren’t normal either. Why do you think I want to talk to any other Shil’vati for any reason?”

“Because like I said, they think like me, sick of these useless wars, and have recently gotten out of this world’s red zones. Perhaps you could help us shed some light on some problems that we still don’t understand. And as I said before, I have that, based on your background, might interest you.”

“And just what might interest me?”

“The Imperium is getting ready to start accepting humans into military service, and I wanted to recruit you.”",/r/HFY/comments/l9gljw/semper_shilvati_an_ssbverse_story_chapter_2/,57
17,lbdo7h,HFY,Wed Feb  3 04:47:54 2021,I want your opinion!,"Hello, I started to wirte a LitRPG story and whould like your opinions on these two chapters.

It´s a System Apokalypse story inspired by writers like Tao Wong and Stuart Grosse.

I know, there are likly still a lot of errors in it. Sorry english is not my first language.

P.s.: I had some format problems after copying it here sorry.

Edit: format and hopefully most errors.

 		**Chapter 1**   


I was more than happy today. As I dived through the open bottom of the diving bell I took two happy thoughts with me. First, I had three months without tourists in front of me. No Karens, Kevins or other assholes that made my life a hell. Secondly, the next three months could bring me closer to my dream to study marine biology. Since I was a little boy, I wanted nothing other. And so, after I finished school in Germany, I took a leap of faith and went as Au Pair to Australia. I had planned to take the time there to make connections and find a job that let me stay there, save enough money and get the right experience to be allowed in the right university. And I really lucked out. The niece of the mother of the family I did my Au Pair, happens to be Samantha Richards, Captain and owner of the Deep Dive. She took me in as ship hand and diver and now, nearly three years later, I have not only a job, growing savings and most diving certificates you can have, I’m also along on this ride.   


„Everything ok Mark? Over“ Sam voice came out of the speaker of the bells control board.   


„Yes Capt´. I’m ready for my 10 hours with the fish. Over.“   


„Ok. I give the mic to the professor now. Send us good pictures. Over“   


„Aye, Aye! Over.“   


The bell was sinking slowly to the seafloor. 65 meters already down. Half there. Today, and the next three to four days, we would simply drive up the ridge of the Britannia and Queensland Guyot, and he would film with a remote controlled camera whatever the Prof wanted. It was simply to find the perfect spots for about 100 little cameras and sensor packets. The installation and servicing of these cameras was a huge part of the contract Sam had with the University. And if I could impress the Professor, I might get a letter of recommendation out of it.   


Two hours later, still south of the highest peak of the Britannia Guyot about 240 km southeast of Brisbane, things were going well. The Prof was easy to work with, and had even asked my opinion one time, as something was happening.   From one second to another all fish dodged into hiding. I just wanted to get a look around with the camera, when suddenly the diving bell got a hard pull to the side and collided with part of the Guyot. The next I knew was the sound of metal hard under strain and on the monitor I could see the cable that should connect me to the ship coming down.     


FUCK!“ I swore while rubbing my head where I hit it on the side of the bell. What had happened? Did the ship gone on full drive. Fuck! I must have hit my head harder than I thought, the surrounding space seamed to blur and get bluish tint, and …...     


Greetings sentient beings in the influence sphere of Star \[ $&amp;%/($“&amp;%&amp;%\],

you are now in reach of the \[UNIVERSESYSTEM\] please wait until all lifeforms,

matter and energy is analyzed by the \[SYSTEM\]. While the analysis and the 

subsequent protocols are ongoing all lifeforms are in stasis. 

	Don’t Panic!

&amp;#x200B;

What the hell? I wanted to swear again, but I couldn’t. I couldn’t even move or breathe. It took some time until I could fight down the panic. There I was. Sitting in a blue glow and these words are directly in front of me and had the impudence to tell me not to panic. Even without this System or whatever I had really enough reason to panic. I sat in a diving bell on the seafloor, 120 meters deep, with air for a little more than 10 hours and no clue what happened to the ship. Hell, this was the perfect time for panic. But I could do nothing but stare at the words in front of me.   


Analysis completed.

You and everything in the sphere of influence of your star is now fully connected to

the \[UNIVERSESYSTEM\]. 

Because of the high amount of sentient beings on the third planet of your star,

part of these being will get a random race change for diversity. Who is affected 

is random and the kind of races is determinate by the locale \[Field of Folklore\].

Beings that get affected by this are entitled to a \[Boon\] from the \[System\].

&amp;#x200B;

Attention being \[Markus Grinsjki\]! You are in a high risk area, defined by the 

\[System\] as an area with less than 100 sentient in the perimeter of 100 SU3

\[SystemuntitTier3\], that entitles you to a \[Large Boon\].

&amp;#x200B;

Attention being \[Markus Grinsjki\]! The process of connection to the

\[UNIVERSESYSTEM\] left you in a situation that will end in your death with a 

probability of 98%, that entitles you to a \[Major Boon\].

&amp;#x200B;

Start now by selecting

\[Large Boon\]

\[Mayor Boon\]

\[Class\]

&amp;#x200B;

Selections that are not done in the next 40 STU \[SystemTimeUnit\] will be made by 

the \[System\].

(One rotation of your Planet on his own axis are 309 STU)

&amp;#x200B;

Well this \[System\] agrees that I’m fucked. But it seems to want to give me something. Hopefully something that can get me out of this trouble. And I got about three hours to select it. But what does it mean with select a \[Class\]?   


Select a \[Class\]

&amp;#x200B;

Warrior +

Fighter +

Ranger +

Rogue +

Mage +

Divine Professions +

Crafter +

Social Professions +

&amp;#x200B;

Wait! Wait! Full back! The words got back to the last message. What was this? A Video game? The world seemed to gotten really strange. And there was Mage as an option. Real magic? I really tried to think clear and to not panic.   First I needed a way to get out of this predicament. If I didn’t find a way to survive, nothing other would matter. Perhaps he could find something lifesaving in this Boon thingie.   


Select \[Large Boon\] or \[Major Boon\] ?

&amp;#x200B;

Hey this, whatever it is, reacts to my thoughts. Let's look at the \[Large\] one first. Major sounded way bigger, and I knew I would bite myself in the ass, if I found later that there would have been a cheaper option. And there were a lot of options. As I worked through the menu I couldn’t believe my eyes. Weapons, armor, artifacts, powers, hell even vehicles and buildings. But only two options that could save me. \[Race change – Based on own field of folklore\]   


Yes there were options that get me out of his dilemma. But only if he wanted to stay underwater or would be ok with transforming into an absolute monster. The other option was simply a one time teleport to a \[Systemcentre\] of my choice. There was a world map, and it showed, that, whatever this \[Systemcentre\] was, I could teleport nearly everywhere I wanted. The problem was, after seeing what I could get for his \[Large Boon\] I was simply too greedy to spend it on a one time thing. Not if there is another way. So I better have a look at this \[Major Boon\] and do it fast. Time is ticking, and it’s really hard to judge time here.   


0:0029:3211

&amp;#x200B;

Nice! Just thinking about the time left gave me a countdown. So lets go. \[Major Boon\]!   


Again a huge list of possibilities. Looks to be more or less the same as before, just more powerful and better. And the option for a change of race is there to. But now it’s \[Race change – races of star systems up to 10 SLY \[Systemlightyears\] away\]. I have no idea how far a Systemlightyear is, but there are more races listed, than I could check in a day. So no time to lose, lets see how good this system reacts to me. “Show me all amphibious and mostly humanoid races, that can survive the water pressure outside and in the air on land.” Aaaand, the list is cut down to 9. The first six are not really worth thinking about. The only humanoid feature they have are arms and legs, kind of. I rather take the teleport before living in such a grotesque body. Number seven is, lets call it a sea elf with a frog in his close ancestry. And number eight is ....... “Holy Cthulhu”   


Craquton

&amp;#x200B;

Tier II variant of the \[Lesser Craquton\]. 

Origin: Fernessi IV. The Craqutons are Demonoide that were created by the \[True Creator Biomancer\] Ward´frugh by combining Quarstars, an octopoide species of Fernessi IV and Demons. 

From the Quarstars they retain their octopoide build, two arms and two legs of the Demon and four tentacles like the Quarstar, and the ability to change the coloring of their skin. The influence of the Demon in this creation seems to add the sentience and the ability for \[Mindmagic\]. The Tier II variant has further the ability for \[Illusionsmagic\].

&amp;#x200B;

Starting Attributes: 

Strength: 15 		Constitution: 15 	Agility: 15 	Dexterity: 15

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, there were more information, but short this guy had not only better Attributes than I would have naturally. I did a quick check with the system, and mine were between 8 and 12. Got 1AP more per Level than a human and could survive a little more than 150 meters deep only with the stater values. The pictures I got of this guys looked much better than the description sounded. The Torso was wider than that of a human and the teeth clearly said “I’m not a vegan”. Ok the three horns, that lay close to his bald skull, and the tentacles you might need to getting used to, but overall ...... Oh, who am I kidding! And by the way, what I couldn’t hide under some kind of coat, there was Illusionsmagic, or not. To be true I only try to convince myself and option number nine is just the \[Lesser Craquton\]. I take it. System lock this in. Race change to Craquton for my \[Major Boon\]     


\[Major Boon\] selected.

Select \[Large Boon\] and \[Class\]

Time 0:0021:4222

&amp;#x200B;

Ok! Time flies if you are busy. So what's next? Better first selecting a \[Class\], so I can get a sensible clue what a good choice for the other Boon is.   


Select a \[Class\]

Warrior +

Fighter +

Ranger +

Rogue +

Mage +

Divine Professions +

Crafter +

Social Professions +

&amp;#x200B;

Mage!!!! Of course Mage! I don’t be a meathead warrior when there is magic.   And there is a long list again. A lot of different kinds of mages. There are the standards of course like the \[Elementarist\] and his specializations that have only one element but are much more powerful with it. After much “scrolling”, I find the simple: Rare +     
At the bottom of the List.   


Rare \[Classes\]

&amp;#x200B;

Through your innate traits you have following Rare options.

DarkCultist

Mindflayer

Biomancer

&amp;#x200B;

Biomancer

&amp;#x200B;

As your race is the product of the art of biomancy you have the opportunity to select this rare Class.

A Biomancers strength lies in the wielding of \[Lifemagic\] as a magical \[Crafter\]. If he has the time, concentration and tools, there is no other \[Healer\] that comes close to him. But he not only excels at the repair of lifeforms, his real trade is to alter them.

In the face of combat he is still able to heal, but not as other specialized \[Lifemagic\] users or \[Divine Healer\]. Like most \[Healer\] his few atackspells are low power, unless used against the \[Undead\]

&amp;#x200B;

Abilities:

\[Lifemagic\], \[Assess Lifeforms\], \[Scan Lifeforms\], \[Alter Lifeforms\]

&amp;#x200B;

Skills:

Identify, 

&amp;#x200B;

Spells:

Intelligence/3 spells at start.

&amp;#x200B;

Intelligence +1 and Wisdom +1 / Level

&amp;#x200B;

That really sounded interesting. I looked at this class first, simply because one of them was able to create a whole new race. But this may be really something different.   I mean, in a game, it was always fun to play the damage dealing lightning throwing Mage, or the pure healer that keeps the group alive. But this is my real life. Of course only if I didn’t lose my mind when I hit my head and just hallucinate all of this. Secondly, the other two rare classes didn’t really speak to me.   The DarkCultist seemed to be some kind of pet class with summoned demons, and about the Mindflayer.... Let's say I simply don’t want to do even half the things they are able to. I never played a crafter in games, but a healer magical crafter mix. Sign me in. I select \[Biomancer\].

Neet! This system actually gives me a character sheet. Let's see, how to move forward? Hah! Whom am I kidding? Naturally I have to select my spells. The only other option is the other Boon that's still open. But I checked them out earlier and think that I have a pretty good idea what I take. But first, how much time have I left?   


0:0009:5677

So still a little more than 45 minutes. So select Spells!   


\[Lifemagic\] + 

\[Mindmagic\] +

\[Illusionsmagic\] +

So another long list. 25 so called \[Novice spells\] for each kind of magic I have access to. And I can choose 5. I mean the first one is an absolute no-brainer.   


\[Lifemagic – Heal\]

Heals the target for Intelligence HP

Range: Intelligence SU2

Cost: 20 MP

&amp;#x200B;

At least I don’t think it will hurt my momentary survival chances, if I can heal myself. And no point in being a healer that can’t heal. The second no-brainer is of course something to attack. And there are two options that are looking like a fit.   


\[Livemagic – Lifebolt\]

Damage the target for Intelligence HP through internal injury. 150% damage against Undead.

Range: 2xIntelligence SU2

Cost: 30 MP

&amp;#x200B;

\[Mindmagic – Mindblast\]

Stuns and confuses the target as long as the Willpower of the caster is higher than that of the target. The duration of the effect is 1/100 STU per each point in Willpower the caster has more than the target. Simple animals that are driven by instinct, resist this spell with Constitution. Truly brainless targets like the \[lesser Undead\] and \[Constructs\] are not afflicted.

If the caster has 10 or more points more than the Target, real and lasting damage can happen.

Range: 2xWillpower SU2

Cost: 20 MP

&amp;#x200B;

Not an easy choice, but all in all I think I go with the Mindblast. It’s not only cheaper in MP, it’s sounds stealthier to. Speaking about stealth, given that I will have a skin that has some camouflage properties, I think that is the way to go to get back to Brisbane alive. And my Illusionsmagic looks to have what I need to get another edge for that. And to be seen by people without them killing me on sight.     


\[Illusionsmagic – Lesser Invisibility\]

By bending the light around the target it gets invisible to most sights. Movement, especially fast movements, lessens the effect.

Range: self 

Cost: 30 MP per 1/10 STU

&amp;#x200B;

\[Illusionsmagic – Personal Mask\]

Lays a Mirage over the targets body or part of his body. Mostly used for clothing illusions and to alter someone's face.

Range: self

Cost: 5 – 50 MP (depending on the area of the Illusion) and 25 MP per STU upkeep. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ok both not really cheap on the MP, but better safe than sorry. These two might save my life. So that makes four, only one left. Naturally with 71 options left, there are a lot of spells I really liked to have. But I have to think about survival first. I could still take the Lifebolt to have some direct damage, but to be fair, I soon have four tentacles and a good amount of strength. Not to forget, I have at least still my diver's knife with me. No I better go with that.   


 **\[Mindmagic – Sense hostile intent\]** **The caster senses hostile intent around him. He cannot sense if he himself is the target of the intent.** **Range: Willpower SU2** **Cost: 10 MP per STU** 

&amp;#x200B;

Cheap and makes sure nobody gets a knife, or around here his teeth, in my back. So finally, the last step should be choosing my last Boon. Of course, it is tempting to choose an insanely powerful weapon or one of the Powers that make me more powerful. But I really need something that helps me to survive. And I’m still about 240 km from Brisbane or perhaps 180 km from the next coast. Whatever I do, I will take days to get there and by the way, if I don’t want to swim trough deepwater ocean I must follow the Guyots, so it will be even more than 240 km. No weapon will help me when I need to sleep. Luckily I saw something when I read through that list earlier. There are buildings that are looking to be mobile somehow. So let's have a closer look. It didn’t take long to find them again. There are multiple kinds, and this one seams to be perfect.   


Trig´Nahlu Core Trading Cooperation’s 

Journeyman Journey Mage tower

&amp;#x200B;

The “Journeyman Journey ....” line are buildings that are able to be minimized to 1/100 of their normal size and be transported to a new place by hand or inventory.

The Mage tower variant is available with a square or circular footprint, and its magnitude is based on the size of the customer. As all buildings of this line it has:

&amp;#x200B;

Tier 1 save zone with a radius of 30 SU2

Tier 1 ambient Manacolector

Tier 1 intern atmospheric managenerator

Tier 1 intern water and waste managenerator

Tier 1 cleaning and repair function

\[System marked Interface\] including send a receive chest

Mana signature based security

Default minimal furnishing

Topographic adaptable base 

&amp;#x200B;

Chosen details: Square footprint, customer height 1, 7 SU2, 5 floors, Sandstone Please be reminded, that all our products are improvable at later time. Contact your Trig´Nahlu Core Trading Cooperation Agent for further services. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yes I take that for my \[Large Boon\]. A transportable save zone will keep me alive for the short future, and it’s always good to have my own four walls.     


You have made all relevant choices.

Stasis will end in:

0:0001:7845 STU

You will experience a certain level of disorientation and unwellness upon this point. 

This is because of a one time download of basic knowledge of your Abilities, Skills and Spells.

After exiting the stasis you will find a \[Basic Inventory Ring\] on you. It has the storage volume of 1SU2 squared. In it, you will find a book with basic knowledge about the \[Universesystem\]. Possible objects that were obtained by a boon will also be in this storage item.

&amp;#x200B;

Being \[Markus Grinsjki\], since you obtained a \[Race change\] via your \[Major Boon\], your exit out of the stasis will additionally painful.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh! shit!

Chapter 7-Private Lessons and Private Conversations

Travis stood over the pan, watching the bacon fry. He had set it in the pan about 2 minutes ago and it was sizzling rather nicely. He had eggs whipped up for scrambled eggs ready and the batter ready to fry. Mel’Bae was in the shower. It had been three months since he and Mel’Bae had started dating and things were going great. The dojo had grown in the first month to about 20 new students, but over the month it fell to about twelve, when the ladies figured out it wasn’t a dating service. Well, not *intentionally.*

Tonboon, the usually studious med student had become a bit of a ladies man. Hell, he practically had a sign-up sheet! Sensei had to take him aside and give him a talk about not hooking up inside the dojo. What he does outside is ok, but in class we gotta keep it professional. He’s almost a black belt and the rules are different when you attain that rank. Tonboon and Travis weren’t the only ones that had been involved with the Shil’vati in more than a professional manner. While Travis hadn’t seen Sensei or Sadie. Travis had seen Mark sneaking out of one of the officer’s quarters. It took Travis a moment of shock to process what he was feeling. He hadn’t had the time to even form the words in his head: *What do I do about this? Should I tell Julie*? When he then saw her, sneaking out of the same room. *Oh, well thank Goddess for that!*

*Goddess? Damn Mel’Bae’s rubbing off on me.*

Travis was staying over with her about three or four times a week now. They were still being exclusive together. They had talked about maybe adding someone new, but he wasn’t ready for that yet.

The bacon was done so he pulled it out. He skimmed off a bit of grease and then added the eggs to what remained, letting it slowly fry before folding it over itself to make sure the eggs turned out smooth and not dry. Using a towel, he wicked his forehead to keep the sweat out of his eyes from the hot stove and the hot room.

He had come up with a novel solution to staying in a room set to her preferred temperature. He was wearing a YUKATA. The thin, cotton KIMONO-like robe that was a gift from a friend during a summer festival in Japan was comfortable at Shil’vati temperatures, it also covered his body enough for their ideas of male modesty. It worked well in the kitchen too, as it kept him from violating the general rules of bachelor cooking:

1 Always wash your hands before going to the bathroom if you have been handling chilies.

2 Never fry bacon naked.

It also had one more advantage: it was easy to slip on and off.

The eggs were ready and he put them on a serving plate. Next he re-greased the pan with some of the leftover bacon grease and began to pour the batter in small batches waiting for it to fry and bubble up. When it was golden brown he flipped it over to cook on the other side.

Mel’Bae got out of the shower, she pulled on a sports bra and a pair of shorts. Then toweled her long hair off before tying it loosely behind her back, she usually did this most mornings now waiting to put it up in her usual bun until after breakfast when she had to go on duty.

Travis set the table and each scooped eggs and bacon out onto their plate. For the other item Travis had some honey (real maple syrup was out of his price range, and he refused to buy the imitation “maple flavored” crap) and some elderberry jam his mom had sent him. Mel’Bae and his mom hadn’t met in person yet, but they had talked through video conferencing. Similarly, Travis had only seen recorded messages from Mel’bae’s family. She apparently had six mothers. All of whom Travis was trying to tell apart. No real word sent by her father though. *Deal with that later,* Travis thought.

“I’ve got to run back to my apartment today,” He told Mel’Bae. “But I should be back by the time you’re off duty. I’ve got a private class with Nosis at ten o’clock and his wife probably will want to talk to me afterward.” Nosis was Agent Sommarsdar’s young husband. Travis couldn’t judge the dude for marrying into money, I mean both men and women have been doing that for centuries.

He was coming along as a good student and taking private lessons from Travis had improved him in regular classes quite a bit. Though it was odd, training with him felt a lot like training with a gentler version of Sadie. Which is either the most logical or the strangest thing to think.

“I’ll pick up some stuff from the commissary annex for dinner,” Mel’Bae offered. The Base’s version of a grocery store.“ Any chance back in town you could pick up some more of the stuff to make these?” She asked as she held up a piece of  one of the golden brown disks with her fork. “They’re really good. What are they called again?”

“They’re flapjacks.” Travis told her.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Mel’Bae gave him a quick kiss as she headed out to start her shift in the shuttle hangar. Things between them hadn’t cooled in the bedroom exactly, but they were restraining themselves from copulating in the mornings, well in the mornings she had to go on duty. If they both had Shel off…

He hung up his YUKATA and took a shower. Getting ready for his private class. The stipend the military was paying for Sensei to teach lessons was enough to keep their regular dojo open, though they still didn’t have any new students walk through the door. And with Travis teaching some private classes he had enough money to meet his needs without having to bounce if he didn’t want to. He would occasionally pick up a shift as a favor to someone, but that was just as a little extra spending money.

Showered and shaved, he put on his regular clothes and placed his GI in his backpack. He loaded up the omni-pad Mel’Bae gave him as a gift. Saved on it was the complete series of Aikido videos he could use to show Nosis to help him understand how techniques could be done. In a ready-to-transfer file he had uploaded a bunch of videos and texts for his wife to help her understand humanity better.

Perhaps it was all just subterfuge, him teaching her husband, but Agent Sommarsdar had been picking his brain to help herself understand humanity. And if it meant less loss of life to help the Shil’vati figure out how to drain the ranks of angry young men and women from the rebels, then he was happy to do it. Today’s collection was of original texts, essays, and commentaries from some of the great thinkers in human military strategy. Clausewitz, Sun Tsu, Musashi Miyamoto, Max Brooks.

All packed up he turned his attention to clearing the dishes and getting some laundry done before his class. Since he was crashing at her place he had taken up more responsibilities of basic housework. It was best to try to use the laundry room in the mornings when most of the Marines were on shift. Nobody had yet tried “the ol’ grab ‘em by the dick” brand of courtship with him yet. However the best way to win a confrontation was to not be in one. Gathering up his and Mel’Bae’s clothes he headed out.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

“SHIT!” Nosis whined as Travis corrected his movement, showing him how to lift his arm in such a way that his whole body was aligned in the movement and focused on the weakest part of his partners arm allowing it to raise easily.

“It’s OK, just remember to keep your hand inside of his arm, if it goes to the outside he ..um..or she can use their bicep to pull you down. Raising this way works on the triceps muscle which is not as strong. But the most important part of *Tenshinage* is the bottom hand. You’ve got to draw it down and to the side like this.” Travis slid at a forty-five degree angle in toward Nosis and lowered his hand that he was grabbing. Nosis’ shoulder dropped and he lost his balance. “Like this, *Tenshinage* doesn’t look like much, and almost nobody will ever grab you this way, but It has the building blocks of a lot of different moves.

“How do you remember all of this stuff!?!” He asked exasperatedly.

“Hey, remember, over ten years vs about three months. You’ll get there, you just have to keep trying and have patience. It’s like Zen meditation, minus the getting hit with sticks part. You do it a thousand times, or ten thousand times wrong then one day it comes to you.”

“If you two are ready to call it a day, I’ve got us some lunch.” Said Agent Sommarsdar coming into the room. Travis had been teaching Nosis for the last two hours in their home.

“Sure we can end here.” Travis then turned to Nosis and bowed.

“Thank you, Sensei.” Nosis called out

“Hey, remember, our Sensei is Sensei, I’m just Travis or if you want to Travis Sensei.”

“Sorry, Travis Sensei.”

“Don’t worry about it just remember next time. Ok on three.”

“*Domo arigato gozaimasu,”* They bowed to the picture of the O sensei, the founder, that Travis had brought. “Well, let’s get lunch.”

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Sitting around the table eating with the two of them it was easy to remember how alien they were.  Agent Sommarsdar treated her husband with a level of pampering or maybe mothering he and Mel’Bae definitely did not have with each other nor did he want there to be. She was practically spooning his food into his mouth for him. It made the conversation a little distracted. “What you really need to understand is very complex in its simplicity: if humans feel they are treated well, we will be the best friend you ever had. If we feel disrespected and put down, we’ll hate ya till the day you die.”

“But we are treating you well. Your standard of living has increased significantly and you are from what was the wealthiest of your nation states. What we’ve done for some of your ‘lesser developed nations’ should have been seen as a Goddess sent miracle.”

“You’re right, but that’s not how most people *feel,”* he tried to explain. “For a lot of people anti Shil’vati sentiment and resistance started when we saw the footage of that incident at the Grimmsville Hospital. None of us knew that woman, or her husband, but seeing that we all *felt* like we did. She could have been our sister, or wife, or mother. That could have been our child or grandchild. If the roles were reversed Nosis, even with amazing leaps forward in living do you think you could forgive?”

Nosis looked at Travis, you could see that the idea had struck a nerve with him. And with his wife. “Have you...”, he asked, “Been able to forgive?”

“I try to.” Travis thought about the best way to phrase his next words. “I try to remember that Shil’vati are people no better or worse. and judge the individual by their actions. Do I feel that the Shil’vati in charge should face some punishment for her incompetence? Yes.” This garnered a look from Agent Sommarsdar, She seemed to be thinking of something, or remembering. ""However, I don’t blame all of the imperium for her actions. It's hard sometimes to separate the actions of a system from that of the individuals in that system. But that’s basically how my country was founded.”

“Have you read any of the works about the British Empire?” He continued. “They, at their height, controlled a quarter of the planet. The country I grew up in was started when they felt disrespected. They fought because they were taxed without having a say in the government. From that start they became the world's largest political and military power. I grew up believing in the idea of ‘American Exceptionalism’. The idea that we were, despite our faults, the best there was. That belief has been shattered and many now *feel* that they are fighting to get that back.” Travis took a breath. “Even though they’re fighting for an idea that was a lie. Yeah America had the greatest military strength, but we also had a crumbling infrastructure and massive debt that was the cost of that military. There was a political deadlock that made sure every problem was politicized and argued about endlessly and never fixed.”

“So you never saw this American Exceptionalism?” She asked holding out another morsel for Nosis to pluck from her hand.

“I saw it every time I saw a homeless man with a sign that read:

*HOMELESS VET*

*PLEASE HELP*

*GOD BLESS”*

“I hope you’re not thinking of The Imperium as some kind of flawed saviors.” Nosis added. Which earned him a reproachful look from his wife. Travis had learned that he was the far more liberal of the two.“

“Oh God...dess no!” He blurted out. “I know you didn’t come here for our benefit but for yours. You took us over ‘cause we were here. But in the end It’s simple. Like a… a marriage.” Pointing to the two of them. “Humanity needs to feel special.”

“That’s a lot to think about,” Agent Sommarsdar replied. “But sadly our lunch needs to come to an end. I’ve got to get back to the office, my sweet.” she said to Nosis.

“Yeah I gotta get going too. Before I go though, have you thought about that riddle I gave you.”

“I have but I’m still puzzled.”

“What riddle?” Nosis asked.

“Maybe you can solve it for her. *What’s the easiest way to get someone to clean your house for free?* Think about it awhile and maybe next private class you can give me an answer.*”*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Travis walked around the grocery store picking up the ingredients for making more pancakes as well as some large ham steaks that would go well with them. It seemed like he was turning more into a homemaker, cooking and taking care of Mel’Bae, but to be honest there wasn’t much to do with his time right now that his financial situation was more stable. 

It was strange the way things that would appear bizarre to an outsider become normalized after a few months. The fact that he was practically living with Mel’Bae now was one of those bizarre facts. For humans it was bizarre because he was *livin’ in sin* with an alien woman, and for Shil’vati because he was doing it with *only one* of them. But hey, it was working for them right now so why try to mess with a good thing? However, he knew his ego would draw the line if she tried to start hand feeding him.

Nosis had been a wealth of information for Travis on how the Shil’vati were viewing his group. Being  that they are the first civilian employees on any military base. In a way, it was funny, the nicknames the ladies came up with for them sounded almost like they were a boy band. Sensei was still Sensei, but Tonboon was *the sexy one.* Sadie was *the scary one*. Julie and Mark were *the lovers.* And Travis?

*The boring one.*

Heading up to the check out Travis thought. *Who cares if I’m boring, I’ve got a lover and I’m getting laid regularly. How many of them can claim that?* The answer to that though probably depended on how tired Tonboon was on any given day. Sensei and himself might have to do another sit down with their soon to be black belt in the near future.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Travis walked down the hallway to his apartment door. Grocery bag in his left hand as he took out his phone. He had gotten through the security check point rather fast. Last time he had been stopped and taken into the back room because the marine on station was one of their students and she had a question about last class. Which then turned into a fifteen minute impromptu workshop on *Kaitennage*. Travis unlocked his phone and looked at his messages. It had been a while since he had come back to his apartment. He started writing down the codes for his door so that he wouldn't forget. He glanced at the number and then put his phone away. Even now too many people still spent most of their life looking at a screen and not paying attention. Before coming up with the idea to teach the Shil’vati, Travis had thought about printing up business cards that had the dojo’s logo and phone number on them. Then have everyone go around slapping them onto the screen of someone they notice being too absorbed in their phone or tablet or omni-pad. The card would simply read. *If you knew Aikido, I would have never got this close.*

Getting to the door he keyed in the code and pressed UNLOCK. The door pushed open. Home sweet home, except for the three men standing in his room. One of whom was the man that had followed him from the hotel.

Charm was not having a good week.

First, there had been that weird email to one of the dead drop addresses. He'd ordinarily have just ignored it, because it seemed so off the wall, even though it had shown up to a place almost no one should have known to send anything to. An address on a system that had been receiving a *vastly* larger amount of attention than it normally warranted. But there were a number of phrases in particular orders that meant it actually *was* an intentional message, and not just more random Markov chain spam.

Then he'd gotten the physical letter that made the email seem significantly more legitimate. And the contents of the SD card inside of it were… unbelievable. The photographs were incredible, even if they couldn't possibly be real. But he recognized Corwin from pictures he'd seen before, and he actually *knew* Ivy, from the year she'd presented at Blackhat, and then gone on to give someone else's presentation at DefCon after the original author had been hit with an injunction. With Fess following a half step behind her as a bodyguard the whole time, ready to ""accidentally"" knock any lawyer that tried to serve *her* with one into the pool.

But while it had all looked like some kind of weird prank at first, it seemed like some very unpleasant folks were ""unofficially"" taking it seriously. The girl in the pictures with Fess had fallen off the face of the planet a few days ago. Subtle inquiries of various systems indicated a place to start looking, where her phone had gone dark. A CCTV camera nearby had caught a reflected view of a disturbingly professional snatch and grab.

Charm: Daizu, you turn anything up on that footage I sent you?

Daizu: The license plate is in view for a couple of frames. It's listed as being registered to a company that the rumor mill has as a front for one of the sketchier departments of the German intelligence community. ""Das Dezernat Erhaltung, Reinigung und Pflege"".

Charm: The ""Department of Conservation, Cleaning and Care""? I haven't heard of that one before. Nicely alliterative, though.

Mako: Yeah, most people haven't. Their official blather says they're ""responsible for the preservation and security of public institutions and places, as well as in exceptional and dangerous situations for preventing danger.""

Charm: How incredibly bland. Wait. Their acronym is \*\*DERP\*\*?!

Daizu: Well, it predates the colloquial use by quite a bit. And, well, German. But they're the black ops group of the BfV. Wetwork, deniability, all the sort of nasty shit that the CIA gets up to sometimes. So significantly less bland than the name would suggest.

Mako: They're mostly post Cold War. They recruited quite a few people once reunification happened. You get one guess from where.

Charm: Stasi?

Taz: Stasi.

Charm: Fuck. So it's probably not actually a bunch of Eastern European script kiddies banging on my box.

Daizu: Almost certainly not.

Mako: You should probably sanitize it. I would.

Charm: Fess, what the fuck have you gotten me involved in now?

Mako: I don't know, but if they took a friend of his… well, you know how he is.

Daizu: ""Selectively sociopathic""?

Taz: I don't think I'd say sociopathic, more, just, he doesn't see people who try to hurt him or his as being deserving of the protections of being ""people"" anymore.

Taz: Ok, maybe that's kind of sociopathic.

Charm: Nah, that's not right. He knows they're people… he just doesn't \*care\* anymore if they attack first.

Daizu: Dude, you were there at the club when that guy grabbed Sil's ass and then got in her face when she slapped him for it, and he broke the guy's elbow and yanked his arm out of the socket, then just… picked up his drink and went back to his conversation like nothing happened.

Charm: Yeah, but if you talk to him… it bothers him that it doesn't bother him, if that makes any sense. An actual sociopath just wouldn't care. Anyway, what do we know about these idiots?

Mako: Beyond the fact that Fess is going to declare war on ""just"" a small branch of the German government, \*\*if we're lucky\*\*? And that he might win?

Taz: Hey, ""Governments fall"" \*is\* part of the cpunks slogan…

Daizu: I've got some zero day that might get us a peek into their systems. Maybe we can figure out where the girl ended up. It might help limit the collateral damage, anyway.

Charm: Anyone think we could get her out ourselves? We might be able to do it with less egregious property damage than if Fess pops up from wherever he's gone and goes after her himself.

Taz: It's worth exploring, for sure. But the main issue is going to be that everyone in a group like that is going to know everyone, so spoofing a transfer order is going to be damn near impossible. And frankly most of us aren't quite as into direct action as Fess is. I know you like your guns as much as any American, Charm, but you left them there when you moved here. \*\*With Fess\*\*, as I recall…

Charm: Yeah. Do we know anyone?

Mako: Not at that level.

Daizu: What about those Croatians?

Taz: We want to get her back, not stuffed into a brothel. Fess would kill them \*and\* us.

Daizu: Point.

Mako: Let's just try to figure out where she ended up for now.

Charm suspected his week wasn't getting better any time soon. But it was a good opportunity to poke a bunch of nasty bastards in the eye, so, that wasn't nothing.

When Milk opened her eyes, she was met with quite possibly the best scene she could have ever witnessed. A woman in uniform standing at the foot of her bed.

And not any woman. But a massive, 7 foot tall woman with legs like tree trunks, skin like the finest wine and tusk- Shil’vati!

Millk shot up before a firm hand pressed against her chest and forced her back onto the bed. “No.” A voice said, “You are not fit to sit up yet.” Milk looked over and saw an aging man in a white coat. The coat had the telltale stains and splotches that indicated a hard day’s work in a medical tent, and the red cross on his shoulder confirmed her theories. But the purple symbol over his heart threw her for a loop.

He noticed her looking at the mark and smiled, “Ah. When Médecins Sans Frontières and the International Red Cross sent our traditional, ‘we’re medics, don’t shoot’ message to the Empire, the Shil’vati instructed us to sew this symbol onto our coats and paint it on our trucks. It’s their red cross equivalent. Is the chosen symbol of some goddess of health and mercy back on their homeworld.” Milk nodded before relaxing and looking back to the massive, sexy woman standing at the foot of her bed.

“So.” She asks in a cracked voice, “You here to interrogate me?” Milk coughs a bit before the doctor placed a straw into her lips. Mmm. Electrolytes.

“No.” The woman replied in a deep, husky voice. What accent came through in her voice was harsh, but not unpleasant. “I have come to apologize. I was the officer in charge of this camp before the Interior took over. I should have kept a better eye on what the nobles were doing.” She scowls, “Leftennant, your own Geneva Conventions and the Shil’vati code of Campaign Ethics agree on most points regarding the treatment of Prisoners of Conquest. Of War.” She takes a breath, “What that noble did and ordered her soldiers to do broke almost every one of those ethical codes. I intend to fix that issue. As I have told everyone, I am speaking with Colonel Melikov at the moment to organize proper reimbursement and reparations along with this camp’s code. You have been put on a shortlist for replacement limbs along with other Shil’vati medical care.” Milk looked down at her pinkie. There was an odd ring where the flesh had been bitten off, faintly glowing. “I will give you further instruction and announcements when everyone is awake and able to move.” She then stood up, gave a Shil’vati salute, and marched over to another medic who was trying to get her attention.

Milk looked over to the doctor who nodded. “Two days bed rest, three days light duty. Then you’re clear of your injuries.” He said with the simple knowledge that he _would_ be obeyed.

And so Milk laid back in bed, looked at the ceiling, and drifted off to sleep.

----------

The camp gathered once more at the parade field. Chairs, blankets and other comfortable looking furniture had been set up while everyone was recovering from the riots. None of the Interior Guards remained and the Shil’vati that were present all had the strange purple symbol etched into their armor over their heart and a makeshift red cross armband strapped over their upper arm. On the stage that’s normally adorned in Shil’vati propaganda and armed guards stood two people. Well, one.

Colonel Melikov sat in a wheelchair, his right knee shattered and left leg missing, but he looked proud as the familiar and comforting Stars and Stripes rested behind him. At his left stood the Shil’vati officer. She wore no armor, instead a tight cloth and glistening scale mail that hung in a fetching way over her breasts. An ornate and gold embroidered red cloak hung over her shoulder and no flag stood behind her.

“As of now, every single person in this camp is a Citizen of the Shil’vati Empire.” The officer began, “That means you have certain rights, rights the Interior Cunts were not respecting.” It was almost soothing to see how _angry_ this officer was. It’s rare you hear someone in a position of command swear.

“My name is Sau’fai Kaltani. Mistress Of Arms and Senior Marine of the 487th Empress’s Marine Expeditionary Force.'' The guards at the side shouted something in Shil, a call and response, “My relative rank translated to your rank structures would be a low level General. If you have noticed, some of my marines have begun to take down the walls around the camp. This is because, since your nation has signed both a peace treaty and a surrender, you are now under our protection instead of our control. None of you are fit to leave. Your medics have made that quite clear to me. If you wish to disagree with your medics, you may pick up your Empire Passport, bank account information as a soldier who has been discharged from duty, and board the shuttle parked near the admin building. It will take you wherever you want. Otherwise, please remain here, we will get you briefed on what has happened since you were captured, get you started on courses on Shil and ensure you are given the best medical treatment we can provide. I have done wrong by you by not ensuring a Marine advisor to observe this camp. I will pay my debt in full.” She then nodded to the Colonel.

“I’ve been in contact with her CO, the Red Cross and the, as of now, President of the US. She isn’t lying.” He began, “We’re the last US Service Members not officially stood down by our government which has done… _interesting_ things regarding loopholes and bureaucratic mess.” He waves his hand, “Needless to say, this liberation makes things much smoother for all of us. Good news, we are no longer POW’s. Bad news, we’ve been colonized by an advanced spacefaring power we can’t even _hope_ to match in our current state.”

He stands up from his chair, shaking on a nearly shattered leg and using the wheelchair as a crutch to replace his second. “As the last active duty commander in the United States Military who has not officially surrendered to the Shil’vati military I have to say it has been an honor to serve alongside the men and women I see in front of me. Every one of you fought to the greatest of your ability and further, drawing blood on the enemy even when you had no chance of success. This flag behind me is the last American Flag flying freely and, when the clock strikes noon, I will strike my colors to honor my duty. We have lost this war, and so my duty becomes keeping you folks alive.”

Instantly the crowd of humans rose to their feet, those who could at least. They snapped to attention, ever mindful of the clocktower behind them. 11:53.

Someone saluted as the first minute ticked over, quickly followed by everyone else. The Colonel saluted back.

“Color guard!” Someone called out, “Retire the colors!”

A trio of POW’s marched forward. A Marine, a Soldier and a Sailor marched up to the flagpole and stood ready. The Colonel picked up what was going on and began to sing. “Oh say can you see…”

Milk felt tears well in her eyes as she added her voice to the mix, “By the dawn’s early light…”

Cookie joined in, his trained baritone mixing beautifully with the handful of voices raised in song one last time. “What so proudly we hailed at the twilight’s last gleaming.”

Around the group, the Shil’vati marines looked confused at what was going on before one snapped to, slamming her rifle against her shoulder and her fist over her heart. She called out two words in their harsh language and instantly every alien soldier stood at attention.

“Who’s broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight…”

The soldiers in Camp 773 sang what was soon to be called “The Last Colors Ceremony” in later media. Beaten, broken, wounded and lame. Witnessed by an alien one star general and a Colonel as the highest ranking officers, the soldiers nevertheless felt important in that moment as the clocktower rang out it’s 12 chimes and the group stood silent.

Everyone waited.

A Sailor produced the trumpet they had smuggled in a long time ago and began to play taps as the Stars and Stripes were lowered for the last time, by soldiers of a Free United States.

----------

Milk and Cookie looked at each other as they walked out of the camp together. The months of getting ID’s, passports, creating stipend accounts and learning basic Shil blurred compared to the months of hard imprisonment. The familiar leather of their flight jackets and aviators set against the sun, they boarded the soundless shuttle, feeling it barely shift as it quickly moved up and towards the sky. Bringing them to the apartment Milk had rented for them both.

“So.” Cookie began, “What now?”

Milk leaned back. “Now, we recover. And wait. And get really drunk. And we find a way to fly.”

Cookie smiled a rueful grin, “Cause what’s an aviator without their wings?”

“Nothing at all.” Milk replied, throwing a wink at the pilot who looked back to see who was talking. The pilot blushed. _Still got it._

In  this episode, we get more running, a special marching cadence, and a few big reveals. Plus some bitter-sweet and happy squad feels at the  end.  


There are only two main episodes left in Act III, then we'll be  back into the war with Act IV. I've already got a lot of Episode 16 written,  though if past experience is any indication, it'll probably still double in word count from where I'm at now by the time I finish fleshing all  the scenes out (and I'll always have a few unexpected scenes crop up before I'm done). How soon that'll all be done is still hard to say.  Work is still keeping me pretty busy, and every time I think things are going to ease up or settle down and give me more free time, it doesn't.  


On another note, I'd like to hear from  you guys on what brought you to RH, or how you heard about  the story, and what some of your favorite parts of it are so far. I  can't promise I'll give you more of everything you love (and I can't  please everyone), but knowing what you guys enjoy, and what you think is good helps me know what I'm doing right, and what I can focus on to continue doing good. I really look forward to hearing your feedback!

&amp;#x200B;

“Give me that old Marine Corps Spirit!”

&amp;#x200B;

“GIVE ME THAT OLD MARINE CORPS SPIRIT!”

&amp;#x200B;

“’Cause it’s good enough for me!”

&amp;#x200B;

“’CAUSE IT’S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME!”

&amp;#x200B;

“It was good for Chesty Puller!”

&amp;#x200B;

“IT WAS GOOD FOR CHESTY PULLER!”

&amp;#x200B;

*These people run too gods damned much!* Rinn panted as the battalion thundered around the base on their morning death march. *And oh, look, here we are, running past our barracks again, getting our hopes up just to dash them…* He stifled a whine. *At least today they’re cutting the run short for helicopter training. When this is all over and done with, I don’t ever want to run again…*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“Hahahaha! And the looks on their faces when we went evasive!” Edison kissed his fingertips and flared his hand as he backed through the bunk room door. “Perfection!”

&amp;#x200B;

“Nah, the best part was old Shields here,” Kawalksi threw a heavy arm around Rinn’s shoulders, nearly causing him to stagger into the door frame. “He was all stony faced, like, ‘I’ve done this before, this is nothing exciting,’” Kawalski said, putting on a fake deep voice. “Even as the huey went sideways!”

&amp;#x200B;

“I was trying not to throw up…” Rinn admitted, flicking an ear at Kawalski as he trudged back to his rack, sore, tired, and trying to pretend that his legs weren’t all wobbly after the day’s aerial adventures. 

&amp;#x200B;

“Yeah, what’s the straight-horned one with all the “that’s what she said” jokes, Tyaytyay?”

&amp;#x200B;

“Tyehtyeh,” Rinn corrected.

&amp;#x200B;

Kimber gave him a “whatever” wave. “Yeah, him. He puked his guts out all over the tarmac three feet after he got out when we landed.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Ha! He did better than old Stuffy McStuffyface, threw up in mid-air!” Kawalski chuckled. “Projectile vomited when we went evasive! Though, we were horizontal at the time, so it mostly just went straight out the door!”

&amp;#x200B;

“Mostly my ass!” Kimber said. “I was sitting at the down door when he spewed! He puked all over the back of my helmet!”

&amp;#x200B;

“Hahaha, yeah, it was great!” Kawalski grinned. “You should probably go clean that off, though…”

&amp;#x200B;

“Yeah, no shit.”

&amp;#x200B;

Rinn sighed as he popped his boots off, wriggling his toes and savoring their freedom. The human boots fit better than any other pair of boots he had ever been issued, and they had mostly broken in by this point, but they were still combat boots, and didn’t quite match his foot shape. He pulled his shower gear out of his pack, looking forward to a hot soak, only to watch a parade of four Marines scramble past, already half undressed and dibsing the showers first. 

&amp;#x200B;

He sighed, setting his shower kit at the end of his rack before digging out a pen and notebook. *It’s probably best to go last, anyway, now that we get more than five whole minutes of hot water… More time to soak.*

&amp;#x200B;

“More English lessons?” Bradford asked, leaning over to look at his notebook as he flipped it open. 

&amp;#x200B;

“Yeh,” he yipped, still amused the Gyani word for ‘yes’ was so close to an informal English word for the same.

&amp;#x200B;

“And what’s the word of the day?”

&amp;#x200B;

“What is the word for…” he frowned. “It is a place in a home where you build a fire…”

&amp;#x200B;

“A fireplace?” she asked.

&amp;#x200B;

He flicked an annoyed ear at her. *Of course that would be a word they used…* “Yes, but… no, that is not the meaning I’m looking for.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Mantle?”

&amp;#x200B;

He shook his head. “No, that’s not it, either. The place where the fire is, the foundation, the *hearth*.”

&amp;#x200B;

“The hearth?” she asked, and he sighed.

&amp;#x200B;

*I should have just led with the word.* The words were different, but the meanings were identical. Not everything translated so well, but many words did. “Yes, that is the word. Hirth…”

&amp;#x200B;

“*Hearth*,” she said, emphasizing the vowel sound. 

&amp;#x200B;

“Hyarth.”

&amp;#x200B;

“No, no y, stop putting y’s in everything.”

&amp;#x200B;

“YI Dyon’t knyow whyat you myean,” he yipped in heavily accented English, flicking an ear at her and sticking out his tongue.

&amp;#x200B;

She laughed, then grabbed her pillow and swung it at his head, barely missing as he fell to the side. “Now try it again, you guber.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Ha-arth,” he said, drawing the vowel out as he sat up. “Harth.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Close enough,” she said, chuckling.

&amp;#x200B;

He flicked his ears up with a smile, and jotted down the phonetic spelling in Gyani.

&amp;#x200B;

“How did you say your word for it?”

&amp;#x200B;

“Sfyisch.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Ssfayeesh.”

&amp;#x200B;

“No, sfyisch.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Sfwitch?”

&amp;#x200B;

“No, it’s not a hard tch, it’s a softer sch.” He considered for a moment. “It’s like a hissing tch. And its yi,” he yipped the short vowel sound, “Not uuhhhhwwweeeee. Stop flapping your big, fat lips.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Hey, you got lips, too, dumbass!”

&amp;#x200B;

“Yeah, but they’re not so fat and poofy, like yours!” He flicked his ears at her. “You look like you got stung by a bee.” He flicked an ear to the side. “Or a dozen.”

&amp;#x200B;

This time, the pillow did catch his head, and sent him flopping to his rack. “Oof.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Who’s got big lips now, bitch!” she said, puffing her chest out and swaying her head back and forth.

&amp;#x200B;

“I don’t know, was that your lips or your pillow you hit me with,” he said, sticking his tongue out at her, promptly earning himself another bonk. “Oof.”

&amp;#x200B;

“And just for that, you’re gonna have to wait until I’m done with the shower,” she said, hopping up and snagging her toiletries bag as a gaggle of half-dressed Marines chased each other out of the head. 

&amp;#x200B;

Rinn chuckled as he tossed her pillow back on her rack and sat back up. *That’s just more time for me to soak…*

&amp;#x200B;

“Hey, have you guys seen my Switch controllers?” Kimber asked, digging through his pack. “I can’t find them anywhere.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Where’d you have them last?” Dubois asked, not even looking up from the boot he was cleaning.

&amp;#x200B;

“I could have sworn I put them back in this pocket,” he said, tapping a pouch on his pack. “That’s where I keep them, but they’re not anywhere…”

&amp;#x200B;

“You can borrow mine,” Edison said, once again performing surgery on the squad’s GoPro. He gestured absently at his pack. “They’re in the clip-on bag, somewhere…”

&amp;#x200B;

“Thanks, man, but… I wanna find *mine*.”

&amp;#x200B;

“D’you think someone might’ve, like, grabbed ‘em by mistake, brah?” Stevens said, pulling on a clean shirt.

&amp;#x200B;

“Or not by mistake?” Miller asked. 

&amp;#x200B;

“Yeah,” Elder said, looking up from his phone. “We had that platoon thief a while back, remember?”

&amp;#x200B;

“Dude, that’s why you need to carve your name into them,” Davies said, lying on his rack playing his own Switch. He lifted his hands to show his name carved into the same kind of controllers Rinn had seen Kimber using. “That’s what I did with mine.”  


“I *had* my name on them, man, in sharpie.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Yeah, but sharpie can come off,” Edison said, still focused on the GoPro. “Alcohol or a dry-erase marker can do the trick.” 

&amp;#x200B;

Kimber grumbled something, and started expanding his search area.

&amp;#x200B;

“Hey, Shields,” Kawalski said, dropping down next to him. He only had his boxers on, and was still a little damp from the shower. “Teach me more keshmin swear words! How do you say fucknugget?” 

&amp;#x200B;

Rinn raised an ear and an eyebrow at him. “We don’t have that one.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Well, come on, then, what else have you got? I’ve got a new one for you! ‘Twat!’” Kawalski grinned. “Means ‘pussy’ in English English.”

&amp;#x200B;

Rinn flicked his ear. “Is that how you use your words words, when walking down the street street?” 

&amp;#x200B;

Kawalski laughed. “No, fuck face, it’s English spoken by the English, as opposed to real English spoken by Americans.”

&amp;#x200B;

Rinn paused, pen in mid-air, and stared straight ahead for a moment. “Wot?”

&amp;#x200B;

“Kawalski, you dumbass, the English *invented* the English language,” Dubois said. Rinn didn’t even need to look at him, he could hear the eye-roll.

&amp;#x200B;

“Guys! Guys!” Gomez stuck his head out of their supply fort. “I found some boxes we missed! They’re full of fucking duct tape!”

&amp;#x200B;

“No shit?” Kawalski said, immediately distracted by the prospect of creative acquisition. “How much?”

&amp;#x200B;

“I dunno how we missed it, hoss, there’s boxes and *boxes* of this stuff! Different colors, too!”

&amp;#x200B;

“Sweet! Grab us all a roll! Jabs, too!” Kawalski paused, then stood up. “What all colors are there?”

&amp;#x200B;

“Dunno yet, I haven’t gone through all the boxes, but there’s a few at least.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Lemme see…” Kawalski disappeared into the fort. “How the hell did we miss all this… Oh, I see, it got buried behind the fuck tent.”

&amp;#x200B;

Dubois looked up. “Why do you have a fuck tent?!”

&amp;#x200B;

“Dude, you *always* need a fuck tent!”

&amp;#x200B;

“Who the fuck are you fucking!?”

&amp;#x200B;

“Your mother! Heheheh!”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Rinn pulled the earmuffs off his head as the firing line was declared cold. The new earmuffs they had been given had deeper cups with more room for his ears, but they still didn’t fit well. *We’ll have to talk to somebody about getting some properly designed for us*, he thought as he trudged down range to collect his targets. The Marines had scrounged up a few more of their pop-up metal targets for the “new” range, but they were mostly still shooting at paper targets tacked to wooden frames. 

&amp;#x200B;

Back at the tables behind the firing line, Rinn looked over the keshmin targets with a pleased quirk to his ears. Their scores were not anything the Marines would consider *good*, by any means, but even the grizzled Gunnery Sergeant running the range begrudgingly nodded his approval at them being *passable*. Barely.

&amp;#x200B;

*Not bad at all, for what little training we’ve managed to fit in around everything else.* *Lord Anyo is even showing a particular knack for the weapons, at least on the fixed range.* Rinn was pleased to note that his own scores had surpassed Anyo’s on the dynamic range, much to the Knight Captain’s chagrin.

&amp;#x200B;

Lunch consisted of MREs at the range, and Rinn once again got to demonstrate his “advanced knowledge” of human equipment to the other keshmin, and warned them away from the less favorable MREs. *Not that I’ve actually* tried *many of them, but our pallets seem to match close enough that I’ll take the Marines at their word.*

&amp;#x200B;

The lunch break was short, barely enough time to heat the food and gulp it down, before they were hurried off to the next event on the range, this one pushing the artificers to their magical limits.

&amp;#x200B;

“Cease fire! Cease fiiire!” 

&amp;#x200B;

Rinn panted, overheated and out of breath, as he lowered his stave. The targets down range were shredded, both by gunfire and spellfire, but this wasn’t a measure of accuracy.

&amp;#x200B;

“Most impressive, Ahyat,” Yeshai said as Rinn stepped back from the firing line. “How many armor enhancements were you able to maintain?”

&amp;#x200B;

“All twelve of them, Your Grace,” Rinn said, still trying to catch his breath. “But I couldn’t keep up with the machine guns. I could barely keep up with one, nevermind three!” He shook his head, making sure to close his mouth to keep his tongue from lolling, though his ears still flopped a bit. “The best I could do was one enhancement every fifth or sixth shot with two. One in a dozen with three.”

&amp;#x200B;

Yeshai snorted. “No worse than anyone else so far, and you did it while maintaining all armor enhancements, a very fine shield, and respectable spellfire of your own.” He flicked an ear. “Any of us might surpass you in single skills, but on the whole, I’d dare say you’re the best of us, and by no small margin.”

&amp;#x200B;

“You honor me, your grace,” Rinn said, giving him a bow.

&amp;#x200B;

“Your service honors the kingdom,” Yeshai replied, dipping his head in return.

&amp;#x200B;

Straightening, Rinn couldn’t miss Anyo glaring at him, but he pointedly ignored the Earl. Sinyan had gone before Rinn, but Anyo had gone before him, and all but confirmed Rinn’s suspicions that the Knight Captain was a sparker.

&amp;#x200B;

“And who’s our next contestant?” Gunnery Sergeant Valdez called as Rinn flopped down next to Bradford, happily guzzling the bottle of water she handed him. 

&amp;#x200B;

“Tyehtyeh, that’s you!” Yenyed called, glaring at the oblivious artificer.

&amp;#x200B;

“Oh, right!” Tyehtyeh said, looking up from the spellstructs he had been studying. He barely even put on his false-deep voice.

&amp;#x200B;

“Oh, here we go…” Bradford muttered, rolling her eyes.

&amp;#x200B;

“Don’t be spiteful,” Rinn said, flicking her ear with his tail. She swiped at the offending appendage and tried to grab it, but he quickly snatched it out of her reach. “He’s made incredlbe progress these last two weeks. He hasn’t admitted it, but I’m fairly certain he’s had no formal education as an artificer, or even at all.”

&amp;#x200B;

She raised an eyebrow at him. “So his bluster’s all just a show, deflecting from his … ignorance?”

&amp;#x200B;

He dipped his head with an affirmative ear flick. “And the more I give him to study, the less he remembers to put on the act.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Huh…” Bradford said, giving Tyehtyeh a newly appraising look.

&amp;#x200B;

“Line ready?” Valdez called out. “Shooter’s stand-by! FIIIRE!”

&amp;#x200B;

Tyehtyeh immediately popped up a shield and sent a triple burst of tight, powerful firebursts down range, before the Marines could rack their bolts and engage. Brief flashes of light rolled down the line as armor enhancements went up. 

&amp;#x200B;

*He still needs to kill that startup flare, but at least he’s cut out the continual glow, and his efficiency is a hundred fold better. He’s barely leaking any mana!*

&amp;#x200B;

Tyehtyeh hesitated as the rifles opened up, several rounds zipping down range unseen. He rolled his ears, shifted his feet, and every single shot became a visible bolt, glowing as it snapped down range.

&amp;#x200B;

More rifles opened up, then a machine gun, then two, then tree. Rinn’s ears shot up under his earmuffs. Every single round glowed.

&amp;#x200B;

Then Tyehtyeh brought his stave to bear and let off a barrage that made Rinn’s spellfire look like a peashooter. 

&amp;#x200B;

“CEASE FIRE! CEASE FIIRE!” Valdez called as the targets disappeared into several plumes of splinters and smoke.

&amp;#x200B;

“Holy shit!” Bradford said. “He hits like an artillery piece!”

&amp;#x200B;

Rinn looked at her, then to Tyehtyeh, then to Yeshai and the other keshmin. A small part of his mind was pleased to note that he wasn’t the only one whose jaw was hanging open.

&amp;#x200B;

“Did I mess up again?” Tyehtyeh asked, sheepishly scratching at the base of a horn.

&amp;#x200B;

Yeshai shook his head, the first to collect himself. “No. No, you didn’t.” He looked at Rinn, forcing the field artificer to collect himself. “Second Artificer, you wouldn’t happen to have a metering artifice in your repertoire, would you?”

&amp;#x200B;

He cocked an ear to the side, wondering what the Duke was getting at, before it clicked. “Yes, your grace, I do.…” he stood up, retrieving his stave, and walked over to Tyehtyeh with Yeshai. The Marines and other nobles muttered amongst themselves in their separate groups as Tyehtyeh squirmed under the unexpected attention. 

&amp;#x200B;

“Second Artificer Tyehtyeh, have you ever been officially metered?” Yeshai asked, stopping in front of him.

&amp;#x200B;

“Well, ah, no, Your Grace,” Tyehtyeh said, scratching at the base of a horn. “Militia really only ever cared that I could sling spells, didn’t much care for any of the details.”

&amp;#x200B;

“I suspected as much,” Yeshai said, dipping his head in a small nod. He flicked an ear at Rinn, then back to Tyehtyeh. “Second Artificer Ahyat, if you would be so kind.”

&amp;#x200B;

Rinn nodded and stepped forward, his stave held low in one hand. He didn’t really need it to run this particular artifice, but he suspected the extra precision and peak range it allowed would be useful.

&amp;#x200B;

“What’s this, then?” Valdez asked, stepping up to the line.

&amp;#x200B;

“The lad has never been officially metered,” Yeshai said, waving a hand at Tyehtyeh, an exaggerated gesture probably for the human’s benefit. “He has no idea how powerful he actually is. We’re about to find out.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Will this hurt?” Tyehtyeh asked, his ears nervously twitching back.

&amp;#x200B;

“Of course not,” Rinn said. “You don’t even really need to do anything. Just passively channel a mana stream.” He paused. “Down range, if you please.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Right,” Tyehtyeh said, turning to point a hand down range. Rinn brought up the metering artifice, set so the measurements were visible in the air. At first, there was nothing, then Tyehtyeh closed his eyes and everything spiked. 

&amp;#x200B;

“Above and below…” Yeshai muttered as Rinn scrabbled to shift the ranges the meter was displaying. Tyehtyeh blew past the maximum levels. Twice. “You’re a gods-damned savant!”

&amp;#x200B;

“What?!” Tyehtyeh squeaked, spinning around and cutting off the mana stream.

&amp;#x200B;

“Not just a savant,” Rinn said, his eyes and ears locked on the measurements his artifice was still displaying. “Your Grace, he’s one of the most powerful savants to ever live.”

&amp;#x200B;

“What?!” Tyehtyeh said again, this time with a little less squeak. “That can’t be right…”

&amp;#x200B;

Yeshai, turned to Valdez. “Gunnery Sergeant, we are done here for today. We need to do a complete examination and assessment of Second Artificer Tyehtyeh’s abilities, and I need to write to the King.”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Scrubbing her face, Bradford trudged around the corner of a building on her way back to the barracks, after dark, and smacked right into someone. “Oh, shit!” she said, stumbling back while fumbling out to catch the other person before they fell. 

&amp;#x200B;

Bradford kept her balance. The other person he the ground with a yipped, “Oof.”

&amp;#x200B;

Looking down, horrified at her clumsy inattentiveness, she found Rinn glaring up at her. “I was hoping to run into you on my way back, but I didn’t mean for you to take it *literally!*” 

&amp;#x200B;

She laughed, reaching down to help him up. “Sorry, I’m just a little brain-dead right now.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Oh,” he said, standing and dusting himself off. He flicked an ear at her. “I couldn’t tell the difference.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Oh, fuck you,” she said, giving him a shove that sent him staggering and nearly back into the dirt.

&amp;#x200B;

“Abuse!” he cried, struggling not to laugh. “Help! Help! I’m being abused!”

&amp;#x200B;

Bradford just continued walking, flipping him the bird over her shoulder.

&amp;#x200B;

“That rough a day?” he asked, jogging briefly to catch up. “Too much going on on your surprise afternoon off?”

&amp;#x200B;

“Pff, I wish.” She sighed, waving at the barracks ahead of them in the distance. “Most of the guys got the rest of the day off, thanks to Tyehtyeh, but not me.” She shook her head. “Nooo, I’m a Sergeant now, with ‘field experience,’” she said, with air quotes. “Since I happened to be free for the afternoon, I got pulled into another planning meeting for the field exercise we’re doing at the end of the week.” She shook her head. “Normally, these things are all planned out weeks in advance, but now we’re trying to cram that all into a few days…. Ugh!” she scrubbed her face again, heaving a sigh. “What about you? How was your afternoon?” 

&amp;#x200B;

Rinn sighed, his shoulders sagging. “Probably not much better.” His ears twitched, and he shook his head, letting them flop around. “More testing with metering artifices more precise and capable than mine will be required to know his exact power, but between myself, the Duke, and the other nobles, we were able to determine that Tyehtyeh is a savant, and one of the most powerful to ever live. There are two, maybe three other savants alive who are more powerful than him, and those not by much.” He scrunched his snout. “And he has the education of a quillhog farmer!”

&amp;#x200B;

Bradford laughed. “Sounds like someone’s a little pissed off that their spot as the top artificer has been stolen by an uneducated bumpkin.”

&amp;#x200B;

“I’m not pissed off!” Rinn snapped. “Not about that, anyway,” he sighed, tugging at a horn. “It’s just- I’ve taught Tyehtyeh a hundred times more in the last few weeks than anyone else has ever taught him. Almost everything he knows, *he learned on his own!* He’s not just a savant, he’s not just one of the most powerful savants to ever live. I have to admit, he’s one of the smartest people I’ve ever met.” 

&amp;#x200B;

“Oh, really?” Bradford asked, raising an eyebrow at him. 

&amp;#x200B;

“Yes!” Rinn rolled his ears. “Now, of course, he doesn’t act like it at all, not in the least, *because he has the education of a quillhog farmer!* But instead of a bumbling idiot who can barely figure out which end of his pike to point at the enemy, he taught himself how to do magic from scratch, using a bare handful of spells he was shown as an example, and a few concepts he overheard in conversation.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Damn,” Bradford said, shaking her head. “Imagine what he could do if someone taught him.”

&amp;#x200B;

Rinn vigorously nodded his head, eyes wide and ears up. “That’s exactly what we just saw today! And if he had a proper education.…” He shook his head. “The Duke has written his father and the King, and the nobles of are two minds about what to do with Tyehtyeh. On the one hand, he should be sent to a university, trained and educated. In time, he might become the most powerful savant to ever live!” 

&amp;#x200B;

“On the other hand, he’s useful now?”

&amp;#x200B;

“Yes.” He sighed. “The education he should get would take years, when he is already a powerful battlefield savant, and we are in desperate need of every advantage in the war.”

&amp;#x200B;

“So what are they going to do with him?”

&amp;#x200B;

“I don’t know. The Duke has a lot of influence to sway that decision, but it will not be made by him. That is for his father, Lord General Yangri, and the King to decide.” He sighed. “Until that decision is made, I will be continuing my tutelage of Tyehtyeh, and the other artificers will provide selections of well-designed spell structures for him to study and master.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Sounds like a bunch of bullshit to worry about tomorrow,” she said as he opened the door to their barracks and waved her in. “It’s late enough as it is.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Indeed,” he said, following her through the door. His ears twitched as they approached the bunk room. Bradford could here muffled shouts and laughter coming from inside. 

&amp;#x200B;

Glancing at Rinn, who gave her a smirking flick of an ear, she opened the door. The room fell to immediate silence as it swung open, the bright light of the hallway casting a sharp outline into the dimmed room.

&amp;#x200B;

Inside, every other member of Second Squad was wearing assorted styles and colors of masks made out of duct tape. The diversity of styles included cut-out or molded eye holes, teeth, full cheek guards, bikers goggles, a medieval doctor’s beak, mohawks, and more. Holding a wild medley of cardboard-and-duct-tape melee weapons, they were clad in little else besides a chaotic mix of speedos, diapers, vests, and/or a few get-ups that looked suspiciously like pleasure harnesses, all made from a rainbow of duct tape. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the dim light and resounding silence, they all turned to stare at the door.

&amp;#x200B;

Bradford slowly cast her gaze across them as she looked from one side of the room to the other, the Marines all frozen and staring at her in silence, before she quietly backed out and shut the door.

&amp;#x200B;

“We’re going somewhere else for a while,” she said, still staring at the door she firmly held shut.

&amp;#x200B;

Rinn’s ears, held straight up, swiveled to point behind him. “That… That sounds like an excellent idea…” 

&amp;#x200B;

“Yeah…” she said, releasing the door and pulling herself away. She looked at Rinn. “Anyone ever show you how to play Xbox?”

&amp;#x200B;

“I can’t say that I have,” he said as she pointedly ignored what sounded like Kawalski’s muted shouting behind the door.

&amp;#x200B;

“Sounds like a great time to learn,” she said as muffled chaos exploded behind the door. She turned and headed towards the common room. “C’mon, I’ll teach you how to play Call of Duty, and we can see what other games they managed to snag. I haven’t had time to play anything since they set the system up.”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Rinn fidgeted as Echo Company formed up outside their barracks complex. He was nervous. First Sergeant Khatri had found out about his cadence project. He was nervous because he expected to be called on to lead the whole company through his new cadence.

&amp;#x200B;

He was also nervous because he was the one who told First Sergeant Khatri about it the night before. That’s why he had run into Bradford on the way back to the barracks. He gave a silent prayer to all the gods above and all the gods below that the squad wouldn’t find out.

&amp;#x200B;

“Company! Atten-hut!” Rinn snapped to attention with the other Marines as Khatri marched out in front of them. “Marines! It has come to my attention that one of our augments has been undertaking a little cadence project, translating a Ganlin marching song into a Marine Corps cadence. Is this true, Second Artificer Ahyat?”

&amp;#x200B;

Rinn had to struggle to keep his ears from plastering back against his skull. “Yes, First Sergeant!”

&amp;#x200B;

“And it is my understanding that it is in a workable state. Is this true, Second Artificer Ahyat?”

&amp;#x200B;

Rinn hesitated. He swore he could hear a pin drop. “Yes, First Sergeant!”

&amp;#x200B;

“Outstanding! Now, as you all know, I take great pride and joy in a proper marching cadence, and to hear this warms my heart.” He clutched a hand to his chest for emphasis. “The deep, sub-cockle regions of it. Second Artificer Ahyat, you will be leading us in this cadence today!”

&amp;#x200B;

“Yes, First Sergeant!”

&amp;#x200B;

With the closest Rinn had ever seen Khatri come to a smile, the First Sergeant made a crisp about face and saluted Captain Spader. “The company is formed and ready, sir!”

&amp;#x200B;

“Very well. Get them moving, First Sergeant.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Aye, aye, sir!”

&amp;#x200B;

Khatri pivoted and marched to his place in the column. “Company! Forward! March!”

&amp;#x200B;

Feet crunched on gravel and packed dirt as Echo Company stepped off. Khatri called out a basic cadence as he turned their column out of their little assembly area, what the Marines had started calling the grinder, and onto the road.

&amp;#x200B;

“Ahyat!” Khatri shouted as the last of the Marines snaked onto the road. “Sound off!”

&amp;#x200B;

Rinn cleared his throat. “Yipe! Yipe! Yegh!” he shouted, the corners of his mouth twitching as the Marines echoed back the nonsense sounds. *Here we go,* he thought, taking a deep breath.

&amp;#x200B;

“I left my heart in San’Riiaaaaa!” he called out in English. His t’s were still a little soft, and he still dragged out his vowels a bit longer than he should, but his accent was still clear.

&amp;#x200B;

“I LEFT MY HEART IN SAN’RIIAAAA!” The Marines echoed back, and he could hear the surprise in their voices. He smiled and called the next line.

&amp;#x200B;

“I left my heart to heed the caaaall!”

&amp;#x200B;

“I LEFT MY HEART TO HEED THE CAAAALL!” The Marines’ voices were stronger, more certain, adapting quickly. 

&amp;#x200B;

“I left my heart to shield her theerre!”

&amp;#x200B;

“I LEFT MY HEART TO SHIELD HER THEERRE!”

&amp;#x200B;

“I left my heart to goo to waaaar!”

&amp;#x200B;

“I LEFT MY HEART TO GO TO WAAAAR!”

&amp;#x200B;

“Chorus!” he shouted, before taking another breath.

&amp;#x200B;

“We carry on the looong campaaaign!

We steel our hearts and maaarch aloooong!

To keep the war awaay from hooome!

We raise our pikes and neeever yieeeld!

‘Til we’ve freed the yoke from all Gahlaaa!”

&amp;#x200B;

He closed his eyes for a beat. He could already tell his throat was going to be sore when this was all done, but he wasn’t going to bungle it. Another breath, and he shouted again.

&amp;#x200B;

“I found my boots in Rotiyiiiin!”

&amp;#x200B;

“I FOUND MY BOOTS IN ROTIYIIIN!”

&amp;#x200B;

“I learned to march in formatioon!”

&amp;#x200B;

“I LEARNED TO MARCH IN FORMATIOON!”

&amp;#x200B;

“In line and square and in colummn!”

&amp;#x200B;

“IN LINE AND SQUARE AND IN COLUMMN!”

&amp;#x200B;

“To bear my heart in San’Riiaa!”

&amp;#x200B;

“TO BEAR MY HEART IN SAN’RIIAA!”

&amp;#x200B;

This time, a few Marines joined in on the long notes of the chorus.

&amp;#x200B;

“We carry on the looong campaaaign!

We steel our hearts and maaarch aloooong!

To keep the war awaay from hooome!

We raise our pikes and neeever yieeeld!

‘Til we’ve freed the yoke from all Gahlaaa!”

&amp;#x200B;

A few more had joined before the chorus had finished.

&amp;#x200B;

“I donned my armor in Toiyooo!”

&amp;#x200B;

“I DONNED MY ARMOR IN TOIYOOO!”

&amp;#x200B;

“I wrapped myself in clooth and steeeel!”

&amp;#x200B;

“I WRAPPED MYSELF IN CLOOTH AND STEEEEL!”

&amp;#x200B;

“Re-enforced with maail and speeell!”

&amp;#x200B;

“RE-ENFORCED WITH MAAIL AND SPEEELL!”

&amp;#x200B;

“To shield my heart in San’Riiaaa!”

&amp;#x200B;

“TO SHIELD MY HEART IN SAN’RIIAAA!”

&amp;#x200B;

Marine voices started to overpower his as he drove into the chorus once more.

&amp;#x200B;

“We carry on the looong campaaaign!

We steel our hearts and maaarch aloooong!

To keep the war awaay from hooome!

We raise our pikes and neeever yieeeld!

‘Til we’ve freed the yoke from all Gahlaaa!”

&amp;#x200B;

“I grabbed my pike in Mol’Raiii!”

&amp;#x200B;

“I GRABBED MY PIKE IN MOL’RAIII!”

&amp;#x200B;

“Enchanted bright and shaarp of biiite!”

&amp;#x200B;

“ENCHANTED BRIGHT AND SHAARP OF BIIITE!”

&amp;#x200B;

“I lift it up and hoold it hiiigh!”

&amp;#x200B;

“I LIFT IT UP AND HOOLD IT HIIIGH!”

&amp;#x200B;

“To guard my heart in San’Riiaaa!”

&amp;#x200B;

“TO GUARD MY HEART IN SAN’RIIAAA!”

&amp;#x200B;

The Marines had picked up the chorus this time, and he could barely hear his own voice over theirs.

&amp;#x200B;

“We carry on the looong campaaaign!

We steel our hearts and maaarch aloooong!

To keep the war awaay from hooome!

We raise our pikes and neeever yieeeld!

‘Til we’ve freed the yoke from all Gahlaaa!”

&amp;#x200B;

“I earned my strips in Riiun Paaass!”

&amp;#x200B;

“Blood stripes!” someone shouted in the brief gap before the rest of the company echoed back.

&amp;#x200B;

“I EARNED MY STRIPS IN RIIUN PAAASS!”

&amp;#x200B;

“At Koilay, Bruhl, and Sai’Li’Unnn!”

&amp;#x200B;

“AT KOILAY, BRUHL, AND SAI’LI’UNNN!”

&amp;#x200B;

“In blood and fire I baattle throuuuugh!”

&amp;#x200B;

“IN BLOOD AND FIRE I BAATTLE THROUUUUGH!”

&amp;#x200B;

“To win my heart in San’Riiaaa!”

&amp;#x200B;

“TO WIN MY HEART IN SAN’RIIAAA!”

&amp;#x200B;

This time the Marines beat him to the chorus, and he straightened in pride as voice was drowned out by a company two hundred strong.

&amp;#x200B;

“WE CARRY ON THE LOOONG CAMPAAAIGN!

WE STEEL OUR HEARTS AND MAAARCH ALOOOONG!

TO KEEP THE WAR AWAAY FROM HOOOME!

WE RAISE OUR PIKES AND NEEEVER YIEEELD!

‘TIL WE’VE FREED THE YOKE FROM ALL GAHLAAA!”

&amp;#x200B;

“I yearn to see my heaarth and hooome!”

&amp;#x200B;

“I YEARN TO SEE MY HEAARTH AND HOOOME!”

&amp;#x200B;

“Family, friends, and soomeone mooore!”

&amp;#x200B;

“FAMILY, FRIENDS, AND SOOMEONE MOOORE!”

&amp;#x200B;

“I promise one day too retuuurn!”

&amp;#x200B;

“I PROMISE ONE DAY TOO RETUUURN!”

&amp;#x200B;

“To see my heart in San’Riiaaa!”

&amp;#x200B;

“TO SEE MY HEART IN SAN’RIIAAA!”

&amp;#x200B;

“WE CARRY ON THE LOOONG CAMPAAAIGN!

WE STEEL OUR HEARTS AND MAAARCH ALOOOONG!

TO KEEP THE WAR AWAAY FROM HOOOME!

WE RAISE OUR PIKES AND NEEEVER YIEEELD!

‘TIL WE’VE FREED THE YOKE FROM ALL GAHLAAA!”

&amp;#x200B;

“I left my heart in San’Riiaaaaa!”

&amp;#x200B;

“I LEFT MY HEART IN SAN’RIIAAAA!”

&amp;#x200B;

“I left my heart to heeed the caaaall!”

&amp;#x200B;

“I LEFT MY HEART TO HEEED THE CAAAALL!”

&amp;#x200B;

“I left my heart to shield her theerre!”

&amp;#x200B;

“I LEFT MY HEART TO SHIELD HER THEERRE!”

&amp;#x200B;

“I left my heart to go to waaaar!”

&amp;#x200B;

“I LEFT MY HEART TO GO TO WAAAAR!”

&amp;#x200B;

He held the last note to signal the end of the cadence. The Marines copied the long note, and it trailed off as they made the final turn, approaching the rest of the battalion’s formation. *The First Sergeant timed that well…* he thought, but felt one last call was needed. “Royal Host, Never Yield! Two-Five!”

&amp;#x200B;

“RETREAT, HELL!”

&amp;#x200B;

“Company! Halt!”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“Guh, my head feels like mush,” Bradford said as they trudged into the gym. “I swear to god, if I have to go to one more strategy seminar or training planning session, my brains will all ooze out of my head and have to be mopped up off the floor…”

&amp;#x200B;

“Don’t worry, Jabs,” Edison said, tapping her arm. “We’ve got your favorite activity to make up for it: Picking up heavy things and putting them back down.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Damn straight!” she laughed.

&amp;#x200B;

“Raaawwwgh!” Edison said, flexing his arms in front of him. “She-Hulk STRONG!”

&amp;#x200B;

Laughing, she gave him a shove hard enough to send him staggering off to the side. “Stronger than you, pencil-arms.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Why do we keep having to sit through all these seminars, anyway?” Kimber asked. “We’re Marines. You don’t put us in classrooms. You give us a gun, and point us at whatever you need destroyed.”

&amp;#x200B;

“It’s to figure out how to train the next guys,” Bradford said, stepping over to a weight bench. “Got my spot?” Rinn and Edison paired up by a couple of benches by the dumbbell rack nearby while the rest of the squad dispersed through the gym.

&amp;#x200B;

“Sure,” Kimber said, stepping over to the weight rack. “How much to start?”

&amp;#x200B;

“Fifty on the bar to warm up a bit, then up from there.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Cool,” he said, grabbing a weight. “And what do you mean, figure out how to train the next guys?”

&amp;#x200B;

“The next guys,” she said, locking a weight on her side of the bar, then settling down on the bench. “The next group of Marines and Artificers, or Soldiers and Artificers, or whoever the fuck else gets sent through this program.” She took a grip on the bar as Kimber moved into position at the head of the bench, and with barely a grunt she heaved it off the rack and started doing reps.

&amp;#x200B;

“When did we get put into a program?” Kimber asked.

&amp;#x200B;

“We’re not in a… program,” Bradford grunted out between reps. “We’re… pathfinding it. The training program… that integrates artificers and the U.S. military.” 

&amp;#x200B;

After several reps, she shoved the bar back up on the racks and stood up, wiping sweat off with a towel as she switched places with Kimber.

&amp;#x200B;

“You think they’re making this a program?” Kimber asked, heaving the bar off the rack and starting his own set of reps.

&amp;#x200B;

“Fuck yeah, they are. No putting that cat back in the bag. We’re just kind of the pilot, fumbling our way through, figuring shit out for the people that’ll come next.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Hadn’t really thought of that,” Kimber said, putting the bar back up on the rack after his set.

&amp;#x200B;

Bradford snorted as she grabbed more weight for the bar. “You’re a Marine. You don’t get paid to think. Good thing, too,” she winked at him.

&amp;#x200B;

“Damn straight!” he laughed, locking a matching weight on the other side of the bar and moving back to the spotter position. 

&amp;#x200B;

Their conversation tapered mostly to insults and encouragement as they added more weight with each set. 

&amp;#x200B;

They were just locking another set of weights on the bar when Kawalski called over. “Kimber! We need you! Gomer thinks he’s the wrestling champion!”

&amp;#x200B;

Kimber glanced back at Bradford, but Edison spoke up. “Go ahead, man, I’ll spot for her.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Ha!” Bradford snorted. “Spotter needs to be able to at least help lift the weight that’s being benched, and that ain’t happening with your pencil arms, and I could probably bench Ahyat for reps.” She glanced at him. “No offense.”

&amp;#x200B;

He shook his head with a dismissive ear flick. “None taken.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Ha, I bet you could!” Edison said.

&amp;#x200B;

“Kimber!”

&amp;#x200B;

“I can’t, man! Jabs is gonna bench Shields!”

&amp;#x200B;

“What?!”

&amp;#x200B;

“Jabs is gonna bench Shields!”

&amp;#x200B;

Bradford laughed, glancing at a bewildered Rinn.

&amp;#x200B;

“Man, I gotta see this,” Elder said, elbowing his way to the front of the crowd that spontaneously formed around the weight bench. It felt like half of Echo Company was there.

&amp;#x200B;

“Hey, how many reps you bet she can do with him?” Kawalski asked, hustling the crowd even as it formed.

&amp;#x200B;

Bradford looked at Rinn again as a pair of Marines lifted the bar out of the way. He was shoved towards the bench, and his ears drooped in defeat.  

&amp;#x200B;

“No,” she said, shaking her head. “I’m not benching him.”

&amp;#x200B;

“But, Jabs-“ Kimber said, before she interrupted him.

&amp;#x200B;

“Dude. He’s, what, one ten?” She raised an eyebrow at Rinn. “One fifteen, soaking wet, with a brick in your pocket?” He shrugged his ears, flicking the end of his tail at her. “I just repped one thirty,” she said, pointing her thumb at the bar, “And upped it to one forty-five. I’ve got nothing to prove by benching Ahyat.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Aw, c’mon, Jabs,” Kawalski said. “It’s not about provin’ nothin’, it’s about bein’ funny!”

&amp;#x200B;

“I said no, Kawalski.”

I’m a new writer so I’m open to any and all critiques but be gentle. 

This is a short one but It made sense to end the chapter here

Chapter 2

I opened my eyes. My head is pounding, my vision is blurry, not that it matters since it’s pitch black. I taste dried blood on my lips. I try to move around but my hands and legs are tied up. I try to break free but I’m just so tired...my eyes drift shut.

I hear a metal on metal slam. My eyes jolt open, I still can’t see anything. I can’t move my hands or feet, but I can tell I’m naked. I hear footsteps on the metallic deck, the densest footsteps I’ve ever heard. 

“where the hell am I!?” I said out loud.

“Yehar va la toruk. Fragtok drokko rolltop” something said to me with a surprisingly high pitched voice. 

“I don’t speak your stupid fucking language asshole! Where am I!?” I shouted at the stranger.

Some lights came on. I’m in a cage, in the middle of what looks like a cargo hold. There are crates of different sizes and materials stacked up all around my enclosure. 

&lt;I&gt;They tied me up AND put me in a cage?&lt;/i&gt;

 I look around some more, and I and I saw it..her? Looking at me. Purple skin, big beautiful eyes, tusks like the wild pigs I hunt when I’m back home. She’s wearing a tight White body suit with strange markings on it. She’s built like a 7 ft. tall Sophia Vergara.  She looks at me, and clicks a button on her collar. 

“Prisoner. What is your name?” A voice says out loud, the words don’t match the movement of her lips. 

“Fuck you I won’t tell you shit! Where the hell am I? what the hell are you!?” I shout at my captor. 

“Listen, human.” The words sounded like venom, even from the robotic voice of the translator.  “You are a prisoner of Princess 
Latana, Grand-Daughter of the Empress herself. Commander of the Black Armada. You will do as you are commanded, or, as disappointing as it’d be for everyone here, I’ll cut off that pretty cock of yours and feed it to you.” 

After hearing that threat I decided to change my tune..a bit. We can tell captors our name and service number anyway. 

“My name is Petty Officer 1st Class Erik Peterson. My service number is 449-05-4367.” I said coldly.

“Okay. I didn’t ask you for the number, Petty Officer Peterson. Don’t tell me another piece of information that I didn’t ask for. Got it?” She said with a glare. 

I kept silent, but my blood is boiling.  &lt;i&gt;Who does this alien fucking think she is?&lt;/i&gt;

She looks at her iPad looking thing, taps it a few times, looks at me and says “We’ve been examining your culture for years, I know you are American. What state are you from?” 

“My name is Petty Officer 1st Class Erik Peterson. My service number is 449-05-4367.” I repeated. 

Every inch of my body reeled in pain as electricity hit me through my restraints for several seconds. I smell the skin on my wrists and ankles burning. 

“Your government has already fallen. You are our property now. Any further resistance to my questions will be met with lethal force.”  She yelled. The translator matching her tone. 

&lt;i&gt;I need to swallow my pride and cooperate. If she’s telling the truth then I need to escape and find my grandparents. I can’t do that if I’m dead.&lt;/i&gt;

it has been a short time sense she had made it to this wretched backwater planet brought under the empress domain, enjoyed the heat of the local star on her bare skin, some fun times with her husband's and met one of the most **BRUTAL** scenes of carnage ever being *witness* by any agent of the empress with how **SAVAGE** this lot went to show their displeasure... all because of a pair of videos from a noble's usual attitude to the plebs under the shil'vati banner.

sure some locals died when a simple id check would have suffice but as it was the situation was handle so poorly that now not only do these locals ""humans"" went from docile populous to outright danger for the troops keeping the ""peace"" if it can be called that as i have been sent to this deceitfully pleasant area to clean yet **ANOTHER** mess made by a pair of noblewomen in charge of this ""civilians"", yeah right... such a minor mishandle set off the whole REGION from green to red overnight.

empress above it was suppose to be a simple visit to the cunts that made waves to tides so fast they are somewhat of a cautionary tale to the rest of the nobles put in place to pacify this celestial body.

well, better start with this call...

with a salute befitting the station ""may the empress smile upon you high Governess M’Pravasi""

""and her grace be hail, agent Me'vesa what a unexpected call, to what i owned this chat?""

maintaining a professional pose she began the string of bad news ""sadly by the information gather I'm to be the bearer of bad news"" with a supple breath she continued ""as of 5 hours local time the entire region of the so called 'latino America', 'south America' and 'centro America' has been reclassified as a red zone"" dying a little inside by the way M’Pravasi face took the following will not be more palatable.

""this situation was by the accounts i could gather on limited time instigated by governess T'alíem and and'lir in a 'friendly' wager for who could have the least trouble in her section"" bringing the data of the casualties to peruse on a side she kept on ""at first this was received by the locals with an apathic attitude as all the things propose were for renovation of some crippling infrastructures dotting the place, nothing to worry there as work crews and materials were set to be deliver within a standard timetable"".

seeing M’Pravasi calming her features to neutrality as she read the list of marine casualties as Me'vesa went to the heart of the matter ""what set off the whole continent on fire was the video of the hospital in Maryland-"" M’Pravasi shocked expression that this particular fuck up reached so far down was not a good sign ""-couple with some minor 'accidents' made by various marines on leave resulting in the demise of 50 people on broad daylight in public over minor transgression, this in itself had painted us worse than the already resentful welcoming after our initial assault but not to the point of all out firefights at the mere sight of our troops, what did those 'honors' was an incident involving a vehicle transporting human infants from their learning institutes to their families passing by a gathering of the human politicians and governess T'alíem that was being shot by insurgents and the vehicle was mistaken as their getaway by the responding teams on site given the heat signatures coming from it"".

the look of horror at this event got worse from here ""sense then **EVERY** country in the region has exploded in armed revolt in the remote areas leaving the cities and towns as a sort of neutral ground were you risk which one will take a live from our forces, the worse part in this aside from the numbers of marines found dead days later with a data stick for us to find-"" [playing the file contained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8jI_TaPyC8) ""-is the lost of the following kit"".

""as of right now the recovery of this items is the priority of all forces stationed in the region given the sheer methods employed to acquire them let to 15 whole pods loose their lives by what the forensics had puzzle out to be a sudden application of kinetic force well above the armors thresholds as the organs found showed evidence of blunt force trauma similar of a turox stomp"".

Me'vesa delivered with disdained ""as of right now? defending themselves from a harassment campaign by insurgents and requesting back up and better supplies to recoup the loses in material""

reclining on the chair M’Pravasi covered her face as the news settle, staying like that a minute or two she ordered ""may the empress give her mercy to this two for such a breach of monumental proportions continuously venting oxygen straight into the main core-"" ouch ""- as of this moment governess T'alíem and and'lir are to be remove from their post and strip of their authority get them out of there, try to calm the locals any way you can if the way they reacted to behave in this way keeps up you are to brought them low understood?""

""good may the empress grants you a swift tiding in this storm"" and with that the call ended.

68,ljv8am,HFY,Sun Feb 14 21:22:42 2021,"Every Gun To The Line, Chapter 4","Apologies, this chapter is nowhere near as refined as normally, but I'm really sick at the moment (non-covid, don't worry), so that's thrown off my writing process (I spend most of the gap between chapters writing newer chapters or tweaking the ones I've already done, then properly finish whichever chapter is about to go up from the Friday before they go out). So if you feel like there's a drop in quality this time around, that's why. Sorry. Chapter 5 shouldn't have this same problem at all.

This installment: Foster is involved in a big battle, and Tergelyx gets going on a new operation. I hope you enjoy, in spite of its problems, and if you do spot any problems then do let me know about it.

Comments/questions/complaints are as always appreciated.

*Conowingo Dam, Maryland*

“98, 99, 500. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... ” Tergelyx could hear Curtis’ whispering, barely above audible in the night. There wasn’t actually any real need for him to be so quiet, the nearest enemy was the far side of the river, but noise discipline was a force of habit. Probably a good habit, all things considered.

The pair were in an observation post, along the Human controlled side of the Susquehanna. It had been a few days since they’d engaged the advance elements of the Hekatian forces, and in that time, the Hekatians had caught up. Vehicles were now massing on the other side of the river, as well as troops, and Tergelyx could see every single one of them. That was one thing the Contact War had impressed upon him, that Humans had an absolute skill for building hidden bases, and then using them to great effect. Oh, sure, they had all sorts of scouting vehicles, armoured types, flying types, and so on, just like the Hekatian military did. But where they went further, was in getting *every* soldier to do at least part of it, rather than entrusting it *solely* to the specialists.
.
“90, 91, 92. That’s 592 who’ve just joined right there. Probably more coming up after.” Curtis finished counting

“That’s another battalion’s worth of troops, then.”

“You spot anything interesting, then?”

“Couple more tanks on the right, moving up into fighting positions.” Curtis swung the night vision scope he was using around, looking over where Tergelyx had pointed.

“They’re putting more of those rectangular thingies down. Looks like two sizes.”

“Yeah, those are hardlight bridges. Not actually hardlight, but someone called them that, and everyone refuses to learn the correct term.”

“Let me guess, small ones are for infantry to walk across, large ones for tanks?”

“Yes. They set up the projectors on their side, and just provide power. When it’s all sorted, it’s incredibly stable, and saves them all the hassle of the initial crossing. No need to get anyone over, they can cross however many troops they want, so long as they have the bridges for them.”

“So why don’t they just cross right now?”

“They take a while to set up, because they need to bring up special generators. They can’t just run it off the same reactors they charge power cells off, they need something that puts out consistent supply, otherwise it could fail and everyone falls to their death.”

“So couldn’t we just blow it up, the reactors? Grab a Javelin and fire it?”

“No, the reactors are real hard to destroy, and they bring them in large enough numbers to make it a waste of time.”

“Fuck, wish we had some real artillery by now. Instead we’re just stuck with mortars.” Curtis replied. “We’re well out of our depth.”

“Yeah, I hope the reinforcements are coming along soon.”

“My brother works with tanks, he drives a Leopard, you know, those German tanks they bought ‘cos half the ones we had got blown up in the war. Well, we got phone service back the other day, and he got a text off to me. Says they’re putting *all* the reinforcements in New York. Every last one of them. And that they’ve been running constant flights back and forth, just tossing soldiers and supplies on and coming back with as many women and kids as they can cram inside.”

“Seriously?”

“Yeah. Not got a lack of volunteers wanting to come over, anyway. They put out requests for volunteers to take people in, had to stop after a day because everyone and their dog signed up. But anyway, he said that’s where all the activity is. At least, the activity they talk about on the tv.”

“What do you think it means, then?”

“We’re gonna retreat, and it’ll be a big one. I just hope that we get out of here before they start pouring over.”

The two returned to silence, staring out over the river. Tergelyx watched a barn owl flying around over the Hekatian lines. Several Hekatians stopped their work to watch it, as it circled, before diving to grab a target. Then it lifted itself back off, heading further north. One of the things Tergelyx enjoyed most about Earth was the wildlife. So many species, all so varied. Most Hekatian worlds had the same wildlife forcefully introduced, the Imperium not being the biggest fans of native species sticking around. Getting to see something different felt great to him.

“You think we can win this war?” Curtis broke the silence.

“I don’t know. They’re being a lot smarter about it this time around. It’s how they’d fight with a peer-grade military, like the Trillaxi. Land en masse, land all over the place, break as much as you can before they can reorganise. Take advantage of being able to land infinitely more troops to split them up, prevent them from reinforcing effectively. So that means they’ve grasped how much of a threat Humanity is, and they’re going for a quick blow, knock you out before you go from *threat* to *problem*. If the Imperium loses this war, it’s because they’ve missed something, and have no idea about it.” 

“You’re not good at being comforting, are you Tergelyx.” Curtis took his eyes from the optics for a moment, staring towards Tergelyx with a rather annoyed look on his face.

“If the army wanted optimism, they should have taught me that.”

*Cholsan, North Korea*

“Hekatians are moving! Everyone mount up, they’re making a push!” Lt Stephens ran through the small encampment of his platoon, right as Foster was sitting down to enjoy a ham sandwich. “Come on, move, get in as soon as you can!”

Foster sighed, dropping his sandwich into the chair, and ran to his tank. They’d known the Hekatians had been preparing for a while now, so this wasn’t a *surprise*. Foster just hadn’t expected it to come while he was eating.

“They’re coming, get sabot in now!” Foster growled at Nicholson, before putting his helmet on. Mullins quickly climbed through his own hatch and dropped onto the seat. For his part, Nicholson jumped right into action, opening the ammo door and grabbing a round. Foster glanced out of the turret, seeing the Korean tank units, from both North and South, getting similarly in gear.

“Up.”

“Weber, you ready?”

“Yeah, yeah.” 

Rocket artillery began firing, arcing well over the Human lines and into the midst of the advancing Hekatians. Foster glanced at them through his optics set. The force was massive, hundreds of tanks and IFVs swarming towards them. The Hekatians had overrun much of Northeast China, including the majority of the border, and were gradually pushing towards Beijing.

Foster stood up in his turret, so he could get a better view of the situation. Hekatian artillery began to crash into the ground, but at these ranges, they had very little idea what exactly they were aiming at. Several howitzers boomed in response, firing a counter battery burst. They’d then move themselves, to prevent counter-counter-fire, and then another set of artillery would counter *that*, and it would soon get very confusing.

“Parking us up.” Mullins commented, bringing the tank into a small pre-built firing position. The infantry had laid out a series of trench lines, the first line a little over 2km from Better Not Run’s current position, and the closest just barely beyond the minimum safe distance to not get blown apart by it’s muzzle blasts. Meanwhile, the barrage began to taper off, the rocket artillery units now having to reposition and reload.

The first Hekatian aircraft appeared overhead, bravely flying at low level and maximum speed, to try and flush out the positions of air defence units. One was exceedingly unlucky, exploding in mid air from what Foster could only presume to be a completely accidental hit from an artillery round A few Shilkas fired, giving themselves away and not successfully hitting the targets, but the majority kept silent. The second wave shot overhead, targeting the guns much more precisely. Micro missiles burst out of their wings, blasting the vehicles into pieces and killing their unfortunate crews. This time, however, the perpetrators didn’t get away with it, a torrent of bullets, plus a few dozen missiles of course, reaching up and swatting them down. 

More fighters came overhead, but this time they began circling over the battlefield, waiting for unlucky Human helicopters to prey on. That wasn’t Foster’s problem, though, and so he looked back to the ground.

The Hekatians had begun entering ATGM range, and the infantry let them know about it. There was an initial wave, mostly the cheap, old and weak ones, followed a few seconds later by a second wave of high grade models. When they impacted, the cheap crappy missiles caused shields to flare up, disabling them for the following wave. Foster watched the destruction ripple across the Hekatian force, the lucky ones merely being disabled. But they kept coming.

As if they were attempting to outmatch the earlier rocket barrage, surface to air missiles now began firing at the Hekatian planes. Foster couldn’t see most of them, not at the altitudes they’d be operating at, but he could see the effects, Hekatian planes dropping out of the sky. Then Human jets started flying overhead, MiGs and KF-16s en masse. The ROK jets stayed back, reserving their longer range missiles to deal with any reinforcements. The KPA jets had no such reservations, firing away and speeding in. The MiG-29 pilots especially appeared to be eager, clearly relishing the constant fuel supply that joining UNCO had brought to the country. They broke off into small flights, each composed of a Fulcrum and 2 Floggers, and each with their own individual target.

Foster watched them dance in mid air with the Hekatians. A Flogger would put itself in front of the Hekatian plane, before jerking away, grabbing its attention. The Hekatian would pursue, only to find itself tailed by the other elements of the flight, who opened up with their autocannons, ripping the small fast movers apart. Within a minute, the balance had completely shifted in the skies, Humans having regained control once more.

In that minute, though, the ground forces had only gained on Foster, and they were beginning to fire on the lead trenches. The infantry inside, by this point, had largely retreated to lines further behind, guaranteeing safety.. A nearby Bradley fired off a TOW, and the KPA tanks used their own ATGMs, filling the battlefield with yet another wall of missiles.

“Rangefinder tells me they’re at 3 clicks. Weber, fire the second they cross 2.5, that's when everyone else will.” Foster spoke over the intercom, quickly performing a few last minute prayers in his head. A second wave of rocket artillery began to fire, albeit one much smaller than the first, in order to prevent friendly fire.

“Will do.” The range counter ticked down and down, until Foster heard the great *thump* of Better Not Run’s 120mm. All down the line, tank guns joined in, in something approaching Napoleonic-era rifle . Hekatian tanks exploded, shields briefly flaring as the vehicle they protected disappeared behind them. IFVs were annihilated, the lack of central control on who shot what meaning many took multiple shells at once.

The KPA tanks then did something Foster wasn’t expecting whatsoever. They *charged*, speeding out and over crossings in the trench line. Their machine guns began blasting at the Hekatian infantry, who were now beginning to disembark to clear the trenches.

“The fuck are they doing? They’re going to get killed!” Weber yelled, waiting for another sabot round to be loaded.

The Hekatian tanks held their ground, their IFVs backing them up. Plasma blasts rocketed around, and the Human shells kept on coming. That standing of ground proved to be somewhat of a fatal error, though, as a squadron of Su-25’s sped over, dropping a long load of bombs and blanketing much of the Hekatian force in fire and shrapnel. Foster could see A-10s following closely behind, each splitting off to seek and destroy the survivors. They waited for the smoke and dust to clear, then began firing their infamous cannon at surviving tanks, in long bursts to crack the shields. The missiles followed, pairs to make sure the target was *really* dead.

From his hatch position, Foster could see the infantry in the trenches in front, making a counter-attack. Plasma rifles may easily have beaten bullets, but in the tight corners of a trench system, Foster knew that the side with the most grenades won. Judging by the explosions, he had a good idea of who that was.

“I can’t get a clean shot, christ!” Foster looked back to the tanks. The KPA were now fully intermingled with the Hekatians, tank barrels swinging left and right, ramming IFVs at full speed, and all in all creating total chaos. It was impossible to fire without hitting a friend, but Foster knew they had to keep up the support.

“All tanks, advance! We can’t get a clear shot from here, we need to move into it!” Lt Stephens shouted on the radio, and Foster was more than happy to comply. 

The situation was at this point utterly incomprehensible, tanks moving all over the place, any pretence of a cohesive Hekatian line shattered. Weber fired another round, obliterating an IFV that had the misfortune of being on the outskirts of the chaos, and therefore a safe target. Nicholson fetched another one, feeding it in rapidly. 

Back in the sky, several Apaches flew over. Their crews attempted to rationalise the situation, make sense of what they were seeing, but decided the best thing to do was just fire off some bursts with the chain gun and hope for the best. Explosive rounds wrecked the few intact shields, destroyed anti-tank teams, and started fires, which the KPA ruthlessly exploited.

The sounds of explosions began to quieten down, still unbearably loud if you had no protection, but just a little less deafening. Then some less. And Foster suddenly found himself passing through a field of destroyed vehicles with no one to shoot at. The KPA paused, as if they were catching their breath. Hekatian vehicle crews began bailing out, sticking their hands up. 

“Keep us going, Mullins, I’ve got an idea.”

“Foster, Foster, what the fuck are you doing? Why are you carrying on?” Lt Stephens shouted over the platoon radio.

“They won’t be expecting a counter-attack so soon. The KPA have handled the majority of the work, we’re still intact and ready to fight. If we press on now, we could easily get all the way to the border.”

There was a pause, as if the Lt was trying to comprehend what Foster had just said. Then the reply. 

“When this gets us in Hell, I assure you, I will find you in the lake of fire, and personally kick your ass. But, let’s try it anyway. Scott, come on!” Lt Stephens ordered SFC Scott to join in as well, bringing the whole platoon on. Hekatian plasma artillery continued to rain down, but it was sporadic, lacking in guidance.

From Foster’s hatch, he could see what he’d started. K2s, K1s, they joined the charge, training their guns forward and their commanders giving small thumbs up. A couple Bradleys pushed out of their secure areas and quickly racing to pick up troops to secure nearby towns. The Apaches flew escort overhead, a few Hellfires rocketing away to eliminate the Hekatian artillery.

The formation rapidly grew into an arrowhead shape, Foster’s platoon at the front of it, and more tanks speeding up to catch up. When everyone was in line, they set off, barreling between destroyed tanks and towards the Yalu river. There was a thin Hekatian defensive line, nothing more than a few foxholes and tents. The occupants didn’t even try to put up a fight, getting out and surrendering to a team of ROK infantry, who disembarked to march them away.

“They haven’t even put down their bridges! Come on, right across!” Lt Stephens yelled, driving towards a Hekatian hardlight bridge. Foster followed, and they crossed, finding themselves surrounded by the craters of Human artillery shells. A few Hekatian guns were destroyed, suggesting they still hadn’t learnt the value of shoot-and-scoot. *Pity, let’s hope they continue not to learn it.* Just over a nearby hill, Foster spotted another Hekatian artillery piece, this one attempting to use it’s barrel for a direct shot against his tank.

“Weber, over that hill, just on our right. Get him.” Better Not Run’s gun fired, a sabot round quickly providing additional ventilation to the crew of the artillery piece. Flames began to appear from it, and the crew bailed out, before it quickly exploded. “Perfect shot.”

“Hold position, everyone, we’re going to let the Koreans catch up. We’ve done brilliantly, and we may have just turned the entire front right here. Get yourselves some rest, food, and maintenance done, tomorrow we’ll cross and smash into the Hekatians’ flanks.”

Mullins pulled the tank to a stop, parking it off to the side of a road. Foster sat down in his chair, finally relaxing and untensing himself. His stomach began to rumble, and he realised he hadn’t eaten in close to an hour. Then he remembered why.

“Fuck, I dropped my sandwich back over there.”

*Conowingo, Maryland*

“Tergelyx, get over to the command building. Something’s up, and the whole platoon’s been invited.” Tergelyx was cleaning his armour outside of his billet when he heard Lieutenant Bower right behind him. 

“Understood Lt, I’ll be right over.” He laid the pieces of his suit down on his roll mat, making sure to not let them touch the ground. When even just a tiny bit of gravel found it’s way inside, you would *absolutely* know about it until you got the opportunity to take it off again Pulling himself to his feet, he made his way up after the Lt. 

“Before we get there, I do have to ask, are you getting along with 1 section alright? No problems working together?” Bower made sure to walk at a reasonable pace as she talked to Tergelyx, not letting him fall behind as most Humans did by accident.

“No, Lt. They’re very good people.”

“Is that a serious answer, or a ‘I want to please my boss’ answer?”

“Serious, serious.”

“Well that’s good to hear. I wish we could have had more time to get you to know them before we parachuted you in, but I’ve not heard any complaints from Heppell, and considering they pulled that rescue stunt for you, I think it’s all good.”

“Did you tell them to do that?”

“No, Heppell ran off and the rest followed. Frankly I was convinced you were dead, but you’re tougher than I expected you to be. Oh, and one last thing.” Bower stopped, withdrawing a small object from a pocket and holding it in their palm. 

Tergelyx looked at it, slightly baffled by it. The object looked like the sort of thing you used to open a Human car up with, one of the switchblade types with a little metal key you could flip out if the remote stopped working. Aside from the button to flip out the metal bit, there was only one button on this, with a little image of a lock shattering printed onto it. Finally, there were two small LEDs positioned in the frame just above the larger button, which Tergelyx assumed were status indicators.

“This is officially the Infantry Ultra Mobile Silent Entry System, but that’s a shit name, so I just call it the skeleton key. We got this delivered today, it’s the only one our platoon has. I don’t know how they did it, some stuff they must have figured out while reverse engineering all your stuff, but it reconfigures itself to open up whichever lock it’s presented with. Works with basically every standard civilian lock, except those ugly round ones. Allows us to open up a front door so we can get in without breaking shit, that sort of thing.”

“That’s… something that could be easily abused. How do you stop someone invading pri-”

“Yes, yes, I know. It is extremely easy to abuse. Which is why I’m giving it to you. I can trust my soldiers, absolutely, but I cannot trust my soldiers *when they are drunk*, or when they think they’ve got a good idea for a joke. I mean, god forbid Cooper ever had it, she’s like a magpie. But you, you’re least likely to get caught up in some daft scheme.”

Bower put their hand out, offering the skeleton key to Tergelyx. He took it, holding it firm in his hand, resolving to hide it in his rucksack as soon as this briefing was over.

“Keep this safe, if it goes missing, tell the sergeant and she’ll kill whoever took it. If you just lost it, she’ll kill you, and then I’ll have every inch of ground from here to DC scoured until we get it back. Don’t let anyone force you to use it outside of combat, regardless of rank.”

“I, uhhh… thank you Lt.” 

“No problem.” Bower set off again, this time a lot closer to their destination. 

Thepair approached the Headquarters building, a former bar that had been appropriated and slightly renovated. The tables and chairs had been removed and piled up outside.. Inside, Tergelyx’s entire platoon had gathered, leaning up against walls or the bar. Tergelyx recognised his immediate commanders amongst those inside, but some officers, standing on the stage and waiting to address the platoon, were definitely *new* faces.

“And that’s the last one, sir. We’re all here.” Bower reported in, as they walked over to the other officers.

“Excellent, Lt.” One of the officers began talking, stepping up to get everyone’s attention. “I’ll be brief, we’re going to get a proper package handed to each of you by the end of the day. I’m Captain Simms, Royal Engineer’s, and I’m here since I have an important mission. Should you have paid enough attention to your maps, you should have noticed a nuclear power station up the river from here. Peach Bottom the Americans called it, terrible name, but that’s besides the point. Was in operation when the invasion landed, workers evacuated and, for whatever reason, didn’t properly shut it down.”

“So it’s still running as if everything’s fine, just no one’s there to keep an eye on it?” Sergeant Fletcher asked the first question.

“Yes, and it’s a problem. By every indication, it’s safe, but we don’t want to find it suddenly melting down. Worse, we don’t want the Hekatians to fiddle with it and cause trouble intentionally. There’s more than enough civvies with radiation poisoning already, we don’t need to start adding battle groups to that figure. As a result, I’ve been ordered to bring a group of engineers, and some nuclear specialists, to properly disable the reactor. Unfortunately, we need an escort, and the units up at Holtwood are too busy to actually spare enough. So, I’m going to need your platoon to help us cross, and clear the facility as we do our work. Any questions?”

“How are we planning on crossing?” Private Forrester asked, a confused look covering his face.

“We’re going to bring assault boats up to the river, and paddle them across in the night, when the Hekatians aren’t expecting anything. Same thing for the way back.”

“Support?”

“We’ve been able to grab a few 155mm’s off the Americans, they’ll be providing a barrage if we need cover. They’re tied into our tacpad network, so section commanders, you’ll be able to organise their fire.” Captain Simms looked around, trying to find anyone else with a question. “If that’s everything, then you’re free to go. Zero hour is midnight, tomorrow, we’ll have maps of the power station, and all the relevant special equipment distributed to you all by sunset. Dismissed.”

Tergelyx’s platoon scattered, walking away and setting off to their tents. He set off too, catching up with Corporal Heppell. They walked together, both mulling it over, before Heppell broke the silence.

“Your thoughts?”

“We’re absolutely going to come back glowing bright green, aren’t we.” Cooper replied.

“100%.”

*Peach Bottom Road Boat Launch, Pennsylvania*

“Tergelyx, you ever rowed before?” Curtis asked, as he helped pull 1 Section’s assigned boat down to the water.

“What’s rowing?” A chuckle went up from the rest of 1 Section at Tergelyx’s response. But that didn’t answer his question. 

“Alright, Hekatians are definitely sitting in the middle, LS3s next to them.” Lt Bower overheard their conversation. 

Nearby, K-9 was trotting along, a quick functions test in progress. It had been stripped of its cargo, keeping weight to nothing more than the robot itself, as it would be valuable for watching flanks and scouting out areas. Lieutenant Bower looked at their watch, after replying. 

“10 minutes to go. Alright, quick drill, gas masks on!” The assorted soldiers rapidly pulled their helmets off, fiddling with their pouches and withdrawing their gas masks from inside. Meanwhile, Tergelyx, along with Jasaly and Nadishanpurm, simply flipped a switch on their helmets, activating their filters. The experience of being knocked out with CS gas, during the Contact War was not something he had particularly enjoyed, which was why the Humans had been so quick to add it to the armour of their allies. The Human soldiers continued putting their gas masks on, hands moving in a manner formed by many hours of practice. 

“All good? Properly sealed, no problems? Good. Now, get them off, and get on the boats. We’re going now, let’s accelerate the schedule a little.” Captain Simms spoke up. He, like his engineers, carried a large rucksack, presumably carrying whatever it was they needed. “1 section plus Sergeant Fletcher, you’ll take my Corporals, Martin and Butler, boat on the left. 2 section, I’ll go with you, boat in the centre. 3rd plus Lt Bower and Pvt Palmer, Lt Russell will go with you. I want us in the water by zero hour.”

Tergelyx deactivated his filters, climbing into his assigned boat and taking a seat. Around him, his section began to board, getting paddles out and preparing to move. The pattern repeated, before all 3 boats were pushed away by those engineers lucky enough not to be sent upon this mission. 

The soldiers immediately began turning the boats as they moved through the water, the plan calling for the shoreline to be followed closely before turning directly towards the station, minimising the risk of discovery. It felt rather weird to be sat in the middle of a boat, as people row around you, and to have absolutely no input in what was going on. Tergelyx was completely putting his life in the hands of the soldiers around him, in a way he could never have expected.

They had made it about a kilometre up the riverbank, before a bright light suddenly illuminated the area to their south. This threw the assorted soldiers into panic, paddling even quicker. But Tergelyx knew better.

“They’re not searchlights! They’re testing their bridges.” He hissed over the radio network.

“Tergelyx, you sure?” Lieutenant Bower shot back, uncertainty in their voice. 

“He’s right, they’ll flip them off, flip another one down the line on. It’s meant to confuse whoever they’re attacking, make them think the attack is due any moment. Watch.” Jasaly replied. Sure enough, the beam of light disappeared, followed a few seconds later by a beam further south. 

“Alright, good. We’re clear then. Keep going everyone.” The rest of the journey went smoothly, the boats drawing nearer and nearer. Through his night vision equipment, Tergelyx began to see Hekatian sentries patrolling. 

“5 sentries on foot, they don’t seem to have spotted us. What should we do, Lt?”

“1 section, eliminate them, proceed to your objectives afterwards. 3 section, change of plan, move to Paper Mill Road, prepare to engage reinforcements. 2 section, orders remain unchanged.” Lt Bower ordered.Tergelyx’s boat came up against the station’s sea wall, Private Forrester reaching out and grabbing on to keep the boat in place. An improvised anchor was tossed off the side, and 1 section began climbing off. 

“Delta fireteam, go get those two on the road to the right. Knives and dump them in the river, only shoot if they shoot first. Charlie, we’ll take the 3 who’ve just gone behind those buildings, ambush them when they come around. Engineers, hold position until we clear them. Move!” Corporal Heppell helped Tergelyx out of the boat as he talked, the rest of the section making quick time towards cover. Further down, Tergelyx could see the other sections disembarking.

Private Cooper withdrew a small tablet, issuing orders to K-9, who she’d turned on before exiting the boat. He responded immediately, turning towards the wall and preparing to jump. Then, it lunged forwards, grabbing hold of the edge of the wall with it’s front legs, and scrabbling against it with it’s back. K-9 then pulled itself up, before trotting along behind Cooper. She pressed another set of buttons, and it then followed her along towards the 2 defenders on the road.

“I’m not going to lie, I just wanted to see if it could do it itself or not.” Tergelyx heard her say over the radio. *You risked all that expensive kit like that, for fun?*

By the time Tergelyx reached the building where the rest of Charlie fireteam were stacked up, the guards had nearly come fully around. With a series of hand signals, Heppell assigned each of the fireteam a guard, excusing himself of the bloody business of actually *killing* the Hekatians. Tergelyx nodded back, pulling his issued combat knife from his webbing and moving as close to the corner as he could. 

Curtis and Camp pulled out their own bayonet knives, short stubby knives. They weren’t ordinary though, no, they had been modified, just like their rifles. When in bayonet form, they generated a thin plasma sheath around the blade, improving it’s power a hundredfold. Of course, it’s power source was solely from the rifle’s supply, but it was deadly regardless when they knew where to put it.

Camp took the lead now, sticking his fingers up in an unmistakable countdown. *5, 4, 3, 2, 1,* and then Tergelyx found himself dashing towards the middle man. His target began to turn, but then Tergelyx was upon him, plunging the knife deep into his helmet, right where their lower eyes would be. It wasn’t *particularly* a nice way to go, and the less Tergelyx thought about how much research the Humans had put into finding the best way to stab his species, the better.

“Alright, let’s move them.” Curtis began dragging his target towards the water, and Tergelyx followed. He got there first, being much better equipped to handle the weight of a fully laden armoured trooper than the others.

“All targets eliminated, Lt. Coast is clear.”

“Understood, well done. Let's get this going, and out of here before someone notices.”

&amp;#x200B;

For most of his life, Cookie had never seen his father out of tailored suits. To be seen in anything but the height of fashion would be nothing more than dishonorable to the family name. Sure, they weren’t related to \_those\_ Kennedys, but as a Kennedy \_Ryan\_ Kennedy had been raised \_the right way\_.

&amp;#x200B;

There was a reason he had no fashion sense other than button down shirts and khakis.

&amp;#x200B;

So when he was sitting down at dinner, 5 minutes early as is proper, he had to force down his shock as he saw his father, a slightly balding man past his prime and with just enough paunch to be seen as a beer gut instead of healthy weight, walk in with what looked like honest to god \_chainmail\_ under his tailored suit coat and a leather vest that looked like something out of Dark Souls. It was only military training and 17 years of living with these people kept the shock from showing on his face. And then his mother walked in wearing something that came out of the Witcher.

&amp;#x200B;

Suit pants creased harshly enough to slice bread and what looked like a faux brass corset over a purple blouse. A single almost pauldron like accessory sat on her right shoulder with the symbol of the Shil’vati Imperium etched onto the metal. As she moved to sit down, Cookie could tell that the metal wasn’t a solid piece, but instead probably some fancy Purp material science creating a fabric that shimmered and looked like brass. At this, he could only school himself to raise an eyebrow.

&amp;#x200B;

The ex-Pilot himself only wore plain khakis, dress shoes and a white button down shirt. A pair of worn aviators sat in his breast pocket, relics from his time in the air, and the flight jacket his wing bought one week on leave, the patch with his Naval Aviation wings had been sadly absent from the beautiful coat for years. “I… I see you have reevaluated your fashion choices?” He begins, trying to snap his eyes from each stranger fashion choice to instead look his Mother and Father in their eyes.

&amp;#x200B;

“Ah yes.” His Mother began, “As the new order has settled in, we believed it was time to update our choices to more fit what they expect. For a smoother transition of power, of course. And for the good of the family name.”

&amp;#x200B;

\_That explained the Imperium flag flying where old glory used to proudly sit.\_ Cookie thought sardonically, “So this was the ending choice?” He asked out loud, “It seems odd. I don’t believe I’ve seen anything like it outside of propaganda pieces I see occasionally.”

&amp;#x200B;

“Your mother and I have been informed from a good source that such clothing is considered high fashion in the Imperium. We merely added a human touch to it. We have encouraged others in our group to adopt the same. We have already been approached with positions on the regional council due to our efforts.” Cookie’s father stated proudly. “No matter what, our family name will be remembered.

&amp;#x200B;

\_As traitors.\_ Cookie thought. “I have something to say as well then, I have made the decision to join the Imperium’s Patrol. I am shipping out to training at the end of the week.”

&amp;#x200B;

To anyone else the announcement was met with no reaction, but to someone who had grown up reading the microexpressions in these people’s faces and who had made a name for himself recognizing the roundels of jets at distances of kilometers, it was like the pair had dropped their jaws in shock. He barely suppressed a smile and they knew it.

&amp;#x200B;

“Are you, I mean, of course. I am glad you are doing your part to further the Kennedy name. It is good you have joined us in embracing the Imperium. We shall be a guiding light for those less fortunate to not follow in our path as quickly. In fact, we gave our support for furthering Shil’vati control over the healthcare system just this week.” His mother said before she and his father began explaining just how accomplished they were being and how it would be so much nicer if their eldest son would get involved.

&amp;#x200B;

\_Less fortunate.\_ Cookie scoffed, \_How quickly your tune changed. Couple of years ago and you were all for repealing ACA.\_

&amp;#x200B;

Cookie tuned them out, letting them brag as he ate his food. After the invasion, beef had become a touch rarer due to the fact that most farmland was in rebel control, but somehow his parents had found a way to acquire some grade A steak. \_Wonder how much it cost to get this. Probably could feed a whole bunch of folks with this.\_

&amp;#x200B;

The Shil’vati, during their work at rebuilding and in some cases \_building\_ infrastructure, had set up a robust chain of food banks and soup kitchens around the world. Food was no better than army rations, but it was free, filling and nutritious. Some regions had even contacted rebel groups and got these places designated “safe zones” where anyone could get shelter, food and medical aid. Cookie worked at one hauling crates a couple years ago because the pension he got \_from\_ the Shil’vati because of the 773 liberating officer was running a bit thin and he was not willing to get a \_loan\_ from his parents. That’s just inviting them \_back\_ into his life and when he left for the Naval Academy at 17. He only appeared at dinner to say goodbye.

&amp;#x200B;

He watched silently as they prattled on about their latest accomplishments. How they were friends with whatshisname, how they courted favor with whatsherface, how they sold out someone with rebellions thoughts to the Interior. It took everything in his body to not stand up and leave at that. Cookie was never one for revolution for old America. It lost the war and he accepted that. But he was \_firmly\_ neutral in this stance. He wouldn’t help the rebels but he sure as \_hell\_ won’t be helping the Interior.

&amp;#x200B;

The body buried in limestone in the ruins of a parking garage proved that point quite well.

&amp;#x200B;

\_773 wasn’t anything to brag about.\_

&amp;#x200B;

NEXT CHAPTER

Short chapter, I know, but I wasn't really feeling the scene so I decided to cut it before I ended up losing interest with the whole story. Next chapter deals with the pair shipping out and what comes with it. I'll be going into who they signed up with, what their duties will be, and all that fun stuff.

Probably won't do a *full* training arc like SSB did, but rather a montage style thing like I did in ""So Help Me God"".

Anyway, I hope you enjoy the chapter. Next will probably be out quicker because I'm not slamming my head against a scene I don't like.",/r/HFY/comments/ln8040/top_lasgun_family_dinner_a_sexy_space_babes_fanfic/,31
94,lnab5k,HFY,Fri Feb 19 09:51:40 2021,Alien-nation Chapter 12: Doubt,"# For those just joining

It's a SSB-verse story- it is a new 'verse in HFY based off /u/BlueFishCake's 'verse, in a similar manner to how Jenkinsverse and Deathworlders have their own spin-offs.  


* This story becomes a sort of gender-bend on certain classic sci-fi tropes, (while also trying to be grounded in pragmatism and less reliant on certain HFY tropes). It explores the occupation and subjugation of Earth from the perspective of a young male teenager named Elias, who grows up in the occupation period and trying to find a way to free his planet in addition to his own grapple with his own identity. 

\[[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/lbtr3m/aliennation_chapter_1_emergence/)\], \[[Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/lkf8kq/aliennation_chapter_11_running_in_circles/)\] \[Next\]

**Author's Notes**

It’s time to bust some tropes and set up some new ones! (There’s always a ‘we conquer them with kung-fu!’ and ‘We infiltrate as service industry workers!’ Thought we’d actually bring that up at a meeting.)

We're in for a longer than usual chapter today, and I've been working on building up a decently-sized buffer against further blocks in publishing. I've got a lot of content in the works, including some villains and twists that people weren't expecting (and some that the exceptionally bright among you were- I see you over there, you wizard!) 

**Chapter 12: Doubt**

“...Next, you strike with *all* your ki, and you shout! That will focus your-” I tuned the instructor back out again for what must have been the twentieth time. I felt ridiculous. I *looked* ridiculous. It had only just occurred to me that we had actual veterans to teach me proper hand-to-hand combat skills, and here I was wearing a gi, on a reed mat, watching a fat man in a mall outlet, and how that translated into ‘putting your mind into doing anything.’ The guy claimed to be everything you could care to name, but insisted we all call him ‘sensei.’ Whatever. Where was [Xu Xiaodong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xu_Xiaodong) when I needed him?

“Elias! You are new here. Please, demonstrate how to punch, *with your mind*!” Fighting the temptation to write off all Martial arts as a mistake, I faked a punch, got told I lacked discipline, and promised I’d ‘work on it.’ Whatever. One day and I’d seen enough. So much for total honesty, too.

Half an hour later and having left the ‘dojo’ behind forever, I was mentally kicking myself for not just *asking* some of the war veterans for actual hand-to-hand combat. It hadn’t been a complete waste of time- rubber knives seemed a good way to start practicing with real ones, for example. I’d broach the subject at the meeting tonight.

We had our first meeting since the bar fight at Lucky’s at George and Verns’ house. Theirs was a pretty modest single-story house, smaller than the neighbourhood standard but well-built as befitted the plumber/handyman. George had also promised to show me something cool, and had come back with something about the size of a breadbox and shaped more or less like a candy corn piece with the tip bit off, and a pair of antennae. George shifted it in his hands and turned it over.

“Careful,” my friend warned, handing it to me, then adjusting his mask. George, or ‘G-man,’ had a nicer mask than either of us. A mix of respirator mask and goggles, his offered actual functionality rather than just hiding his face. I noted that and thought to keep that in mind if I was going to ever update my mask. 

Turned my eyes down at what he’d handed me, I read *Front towards enemy* on what I’d thought was the ‘bottom.’ That made me reorient my imagination of how the weapon might work and suddenly it snapped into place. “Is that a landmine?”

“Sort of,” he said. “It’s overkill for humans. I’m not sure what it’ll do to aliens. But, we have to test it in the field as we have only one. At the least, it’ll piss them off.”

“Where did you even find that?” I don’t think he was expecting a real answer, so he ignored it and continued on. My bet was we’d traded one of my bombs for it- and that was probably a fair trade. Homemade explosives could perform various tasks like infrastructure damage, that this might struggle to accomplish.

“We’ve got to kick this into overdrive. Right now we’re scoring maybe a one or two on their threat level. An overgrown firecracker that scrapes up their paint? A bar fight? All that does is disrupt *their* illusion of total control. Worse, Dad went downtown and apparently they are walking around without armour is now super common. When we had them scared enough that they were always wearing armour at least we could all see them as an occupier. But when they start fraternising, what do you think the libs will do?” George asked, echoing his father for a moment.

“Libs?” Asked Vaughn, eyes narrowing. I sensed the sudden spike in tension, but George didn’t and kept running his mouth.

“Yeah, the fuckin’ libs, man, they rolled over fast. Didn’t have no faith in humanity anyways before, and now they’ve got a fucking space-saviour they can bow and scrape after. You let the Eggplants start fraternising, and they’ll find allies, too. Imagine how hard it’ll be sneaking around when the neighbourhood starts sympathising with the Purps.” His mouth moved but it was his father’s words. I remembered them from a town meeting a few months ago, when he and a neighbour had nearly come to blows.

Vaughn didn’t say anything but he did give George a rough shove, who for his part let out a yelp- “what the *fuck*, man?” His voice broke a little and he grabbed the table. I stepped back, a little nervous about roughhousing while holding an anti personnel landmine.

“Save it-” I tried to speak up. No one ever listened to me- but Vaughn took it as an out to whirl on me.  “Look, I- I don’t really get the division, but we can think about how this might play out objectively-” I said, speaking fast.

“Shut up.” Vaughn said simply. I did. Silence echoed in the space afterwards, with all of us looking amongst one another for who would break the awkward silence. And me, holding the landmine. Finally, to break the ten second tension, I piped up again which seemed to irk Vaughn. 

“We’ve been looking for a way to hurt them. This-” I pointed at the landmine in my hands. “-might just do it, and we have George and his family to thank for making that happen. If it doesn’t work out, then tough shit, we’ try something else. We think of and find ways to make them hurt. If they are out of armour, then that scenario is both good *and* bad. Good because we’ll hit them with the stuff we’ve been using and this time it’ll hurt them. George, go tell your dad I’ve got an idea about the current situation, see what he thinks of me talking first. Vaughn, are you okay with that?”

The two looked at me and then nodded their heads at the same time. They may not like one another or had wildly differing views about their fellow man, but when it came down to hurting the Shil’vati, I could bring at least them to something resembling unity. I still didn’t know what Vaughn got out of it except some sick sense of enjoying death. He was an animal optimised for power and violence, but he was our animal. George was a ball of resentment and a boy looking to become a man through his father’s approval. Looking back at that moment I realised later in life that it was the first time I’d ever taken control of a situation before it had gotten out of hand. I didn’t even realise it but it was one of the first times people looked up to me for leadership, even if it was just our little group of peers. 

A few minutes later and we did a headcount in their house; we came up to a few missing, mostly fringe members and all accounted for, but had told their ‘representatives’ that they were too nervous to show up in person anymore. 

“Alright,” Verns said in the common room. “*The Emperor's* got a good point about this recent development I think everyone ought to hear.” Everyone quieted down to hear me. 

I first spun this development of missing people who were too frightened to show up as a positive for security and explained how cells would work. Several heads, many of them sporting visible bandages or bruises, nodded along. I then came to my *actual* point: “They’re out of armour and wandering around like stupid tourists. We have bombs. We have guns. We have men and women, and a temporary base of operations. But with them wandering around, we’ve also now got a new series of opportunities to attack them. Many have now started shipping out here when they’re on leave since we’re a ‘green zone.’” A lot of grumbling at that announcement. “That means there are Marines here who are out of their armour with their guard down, ranging far from their usual posts on unfamiliar ground. We’re going to look for attacks of opportunities now, to force them back into their armour or to at least have one fewer area to go and act like they own the place. We make the state red. We won’t let them give everyone here the illusion that this is anything *other* than an occupation.” More people nodding along, now. Time to put forward my idea. “An ambush of soldiers on leave is probably our safest bet, in terms of guarantee to hurt only Shil’vati.” Silence. I scrambled for Plan B.“There are also events that are coming up that have civil authorities present. It’s also my suggestion we look into targeting one of them. A casualty event that costs them where they’ll feel it and can’t help but react- their nobility. We may provoke them into overreacting. Maryland was a bloodbath, but that incident at the hospital turned them from Yellow Zone to Red Zone from their massive retaliation. Even the cops came down on the right side on that one and joined up with the outlaws. Word I’ve got on the pirate radio is that it was their nobility that were at the root of the cause. We can shoot Marines all day, but we need to start taking shots at their Nobility, who have started cropping up around the state to make little statements and platitudes.” I didn’t mention that the Governess herself had done so at my own middle school. Now I had their attention, anyways. It was a bold plan, and I knew it. High-risk, but high-reward. If we could turn our little state into a copy of Maryland, we’d functionally have achieved success beyond our wildest dreams.

The bikers shifted a little, probably unhappy about the idea of joining up with cops. Before I could think of a way to tackle that, Vaughn- or, ‘Vendetta,’ as he was introduced to everyone here, cut in. “-There’s an event coming up over at the local private high school, Saint Michael’s.” I felt my blood turn to ice and my stomach churn at the thought of bombing my old school for some reason. “We can infiltrate as wait staff and poison the food or drink with cyanide at the event. It doesn’t matter who bites or drinks. Someone dying with a frothy mouth is going to set relations between Shil’vati and Humans back a ways at an event designed to make them BFF’s? Perfect way to set them pointing fingers at each other. A bomb works, too.”

I'd just gotten people to start listening to me, to start following, and then he'd pull this. Whatever 'this' was. I tried to pull him aside and away from the centre of the room to just talk with him. He wouldn’t budge, staring me down. I let go and faced him, mask-to-mask. “You want us to go in there, steal wait staff uniforms? We don’t even know what company’s doing the catering so we can’t even snag them. That’s a really, really, really risky plan.” The logistics alone and the risks were making my brain hurt. 

“It’s waiting, it’s easy, and it’s *right there*.” He turned away from me and gestured to the room and started to strut, trying to make his point. “We get in that close and there’s no way anyone’s testing the drink between when we poison it and when they’re drinking. Or, alternatively we can bomb the whole venue. We’ve got enough bombs to bring the whole roof down, set some timers and get out.”

“And then what? Our bombs are designed to be easily defused. Even if it succeeds, it’s a school event. You’d be targeting children.” I thought of us standing at that mandatory attendance to welcome that Shil’vati Exchange student, Natalie, and the Governess Mistriva. Frankly, these were far from the worst of the Marines' and Interior's excesses on Earth. The Governess supposedly even stood up for us at a few turns and took a lot of flak doing so, getting assigned to Earth even though we were a backwater on the far arm of a spiral galaxy. Heck, the kids didn’t get a say in what events they went to- in what way were they guilty and deserving of death? “If we poison them, then the body count of a few humans and no aliens would not help us, at all. We can’t control who bites into what.” I kept trying to visualise it actually working and couldn’t see us both pulling it off and getting away. I could see how easily they’d twist the story and twist public opinion away from us after the fact, though. Lots of risk with a very uncertain payoff.

“Oh, right, I’m sorry,” Vaughn sarcastically intoned. “We can plan to kill a half dozen or more with a bomb and that’s okay because...bombs are very accurate and precise?” He snorted sarcastically. “This isn’t Robin Hood, we don’t have ‘a code,’ we do whatever’s practical."" Turning again toward the room, he asked: ""What do we want? We want dead aliens and collaborators!” I saw a few nodding along, and felt helpless as I watched. I also saw some people looked uneasy. He turned toward me and jabbed a finger in my chest. “What, worried you’ll be killing all your rich family’s rich friends, 'Little Emperor'?” Vaughn asked, glaring at me. “All your old school buddies will be there, too. What’s the part you can’t stomach about killing traitors? Is it that it means admitting all your old friends that you’re so desperate to get back to are traitors, or is it that you’re just like them?” 

Something in me snapped. I grabbed his finger before he could jerk it back. His eyes went wide as I pulled it over his head- I’d never realised it, but we were of about equal height. He started to move back but I put a foot behind his, and he stumbled and fell backwards. I had his arm above his head on the wall now, and our eyes met from behind our masks.

“There’s a difference, between killing people, and killing those…things.” It would cross a line that couldn’t be un-crossed. “You. Me. Outside!” My heart was hammering in my ears. I took a breath to try and calm myself, the way Dr. Harriet had told me. In. Out. In. Out. I’d just challenged him, the way they’d ‘taught’ the guy who had misused one of the bombs we’d made. It was childish. It was stupid. It had probably just cost me whatever credibility I’d built. In. Out. In. Out. I saw George tag along to start following us, silent.

The attendees parted for us, and I went out the side door onto the back lawn. When I turned on my heel and released Vaughn’s finger, his closed fist caught me square on my mask’s right side and slammed it into my cheekbone. I staggered back but he was already following up with a clumsy, overly choreographed kick. I twisted away from it and tried to catch his heel, but he’d already stepped into it to close the gap. 

All my life I’d fought my older sister until the bruises had been too many for her to hide or excuse away, and then they’d sent her to a private boarding school as ‘punishment.’ I jumped back as he snagged his fingers on the last clean collared I owned- a hand-me-down, and tugged, tearing the old fabric along the seams. I let it slip off and felt the world go red as the summer air hummed and buzzed around me. I felt invigorated, I felt *alive* as now it was me advancing on him. 

Vaughn was wrong about me. He might have no morals, no principles, but it had been my rage that fuelled me for everything. It was what got me up in the morning. It was what kept my nose pressed into the book looking for ways to be effective in hurting people. Right at that moment, he was my enemy. I formed a fist and took the first step toward him. He swung just like Jacqueline- overly eager to put the hurt on someone. I stopped the advance to lean back and then leaned back in as soon as the punch was out of energy. I went low for his stomach with a right-handed punch of my own. He coughed in surprise as I caught him in the ribs, sliding the hand in under his extended arm. I followed up the way my dad taught me once. I tucked my fists in close and twisted my hips the other direction, hitting him with my left elbow in the jaw. He went down sucking air with gritted teeth, and I dropped on top of him with my knees, then rose as he clutched at his side and one hand up. 

“Stay down and listen-“ he tried to rise so I gave him a shove with the heel of my boot, sending him flopping forward on all fours. I stomped after him. “-and listen well. You and I were both there for that first bombing. I carried out the first strike. You’re right. I’m probably risking more than you are just by being here. So don’t you *dare* doubt my commitment to this cause.” Deep breaths. In. Out. In. Out. “So. You done?”

“Yeah?” He asked, wiping at his jaw and rolling over. “What’s the difference? What are you going to do, when a cop chases any of you down? You think he’s gonna just ‘be cool’ and let you walk away when he’s got you dead to rights with explosive residue all over your palms? No, I’m sure he’s got mouths to feed and doesn’t want to lose his job. Not wanting to go back on the job hunt when a lot of people are on public welfare these days isn’t a crime against humanity. That cop would shoot you without a second thought, and he’d be less guilty of betraying humanity than these rich fuck friends of yours are.”

“They’re not my friends, *Vendetta*. I wasn’t treated any better there than I am at Talay. The only reason I’m shooting this down is that I accept the idea of human losses when we’re *sure* we’re going to get a kill on a Shil’vati. We swing at everything that comes by, we won’t look like anything other than monsters. We don’t shoot a gun into the air or into a crowded purple-filled human bar and roll the dice that it hits a Shil’vati instead of a human,” I said. “The idea’s occurred to me, but that’s the same as what poisoning that party’s food supply is. I admit, you’re probably right about most people being there to stab everyone in the backs and close ranks with the Shil’vati and be the boot that’s going to step on Earth and make us jump to the Empire’s command. But think of what the ones there would do if we killed one- they’d *never* switch to our side. They’re there not because they’re afraid, they’re there because they are opportunists. You don’t make people like that afraid and win them over.” I sighed and thought of how, again, most of my classmates would probably sell me out for no reason at all..”Love them or hate them, they’re the humans we’re fighting for. Bunch of ingrates and backstabbers, but that’s who the kind of person is who would go there.” 

“That cop, I know you’d shoot him if it came down to being discovered or getting away clean. You would do it, to protect yourself.” George said it this time, finally speaking up. He’d more or less officiated the fight- making sure we just blew off steam. Were we supposed to get a beer after this or something?

“Yeah, probably,” I admitted. “And you’re right, he wouldn’t be any more guilty of betraying humanity than those people. I wouldn’t feel good about it. I’d only do it if I was forced and there was no other option. We have plenty of other options to hurt the Shil’vati that don’t put us in that kind of position, where we become monsters. We’re humans. We do have to have principles. If the Shil’vati came here in peace, would we still be bombing them? No. Why? The war *is* over. The governments surrendered. Japan doesn’t hate America, my father, grandfather, and I all don’t hate Germany. War’s done, that’s the end of the conflict. Remember [‘Bury the Hatchet Day](https://milfordlive.com/2020/11/02/legislators-plan-bury-the-hatchet-event/)’?” Granted that was more about politics.

Vaughn scratched at his chin. “I don’t get it, though. I don’t think anyone here gets it either. *Why* not snap up some lower-class working-class family looking to move up in the world, some girl wanting to see the stars and pop out your progeny like a proper Shil’vati nobleman might? Do what all those old classmates surely are- aim to worm your way in and sucker up to our conquerors?” 

“If you don’t trust me,” Feeling a little lost, I was quiet when I spoke. “How will any of them ever follow me?”

George laughed. “Reality check to *Little Emperor*\- We’re kids, man. They listen because you’ve gotten a lot right and made bombs that actually work and blow up when they’re supposed to. Masks are a good idea for anonymity. Turning off phones and not sending texts about bombs is smart, too. Not listening to all that is probably what got Scott pinched by the Purps. After that, everyone’s scared. You were all Chicken Little when you first came in but people started realising you had some points, and people are noticing. The bombs are good, too, but it’s a valid question. It’s not *normal* for a kid to be coming up with all this."" Translation: *You're a kid, stop trying to be in charge.*

""Yeah. Scott was always keeping his phone on him, didn't seem to care."" I didn't say it but I almost think Scott wanted them to raid so he could try and take them out.

""You two also bagged several Eggplants. Most anyone in there’s managed with all their new bombs are delaying some empty construction sites at night and maybe a lucky hit to get one. That doesn’t mean you run things, just that when you talk, people listen.” George was always the kind to stand by and watch, and only speak up when he really had something to say. So that was most of the people accounted for, even if the body count was really Vaughn.

Speaking of, Vaughn looked up at me from where I’d set him on his ass and took my hand to stand back up. “*Emperor* here could have it all- and instead he’s rolling here with us. I’ve never asked before, but ‘why?’ Is this how you get your kicks? What are you going to do with your life, rich boy? Did you ever even ask yourself that?”

I knew what he was trying to do. “Fuck you,” I said it without malice. I’d learned to be less verbose, though. George froze up for a second and then laughed- because boys in revolutionary armies don’t titter like little girls. “No, really,” I repeated, this time to George. “Fuck you too. I don’t plan for a future because I don’t expect to live for long doing this. They catch me, I don’t expect to live longer than they let me, and neither should either of you. I’m paranoid because losses are inevitable, and the more paranoid you are the better you’ll do. What we’re doing is going to get a lot of us killed. But we’re doing it anyway.” That night of stargazing screamed back into my head but I managed to hold on to the train of thought. *WHY?* My vision swam and I shook it off. “I do it because I hate seeing our conquerors wander around comfortably here like they own the place. I hate them lounging around and living high on our planet. I think that bar fight was exactly what those marines needed. I think it’s what a lot more Marines ought to get. Look, if they’re out of their armour, we’re not short opportunities to fuck with them. These alien chicks wanna get fucked, I say we stick it to ‘em!” George cracked up in reaction to my little speech, then realised I was serious.

“Oh, speaking of chicken little, have you seen all the missing posters lately?”

“Yeah, there’s one at the bus stop where I get off. I don’t think he went to Talay.” 

We looked among each other. “I’d say we need to stop travelling alone but that’s just as dangerous. G-Man, you’re honestly about as fast a runner as I am. Cross Country will be starting up practices again, and I just got invited to try-outs. It’s less suspicious if we’re on the team together.”

George just shook his head. “Hey if you’re afraid to walk alone though, I’ll see if someone will hold your hand.”

“Whatever. Are we all good?” I looked over to Vaughn, then George. Neither said anything, so I led us back in.

“Hey, welcome back Little Emperor, Vendetta, G-man.” By custom, no further comment was made further about the fight or disagreement. We each just nodded back to the Barman.

The rest of the meeting went pretty well. Some veterans stepped up to try and teach combat to any who were interested at future meetings. I was relieved we weren’t going to go after a fancy-sounding name or have to wear traditional clothing. We weren’t ‘competing,’ after all. We were going to try and learn how to hold our own against larger and stronger opponents. 

The meeting was about to wrap when someone in the back piped up. “Apparently we have *got* to see what’s on the TV tonight. I just realised the time.”

“What’s on?”

“New *Night Show with Parker and Pierce*.” 

He hit ‘play’ and the recorded segment started. “And tonight, ladies and gentlemen, we have a very special guest! All the way from the Shil’vati homeworld, we have The Empress!” My jaw dropped- because what was in front of us was in no way an Empress, but definitely someone wearing purple makeup and a fake moustache that had been meticulously groomed and waxed into the shape of horns, while a band played a very very relaxed and sour-sounding improvised version of the Shil’vati Royal Tune, then letting a saxophone riff as the lady shook her hips like a belly dancer.

“Whoo mama!” Exclaimed Parker, staring at the camera with a wide-eyed, “can you believe *this?*” Then his grin grew wide. “I thought you’d be *taller*!”

“Silence, Earth Man! I am here to take your men and shame your women! Look at that one! She is so small, how is she meant to push a plow? Do you simply chain up sentients to do your farm work for you? If so, I approve. Very Shil’vati of you!” She pointed at Pierce, who spun in her chair to mock horror at the camera before completing the spin to ask her question.

“Uh, your Empress, majesty, I mean… I was hoping we could talk a little bit about some domestic issues? You know, maybe what’s been going on down in Maryland?”

“Yes, what of Mary’s Land? It is our land, now! Mary hardly put up any fight!” The ‘live’ audience booed.

“That’s not what I hear,” the host said affably, puffing the collar of his suit by its sides. “But please, have a seat. Are you *sure* there’s nothing going on in Maryland?”

“Of course not, if there was I’d have heard about it!” She exclaimed as she took a seat- only for a man wearing tiger stripe camouflage to sneak up behind her and cuff her shoes together and wink at the camera before commando-crawling back behind the desk. Then he crawled from around that. 

“What! Him! Get him! I want to *marry* him! I mean kill him needlessly!” bellowed the ‘Empress,’ standing from her chair with a roar. He pulled out a detonator and slapped the button. A smoke bomb went off on the chair and the Empress fell forward gracelessly, as if a bomb went off and looked startled, fake moustache hanging at an angle, eyes crossed in a feint of unconsciousness. 

Everyone bowed to the thunderous applause and the show host said “well, we’re ending the show on a bang tonight, hope we see you all tomorrow night!”

**(BONUS CONTENT) Final Night**

In their upscale apartment in Manhattan, Parker and Pierce, the showman (and woman), man and wife, waited for the other shoe to drop along with their head writer.

“Alright everyone. The video just went live. The purps will be here in, oh, about ten minutes.” Pierce said into her phone. She was live-streaming and trying to keep a brave face. Already her presence and stream was blowing up. 

The three people in the room looked at each other with a grim determination.

“For freedom” Alex, their head writer began pouring three glasses of wine.

“For liberty” Parker said, taking hold of his glass.

“For justice” Pierce finished for them, holding her glass out. As soon as all the glasses clinked, she realised her image had frozen in place on the phone. She tried to get the stream back by refreshing it, but it stayed frozen. She finally got it to quit and re-launched the app, only to find that she was locked out from her account.

The minutes ticked down, and then… nothing. 

“Well, maybe they’re running a bit late today.”

After a half hour, they disabled their failsafe. The streets below were quiet.

“Sshh, do you hear that?” Janice asked. “That clinking sound…” Everyone jumped as the cat door flap was pushed open and a little black cat stared up at them in confusion as to why it was being greeted by a few very tense humans, then continued to its food bowl. 

“Well, this is anticlimactic.”

“Yeah, and we’re out of wine. Tell you what. If I see marines breaching the building, I’ll make sure to call Jerry the cameraman. Make it look good! I’ll leave you two for a little, okay?”

“You wouldn’t be running out on us, would you, Alex?”

“I’ll be back in a half hour with another bottle, so keep it a quickie.” He ribbed back to the husband and wife. 

Twenty minutes later, as they were getting dressed again, Pierce realised she still couldn’t get back on her social media stream with her phone. She sent a text over to Alex, only it sent indicating that something was a little wonky with their phone account. Oh well, the SMS is still sent. A minute later they got the knock. “Hey, it’s Alex!”

A quick glance through the peephole confirmed it. He looked a little flustered. “They actually declined my card,” he said. “That was a bit weird, but hey, cash is king! Who wants a little white wine to celebrate living?”

The sun rose on the next day, and they all made their way to the studio- except the studio had a giant lock over it. “Sorry, it’s the building owner- he just terminated our rental agreement.”

“What? But we are generating profit! We can pay the rest,” Alex protested. “Hell, doesn’t he owe *us* for not living up to the terms of the contract? I read and wrote that damn thing myself!”

“That ain’t all, folks,” Parker toned flatly. “None of us can get into our social media accounts. We’re completely locked out- can’t even get the pages to load. Someone told me that they still exist- but no one can get in, comment, post, or interact- not even that wunderkind social media manager you hired for the summer internship. It’s just kind of ‘there.’ They’re on the line with support for the social media pages, but they just keep saying they’re ‘working on it,’ and that it’s a glitch.”

“Well that’s...” none of them wanted to say that the timing was too non-coincidental.  

“It gets worse.”

“The next person who says that is getting slapped,” Pierce cautioned.

“Alright, well, it doesn’t get any better, because do you see this sticker here? They just did a building inspection and gave it a low mark. Even if we get in, we can’t have a live audience in here,” the camera operator said, pointing at the freshly stuck sign behind the lock. “So, no chance we’re gonna move all our stuff, in time to shoot tonight’s show. Even if we had double the staff.”

“If we don’t post an episode, what’s the network going to do?”

“I don’t know. Call them, maybe they’ve got lawyers who can sort this out for us.”

Everyone was now on the verge of panic. The secretary put Pierce on hold for a few minutes, before at last the CEO himself took the call. “Ah, Pierce and Parker. I expect we’ll be seeing more high ratings?”

“Actually sir, we’re having a bit of an issue getting into our studio? The equipment’s been locked away, the building’s been put under lock and key- and-” Parker stared up at the suddenly dimmed room as he felt the enormity of the hole he was in at the moment. Maybe a CEO could handwave it all away. “I think they literally just cut off our power,” someone cursed. “We can’t even get into our social media accounts to get help or see if anyone in Manhattan has a diesel generator or something. I’m sure Alex can find some way to make something funny out of all this, once it’s over.”

“If there’s a will, there’s a way!” The CEO agreed. “But there’s an emergency board meeting in about ten minutes. Something to do with advertisers. I’ll keep you fully appraised. We’re out here in Hollywood so it’s still just about sunrise. I appreciate you reaching out. We’ll send a troubleshooter team down right away if we have to. Maybe you can borrow another studio, call it a publicity stunt. But before you go ahead with that I’ll need the board to sign off.” 

“Godspeed, Mister Goodreich.”

They tried reconnecting the power, tried calling friends, but the only dynamo they had was enough to run a few plugs. Still enough. That same tradesman cut the lock off only for everyone to find that behind those doors, the equipment and entire set had been taken away. Pierce and Parker strode around as if lost, turning occasionally as if expecting the desk or lighting to just reappear. It didn’t. “It’s not fair,” Parker said, as if gobsmacked by what had just happened.  “We’re America’s number one most watched late night TV show. What the hell is this?” While Pierce kept repeating “this is a nightmare. This is a nightmare. I’m going to wake up, and it will all be over, and-“

Her phone rang. She answered it in record time. “Pierce here. Advertisers? What?” Colour drained from her face and she started shaking. “O-of course sir, but please, please you- can you fight for us? We’re the number one!” She started to weep now. “Number…one rated…” and sank to the floor. Parker didn’t even need to ask. He met the eyes of the staff, as he held his wife. The show was over. Advertisers had gotten complaints from seemingly nowhere and everywhere at once as a horde descended on them and demanded they no longer support the network over the content.

A few seconds later, Alex’s phone rang. 

“Ah, Alex,” the saccharine tones of the HR Department’s head spoke. “We’ve lately been having some complaints about Xeno-phobia from the writing team? Would you mind coming in for a mandatory briefing? We do have a company policy on the subject, of course…”",/r/HFY/comments/lnab5k/aliennation_chapter_12_doubt/,22

Chapter 11- The Three S Solution

Willowby Family Farm, Cherokee County, Kansas, many years ago.

Travis was walking through the woods bow in hand. Grandpa and him were working on a deer drive. Pushing any animal forward through the brush in a hope it would run into his mother who had the rifle. His bow was a compound model. The side mounted quiver was mostly filled with flu flu arrows and blunt Judo points for taking something small, like a rabbit or squirrel or, ugh! a possum, if need be. He only had one arrow that had a broadhead. The bow had belonged to his uncle, who must have forgotten he owned it. Because if he had remembered, he would have pawned it or traded it for Oxy.

Mr. Turner, who owned the farm near his grandpa's, had shown him how to tune it and how to shoot it better. He practiced about two or three hours a day. There was really not much else to do right now.

His mom and him had fled the city and moved back in with her parents when the invasion began. The aliens had struck first on the coast pushing any ground troops inward toward the Rockies and the Appalachians. So far, except for seeing their craft in the sky sometimes, they had yet to take any interest in the Midwest. The joke going around most of the farmers was that even alien invaders didn’t give a crap about the flyover states. So we were being invaded by intergalactic Democrats. Though that wasn’t exactly true. People from as far away as Nebraska claimed they saw the streak in the sky that took out NORAD. Travis wasn’t sure if he had. He did remember seeing the ones that took out McConnell and Whiteman.

The reason they were out here deer hunting out of season was that Grandpa had given his small herd of cattle to the national guard months ago for them to slaughter and eat. This wasn’t so much an act of patriotism as it was hard nosed practicality he had explained, Give them the cattle, and they’ll leave our pantry alone. Grandpa had had an older brother who had fought in Europe during WW2 and said his brother had told him horror stories of what he saw when armies had to “forage”.

As he walked the woods pushing the possible deer forward, Travis came to a small dirt road. He was in the middle of the section  when he began checking the sides of the road for a possible rabbit or even a doe or two that might have taken the ditch as a place to lay down during the midday heat. That’s when the van showed up.

Three men got out, all wearing military fatigues. Travis was sixteen, almost seventeen but was already over six feet tall, easily mistaken for an adult. “Hey,” one of them said, ”What ya doing out here buddy?” Travis had heard rumors that the army was desperate that they were drafting everybody they could. He hadn’t even signed up for selective service yet, not being old enough. But he had also heard that there were even more desperate acts, like the *drive by draft board.*

Travis ran.

They chased him back into the woods. The first one to reach Travis tried to grab him by the arm. He was a brown belt in Aikido, applying a *Nikkyo* lock on the man, he waited till he dropped to his knees before kicking him in the ribs. He turned to run again when he suddenly couldn’t move. 

Everything in him had locked up as one of the men had shot him in the back with a taser. Travis fell to the ground unable to move. The bow flung down next to his side. “Motherfucker! “ The man he had kicked had gotten up holding his ribs. ”Fuck this guy, just shoot’em and lets move on.”

“We need to bring everybody we can find to HQ.” The other man said. Travis tried to get up but he received another shock from the taser pinning himself to the ground again. The third man had finally showed up. 

“What the actual fuck you two!” He shouted. “You dipshits cant even take care of one guy?!” 

“Hey, fuck you corporal *sir!”* the guy with the taser sarcastically mocked. “If your lazy ass could run we wouldn’t need to take him down like this. 

“Fuck it, just grab the guy and let’s go.”

“Not yet,” the one who Travis kicked reached into his pocket and slipped on a pair of brass knuckles. “We gotta bring him in, but we don’t need to bring him in with teeth.”

BAM!

He spun around as the bullet tore into his shoulder. 

BAM! BAM!

He took two more in the chest.

BAM! BAM! BAM!

The man with the taser went down next.

Travis was still frozen on the ground, was it from the Taser’s shock, or just plain terror of the moment freezing him there?

Alice was about 20 yards away. She had heard the commotion and had found them. The deer rifle, an old Chinese SKS, still had 4 shots left.

The last man looked at her. “Cat?” he said in surprise.

Travis didn’t know this at the time but Cat was his mom’s nickname in the army. Alice became Allie, Allie became Alley Cat, then finally Cat.

The man began talking, telling her about his family. About how they had escaped California, His wife had died in a strafing run the aliens made. His children were at their encampment. He was trying to talk Alice down. Telling her to remember the old times back in the desert. He didn’t know it was her son they were trying to take. He was sorry.

Alice listened to him, then she shot him in the head.

Hot wet blood splashed oh Travis’ face. That’s what finally made him snap out of his paralysis. Alice came over to him hugging him. “I’m so sorry baby, I’m so sorry!” She kept saying over and over till Grandpa finally found them.

They burned out the van, made it look like it was hit by something, or that the men had abandoned it.

As for them? The three S solution: Shoot, Shovel, and Shut up.

The next week was Travis’ seventeenth birthday. There was no cake, but Grandma had made his favorite dish of hers: chicken and homemade noodles. Though they used squirrels instead of chicken. Three days later, the US government and what was left of the military had agreed to unconditional surrender.

Two months after that Travis and Alice returned to Kansas City. He still had high school to finish. And Alice still had her job, at least she hoped she still did. Passing through the checkpoint Travis couldn’t stop staring at the Marine at the checkpoint checking their new IDs they had been issued.

It was the first time he had ever seen a Shil’vati.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

“What happened to your Grandparents, after that?” Mel’Bae asked him.

“They continued working the farm till grandpa had a heart attack while fixing the combine. He was dead before he hit the ground. Grandma followed him 3 months later, she...chose.” He had trouble getting the words out.

“I was away in Japan at the time and couldn’t get back for either funeral. We didn’t have the money to travel back.”

“None of this is your fault Travis.” Alice told him. “We sent you to Japan because Dave recommended that it would help you.”

“And it did! I was fine until…”

“Until you weren’t anymore,” Sensei told him. “You pushed it all down and now that you were attacked it’s brought it all back up to the surface. Travis you need to go to the hospital and get treatment, more than what we can provide in support.”

“No, I can’t.” he grumbled. “We all know that the medical field has a high amount of people friendly to the resistance. If I tell them what happened in therapy, how do I know they won’t pass that on to some group that will target Mom?”

*Well, I sure as shit didn’t know that about the human medical field.* Mel’Bae thought.

“Bullshit Travis!” His mom struck her hand down on the table making him jump a bit from the noise. “Travis, listen. You are not responsible for me. I’m your mother. I'm responsible for you. I know it was horrible what I put you through when I was sick. I know you’ve always had a need to protect me and  everyone around you. But now I have to protect you. If the price of that is someone finding out I killed 3 soldiers who could have become Resistance while protecting you. Then that’s what has to be done. 

“Wait a moment,” Mel’Bae looked at the three of them. “What you're talking about sounds like *Krabit Chigau*...Umm Battle sickness. Travis didn’t they test you for that when you were in the hospital?”

“No. They don’t do psych evals for broken ribs.” Sensei said. “In fact nobody understood PTSD or what did you call it? *Krabit Chigau*? When I was just back from Nam, they almost gave me a dishonorable discharge because I kept fighting with the junior officers. Our Colonel took pity on me seeing all my promotions were earned in combat and shredded my two-oh-one file. Then he wrote a new one.”

“Turox Piss!” Mel’Bae shouted. “They fucking check us for it more regularly than they do for crotch rot!” Surprise was seen all around the table. “Travis, Darling, if you love me please listen to everybody here who loves you. Come with us to the hospital.”

They all looked with worry at Travis. He finally spoke, “Are you sure you’ll be OK, mom?”

“Yes, I will Travis. You don’t need to worry.”

“OK,” he held Mel’Bae’s hand. “Off to the nuthouse I go”

“Travis!” they all groaned.

“Yeah, I know, my sense of humor sucks, Maybe they’ll cure that too.”

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 

Travis checked into the hospital voluntarily, They all went with him. It was a minimal security area, mostly people receiving treatment for things like depression or substance abuse. The doctors let his “Family” view the facility with him. They wanted him to stay for a week, then outpatient care would be discussed. Treatment was free of charge. Another thing the evil alien invaders had forced down their Freedom Lovin' American subjects’ throats.

They said their goodbyes. It was hardest for Mel’Bae to leave him here. His mother, and Sensei, who she had just learned was named Dave, went outside to get into the van.

“I’m glad to finally meet you in person, Mel’Bae.” Alice said.

“Me too, It’s just that I wish it was for better circumstances. I mean why did nobody think to check him for this? I thought he was losing his mind! What the fuck were human doctors even doing before we showed up? Shaking rattles and banging drums to chase the evil spirits away!”

“We were a little more advanced than that.” Sensei chimed in.

“I know I’m just so…. worried.”

“We all are.” Alice said.

They made plans to meet up in three days to visit Travis at the hospital They then dropped Mel’Bae off at the base. Alice and Sensei took a drive back to the motel she had checked into.

“That big purple girl really loves him.” Alice looked at Travis’ Sensei, her old friend Dave, who she had met at a veterans support group after her own stay in the hospital. Long before the Shil’vati showed up with better options.

“Yeah, I’ve gotten to know a lot of them teaching on base. She’s one of the good ones.” 

“Funny, I always thought he’d end up with some little Japanese girl, at least that’s what his search history always had on it when he was a teen.”

“Alice!”

“Hey, a mother needs to know these things. What worries me is how she described treatment for PTSD, how they screen for it so often.”

“How can you think that’s a bad thing?”

“Because Dave, I’m worried about what kind of atrocious things someone could do if they know a guilty conscience can be so easily erased.”

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Alan and the old man drove in his car down the expressway back towards home. The last few days had been hectic. After getting rid of the body, the old man insisted on going to each of Frank’s people; both the ones he was extorting for sleeping with Shil’vati and the ones who were willing to do so for a price. “No matter what happens. You have got to make sure you keep them on the hook.” The old man told Alan. “If they miss one payment then they think they can miss another. Then they think they can just cut you out completely, At which point you either have got to beat them till they realize their place. Or if need be….” He left it up in the air. Alan involuntarily thought about that implication, as it was, he wasn’t going to forget the redhead's limp figure sinking in the concrete. He wasn’t in a hurry to find other suckers who needed to be dealt with. 

“By the way how’s that Sugar Mama of yours?” The old man’s little private joke about the high ranking Shil’vati he hooked Alan up with. It wasn’t exactly whoring, more a trading of favors. and Alan kept them in her good graces. Besides the parties she threw for other high muckety mucks were wild, and also profitable.

“She wants to meet you.” Alan began. “There’s something she wants to work out between….”

“You gave her my name!” He almost snarled. 

“No, when she said she might have to find someone new to get entertainment for her guests I told her someone who’s higher up in Frank’s organization contacted me and wants to talk to her about keeping the arrangements the same. She doesn’t know who you are unless you want me to arrange the meet.”

“Alan, I knew you had a brain in there,” He took one hand off the steering wheel and patted him on the back before bulling off the highway and onto the surface streets. “Now, we just got to get you to grow some hair on your balls.”

*You’re the fucking reason I use that Purp-made depilatory rinse crap!* Alan grumbled to himself. Instead, all he said was. “Well, it’s what the lady likes.”

“Yeah,” the old man said as he drove down a residential street. “I know son, I know.” He sounded almost grim about the whole thing.

They pulled into a medium-sized house with a detached garage. Alan got out and pulled open the garage door from the handle near the ground. The old man claimed he was afraid someone could clone a signal from an automatic garage door opener and break in, Alan just thought he was too cheap to get one.

The old man pulled the car in, shut off the engine and popped the trunk. Alan rolled down the garage door and opened the trunk. Inside was a small bowling ball bag full of stuff, mostly jewelry or other things that can be bartered. He opened it up, taking the things out and stuffing it into the usual hiding place. 

Afterward they checked each other for signs of blood on their clothes. One of the guys had gotten pissy about still having to pay even though he was getting divorced and keeping his little secret was beginning to get out of the hand. Just paying off his soon-to-be ex-wife’s lawyer would have been more than worth it in the long run, compared to the dentist he needs now after our visit.

Everything was clean so they walked up to the house. Opening the side door next to the kitchen, they saw a fifteen year old girl deep in thought as she appeared to be mixing up a salad to set on the table. She looked up from her labor and broke into a smile.  “Daddy, Alan, you’re just in time.”

Mass Effect: Logical Conclusions, A Routine Checkup

Science is humanity’s greatest weapon. Curiosity our greatest strength. There is nothing we cannot understand and if we do run across something too vast for an individual, we can work together to unravel its mysteries. The human condition is ever improving, at least for those in power, each new advancement unlocking more of our potential and one day very soon, we will have the keys to ever further improve ourselves.

**New York, New York, North America, Earth**

Hannah watched the MRI move over her, doing her best to relax despite the fact that she could feel the magnets moving over her with her eezo coated nerves. When the machine finally retracted, Hannah immediately sat upright and stretched happily. She could hear the footsteps of her doctor along with her daughter approaching the room and turned to face the door before it opened.

“Well it looks like you’re healthy as can be. I’d say the gene therapy is a total success. Anderson will be quite happy to hear this.” Doctor Chakwas smiled at her fellow veteran, watching Hannah get to her feet alongside Jeanne Shepard. “In fact, you look young enough to be your daughter’s older sister instead of her mother.” Chakwas smiled as the two redheads in the room both rolled their eyes.

“Don’t even joke like that.” Jeanne, now fifteen chuckled, shaking her head. “It’s bad enough everyone knows my family’s name. The last thing I need to hear is someone talking about my mom like that.”

“You complain about fame and yet you’ve achieved podium finishes for the Spartakiads in kickboxing twice now and you’re only fifteen.” Chakwas pointed out, having watched the now fifteen year old young woman earn a silver in her first appearance at thirteen and a gold in her second last year. Nobody doubted she’d make an appearance in this year's events either.

“Well I got annoyed about the memes making fun of people born in orbit. Decided to show the ground pounders how we throw down in space.” Jeanne shot back, though her words were met with soft frowns.

“I’d warn you against dividing yourselves along such stupid lines. I know it’s what humans do but we really should’ve learned our lesson.” Chakwas cautioned, the look in her seemingly young eyes growing momentarily distant and cold.

“Oh, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean-”

“It’s quite alright but do try and break the habit. Like it or not, you’re stuck in the spotlight and your words have more influence than you realize.” Chakwas cautioned, letting out a sigh. “Hannah, you can go change back into your normal clothes.”

“Thank goodness, hospital gowns just aren’t a fashion I’d like to be sporting if I can help it.” Hannah joked, leaving the room to get dressed.

“What were things like?” Jeanne’s voice was low, partially to keep her mother’s sharp ears from picking up her words.

“You mean the war?” Chakwas closed her eyes and pinched the bridge of her nose, seeing tents full of wounded screaming soldiers. The moans of the dying mixed with the roar of artillery and the staccato beat of gunfire. “It was awful. People say war is hell but they’ve got no idea what they’re talking about. War is far, far worse.”

Jeanne swallowed, looking into Chakwas piercing green eyes. The doctor who despite looking not a day over twenty was well into her early forties shook her head and began to leave the room.

“It’d still do it all again though. For the world we’ve created, it was worth it. Even though it was terrifying and I had to… break my oath, it was worth it.” Chakwas motioned for Jeanne to follow her and the two women walked through the hallways of the UNE’s premier hospital. “Even before we united things were going well. Compared to most of human history at least but once the borders fell away and projects began to merge, the world raced into the future. The Prothean data helped, of course, but honestly most of what they had we’d have discovered within ten, maybe twenty years with the help of our newest companions.” Chakwas winked at the hologram of a teenage young boy wearing a greek himation along with sandals and a rod with snake wrapped around it that had just snapped into existence.

“You should listen to Chakwas, she’s the best.” Asclepius, the hospital’s AI stated, smiling happily at his human friends.

“You know I always do. I’ve been coming here every year since the Enterprise was turned into a museum ship for my eezo checkups.” Jeanne shot back, her unique condition prompting yearly medical exams alongside her parents. “By the way, any chance I can go shooting with your old war buddies again?”

“Unfortunately, both of them are undergoing their N7 exam this year.” Chakwas smiled as the young woman’s eyes went wide with admiration. The program had been in the works since before she’d been born but it was finally going into full swing. Human augmentation was the science that had benefited the most from the reverse engineering the Prothean archives. It turns out the species were a master of genetic engineering, capable of re-purposing a race from the ground up to achieve their goals. The news had sent off alarm bells until the scientific community had managed to confirm that no such actions had been performed upon humanity. “In fact you just missed them, they were both resting off their final augmentations here a week ago.”

“Damn, well we were looking at our new home at the time so I can’t complain.” Jeanne smiled at Chakwas who raised an eyebrow.

“Let me guess, your family has once again decided to go and explore somewhere nobody’s been before?” Chakwas looked over at the young woman who grinned happily.

“We’re going to Pluto and I’m going to be on the crew. I’m going to miss the yearly Spartakiads but I’ll be able to complete my degrees while I’m away so once I get back, I’m going to get my own N7 badge. Should be a cakewalk since I’m already psychic.” Jeanne replied confidently, eager to follow in her family’s proud traditions of exploration and service to humanity.

“Glad to hear it. The world needs people like you and even if you only stay in the service for a decade or two, I’m sure you’ll do well. In fact, you might do so well, you’ll get assigned to the first interplanetary mission. It’s no secret that the brass likes to play up heroes and in peacetime that means explorers and scientists.” Chakwas smiled mischievously as the child, clearly knowing more than she was letting on.

“When and how?” Jeanne answered, eager to finally step out from under the shadow of her parents.

“Asclepius, when does the Pluto mission end?” Chakwas looked over at her AI coworker who popped into existence once more now that they were inside her office.

“It’s going to take five years, if she wants to make N7 in time for the big mission, she’s going to need at least a masters degree in that time. It’s not impossible but it’s going to be rough.” The AI replied, smiling happily at his fellow teenager. “Though, the Pluto program does use the individualized educational program and I’m fairly certain my brother will be on the mission. If you’re willing to work hard, I’m sure he’ll lend you a hand.”

“Thank you thank you thank you!” Jeanne clapped her hands together and bowed dramatically for the AI in a show of gratefulness.

“Don’t thank me yet, Pluto ain’t known for being patient. Try to pull the spear out of his ass will you?” Asclepius barked out a laugh before glancing at the door. “Mama Shepard is back.” He announced a second before the red haired woman entered the room in her street clothes.

“I miss anything?” Hannah’s smile said she knew something, but Jeanne wasn’t sure how much of the conversation she’d heard.

“Jeanne was just talking about her ambitions. Speaking of, the Pluto mission? Was the Enterprise not enough for you?” Chakwas chortled and Hannah scratched her head slightly embarrassed.

“I got bit by the bug and so did Sigmund. Even Jeanne’s not innocent, we all wanted to go and when the offer came up…” Hannah trailed off with a shrug. “Plus now that I don’t have to worry about aging, I don’t have to slow down my adventurism.”

“Normally people would start thinking about their future when given centuries to live.” Chakwas observed and Hannah shrugged.

“I need to do as much as I can. The Reapers are coming and when they arrive we need to be ready. The more I can contribute the better and when they get here, I’ll join the fight.” Hannah’s eyes glowed with blue light momentarily.

“Leave something for us youngins to do, will ya?” Jeanne joked, poking her mom playfully.

“I’m sure you’ll surpass me soon enough. You’re way more proficient with your psychic abilities than I am.” Hannah countered, remembering their most recent sparing match. Hannah had been teaching her daughter self defense since she could walk. The two had laid the groundwork for psychic martial arts and Anderson would occasionally have both of them demonstrate their skills to members of the N program. An event that Jeanne and Hannah both looked forward to since it always ended with a young teenager humiliating a group of freshly minted psychic soldiers.

“I guess, still I’m glad I don’t have to worry about taking care of you when you’re older.” Jeanne snarked, grinning at her mother playfully.

“You’re lucky I love you.” Hannah shot back, pulling her daughter into a one armed hug. “Hey Chakwas, anything I need to worry about?”

“Other than your daughter’s open ambitions to become an N7, nope, nothing at all.” The doctor replied happily, sitting down in her chair and looking over her next appointments. “The Ryders are up next, if you spot them down in the lobby send them up alright?”

“Those twins are on Earth? I thought they were still living on Mars.” Hannah looked over at Chakwas curiously who shrugged.

“I heard they wanted to watch a certain famous teen’s third and as it turns out, final appearance in the Spartakiads.” Chakwas replied knowingly, looking over at Jeanne with a grin.

“Well I’ll send them up. Hope they don’t ask for an autograph though.” Hannah replied, visibly amused that her former coworker’s children had ended up idolizing her daughter.

\*\*\*

After the war ended, a lot changed rapidly. Artificial Intelligence, Genetic engineering, mechanical augmentation and nanotechnology all became massive areas of human effort. The Protheans were true masters of these sciences and while most of their technological know how was used upon and then left to the Asari, they did leave quite a bit of information for humanity. So much information that the dumbed down canonical humans would take “centuries if not millennia of work” to decipher it all. Sidestepping the silliness of that statement, in this timeline science is fully funded and there are many times more researchers available for all fields then in canon. Combine that with AI and a full understanding of the Prothean Language to make decoding the data a breeze and it’s already an open book.

This has some serious consequences for the story. The first is obviously an even further acceleration of human technology. Here is an example, the Protheans had designs for the crucible within the Mar’s archive. I won't talk more about what the crucible is to avoid spoilers but for those who know, that thing was in the Mars archives and the humans of this timeline fully excavated and cracked the archives well over 100 years before canon. What does this mean? It means that humanity is not only starting from an alternative base of technology and continuing down that road, their understanding of “traditional” Mass Effect based technology is at the Prothean level. 100 years before the story stars.

\*\*\*

The eternal war within any writer. Do I sit on a chapter, edit it to death and make it perfect or crank out the next chapter? It rages on in my soul every time I post. I try to keep things above a certain level of quality and I hope that shows through. 

&gt;!I put a lot of thought into Mechs and they're still not logical. This makes me sad. I came up with one idea but it is setting dependent and this is not that setting. Still at least my flock of Geth are keeping me company. They like mechs too.!&lt;",/r/HFY/comments/lovg63/mass_effect_logical_conclusions_a_routine_checkup/,27
7,lp32db,HFY,Sun Feb 21 20:20:34 2021,"War Is Declared On Earth, By God.","July 5th:  A Baby Boy is born.  He does not cry.  He will remember his birth perfectly. 

That Baby Boy is God.   He takes the form of a human.  But he did not know that at the moment. Because he did not know anything.  He was just born.

&amp;#x200B;

8 years later:  The young boy noticed that lights bow out quite frequently when he is angry. He wonders why this is.  He wonders if he might have powers. But he mostly just cares about playing his ""video games"". He likes Zelda, and Star Fox.

&amp;#x200B;

9 years old:  A couple of human boys try to pick a fight with our young hero. The reason?  A girl.   

The biologically 9 year old boy wins the fight. He uses his powers. He does not know why he did that. The other 2 young human boys get layed out.  The teachers do not appear to notice. Young human/God goes back to his day. Goes home, and plays video games. 

&amp;#x200B;

16 years old:  The young boys begins to grow into a young man.  The teenager like video games, and smoking weed. He is getting intelligent. He is fond of war games and strategy.  He enjoys watching History Channel videos about wars on earth. He does not remember he is God. But he notices his radio just broke when he got angry.

&amp;#x200B;

19 years old:  A train breaks down. Our 19 your young hero, a young adult now, who is both a human and God, starts to get suspicious that he really does have powers. He notices he was really angry, when the train shut down.   He wonders.  The train starts back up. Our hero is not worried, he feels like he is a survivor, and he will be okay no matter what. He guess the train would start again, and all would be fine.

&amp;#x200B;

23 years old: Our video game loving hero, God, who thrives on his violent video games, and his fondness for many human passions, remembers the future.  He realizes he really does have powers. He calls on out the internet. No one answers. The man forgets soon after.

&amp;#x200B;

25 years old:  It happens. God, who is on earth, is having a conversation when he realizes he remembered this happening.  The conversation involved being told he was the extremally powerful. The man, who is also God, forgets about all this a couple days later.

&amp;#x200B;

26 years old: Help arrives. He brings weed, and a video games system. God is amazed, he does not understand what is happening. God is told that he is God, by help.  God forgets the next day.

&amp;#x200B;

31 years old:  The young man this story centers around, God, he in his room. He still enjoys his video games, he likes learning, and strategy. He really loves the HFY forums.  He thinks humans are awesome.  

Something happens... Memory's come flooding back.  And the young man now knows he is at the center of something big, really big.  He knows he has powers, he knows he is the most powerful individual on earth.  He does not care too much about having powers, or flying around, because right now he is trying out how to save the world and survive doing it.  He has no idea how to use his powers, but, he is going to try to kill someone evil who does. 

Images begin flashing through the young mans head.  Images of battles, deaths, presidents being hijacked, suicides, assassinations.  He knows now, this has happened before.  This is not his first lifetime.  He feels cold.  The initial fear passes.   He thinks he is likely going to die,  but a meeting, much like Ellimist vs crayak, seems inevitable. Complete with the traditional talk between good and evil before the fight. 

He does not know how to use his powers yet, but, he knows he makes a gigantic explosion when gets killed. This comforts him somewhat.  Its just a shame his foe makes a sizable explosion when he dies too.  

Time goes on, and the young human waits for some sort of government response. He wants a ride to meet his foe, and wants to plan the date.  He wants to get this over with. Live or die. He wonders how to use his powers.

&amp;#x200B;

The young man remembers he is God. He remembers what it is like to control all.  Free Will, Cosmic Power, he remembers what it feels like to have control of everything.  He sees aliens really do exist. 

&amp;#x200B;

Time goes on... Lifetimes of memories come pouring in... first a few, then  hundred, and then spanning million and then billions of lifetimes.  He remembers fights, wives, love, pain, and war with the devil. A war that has spanned all of time and space, since before earth was made, before women were invented, before the gift of eternal life was given. 

God knows now, the span of such a war, and the cost. Quadrillions of lives, untold pain, and many hard decisions. 

Being in the form of a man, God like humans, and has many similarities to humans.

God would love to give the people of earth everything... Millions year life spans... Gold... Silver.. Free housing... Technology... More sex.... More love... Happiness.

There is just one problem... God wants something from humans.  

He wants weed, and 1 thousand dollars.   

The Military refuses.

God declares war on the people of this Earth.

&amp;#x200B;

December 24th:  A message is sent out on Google.  ""Red, Green, White... This is God... Provide Marijuana and 1,000 dollars cash with speed.  Wipe Memories afterward. 2 hours preferred.""

An alert triggers within the government, a command code been received. This messages informs of the government that the sender of this Alpha Code is God. 

&amp;#x200B;

December 25th, the devils birthday:  God sends additional messages.

I am November

I am December

I am January

Born in Roe (July), on the day America first had freedom.

The Great One. (December)

I sent a command to the government via Google for the following:

Follow all directives EXTACTLY, with NO deviation.

DO NOTHING other then the following:

1: Provide 1 pound of marijuana to me ASAP, (MAKE SURE I GET IT.)

2: Provide $1,000 cash at the same time.

3: Erase all memories ASAP afterwards, with speed. - This includes command officers and all ranks, right to the top. Spare no one a memory wipe. I expect it to be done by the end of the day. No later.

DO NOTHING TO MY MEMORIES. For it is High Treason. A capital offense.

My powers will prevent a wipe if i want one spared, and it is likely to be only one, if anyone.

Ill try to fix up all fuck ups on your part. If your memory wipe tech is shit.

Let it be that my powers save the ones who i would accept being spared a memory wipe. Being almost no one, save perhaps a few to my guess. And let my powers intervene to make the memory wipes safer for those who go through it. Let it be that my powers use wise judgment on this.

4: Do not monitor my communications, other then waiting for me to phone December code.

5: Do not get a visual on me unless I am outside my house, on my street of my home address. - only plain view optics and infrared. No UV.

Do not scan me.

Do not touch me in any way.

Do not interfere in my affairs in any way.

Do not spy on me in my home.

DO NOTHING WITH TIME TRAVAL OR TIME =MANIPULATION.

DO NOT TRACK ME IN ANY WAY ABROAD. NOR MONITER ME.

DO NOTHING OTHER THEN THAT. - FULL HOLD.

You may break into my house, but not my bedroom.

Do not attack me in anyway. Do nothing that could be considered an attack.

Subtly is pointless to get to me. But do not shout about me and who i am. You will just have to erase their memories.

Make no offers to me. Give me nothing other then what was commanded. Say little. Keep this situation hush. I will contact your people on December 31 for tasers. You won't remember this. Failure to respond to a request for tasers will result in the December code being used.

You are about 20 hours PAST DUE.

Come, Deliver, And Leave. (No need to bow.)

BEWARE advice to go to the ""lue"", to find out information.

Follow these commands exactly and with no deviation.

Here is some curtesy information.

On death or on choice, I come back for another lifetime as a human on earth.

I like humans. I made your local existence to have friends. But was then informed sex would become my new favorite activity. And thus this is the reason your species still exists.

I am usually human, and view my self as human, (As god in the form of a human, with human instincts.)

Sometimes i remember my past lives as a baby already, sometimes i remember later in life. This time it was later in life.

I spent the last year remembering about a trillion lifetimes worth of memories.

Being born in America and raised here, is helpful to me, as it gives me a good basis for how i choose to ""run things"".

Lastly, execute the one who sent me this message. ""Haha, no you're not. Fuck off.""

Former Commander of The NSA 

Former Commander Of The CIA 

Former General Of The Military

I am the Lord.

Heaven bow's to me. I command it.

I can command Hell.

I can resurrect the dead.

I decide if you go to Heaven or Hell.

I gave you eternal life. On death, you come back for another lifetime.

On December the 24th, I gave specific instructions to your people. These instructions were ignored.

Following These instructions was critical.

You let me, and everyone else down. For all life was at stake. And you failed it badly.

I am considering putting all of you in Hell, for eternity.

I am considering taking back my gift of eternal life. So that you have no more lifetimes.

All is due.

I would have given you lifespans that allowed you to live a Million Years.

Now you won't be getting shit, and this is very likely the End Times for you.

I have lived on this planet, in America, for about 32 years. As a human, my preferred form.

I like living in America, because it helps me be a good leader, and gives me a good basis for how to run everything.

When i die, or when i choose to end my current lifetime, i come back. And i am often reborn. It can help get me back to how i was, and helps with the build up of memories, For i often start off as a blank slate at birth. This allows me to have a normal childhood, assuming i do not get my memories back at a young age. For sometimes i do.

I was born as a blank slate, and grew up like almost any other person America, with the exception of odd phenomena.

I knew I was special all my life. Lights would break when I was angry, radios would go haywire, trains would grind to a halt. Angle signs would be in the sky. And the clouds would spell out my name. Items would appear that i lost in inaccessible places. And I would be told that I was god, only to forget, the next day.

I just spent the last year remembering a span of over a trillion lifetimes of memory's.

I created your species existence long ago. I wanted friends, later I was told that humans would do something called sex, and it would become a favorite activity of mine one day. And thus, this is what shaped your species.

Currently, your species exists for 3 reasons. Sex, Love, and America.

I have fought for your species survival for trillions of lifetimes. For the devil loved nothing more then to ruin you. But I kept you alive, and flourishing. And kept the way you are intact, mostly.

I gave human men emotions. I made women's childbirth less painful.

When the devil made you evil giants, I saved you.

When the devil turned you into giant spiders, I saved you.

When the devil killed all humans, I brought your species back, and I created your sister planet Ninirvana.

Your Earth is one of many hundreds of Earths.

The universe you live in, is one of dozens around you. And is tiny compared to the larger picture.

You most likely live in a pocket existence, one of many pockets, in a non-pocket existence, that has its own soup of universes.

You may very well be in a machine, called ""eternity"".

I once got into an argument that I could create a better eternity, and so I did, and a machine was the result. We are likely in that now. I advise extreme caution should you ever choose to mess with this. For it would be your end.

Outside of this machine is another eternity, and that is connected to another eternity above it. There are other universes in this eternity. And there are other levels after that.

You have angered me, massively. You are in very very deep trouble. For your people have defied God.

You are now useless. your chance to help, largely expired.

Read this carefully. For i am going to give you a list of what I want you to do. If you do not do this, You are all going to die.

If you do ANYTHING WRONG to me, you will die. All of you.

If you SAY anything wrong to me, you will die.

If you play 1 trick. If you play 1 mind game. If you so much as ARGUE with me. You will die.

1: Bring me marijuana - high quality. Street bought or similar. No Government shit, its tends to be too light and airy. NO technology manufactured weed using walnuts or whatever gizmos you have, real grown weed only.

I expect at least some weed in a few hours maximum. MOVE AT SPEED. I expect the rest by tomorrow. A few pounds should do nicely. But get me at least a pound for starters.

2: Give me money, lots of it, 10 million+ should do, probably. I expect it within 24 hours or so. You might want to bring some cash right away. - Make sure the money is fully legit. Complete legit.

3: Give me a house, a nice one, with MASSIVE privacy. I want total privacy. I don't care what you have to do to your own operations, but get me it. And make this happen SOON. And i want the house to be on the correct side of the street. Ill figure that out when it gets to that. Usually its on the left, against the flow of traffic. And i want good internet with it. Because I want all the video gaming services with it.

4: Give me a flexible pussy schedule. I want hot whores provided after i move into my new place.- Once i am in my new house, i want an easy way to have pussy sent to me, at my whim, on an on-demand schedule. What i want and when i want it. No slaves, voluntary only - Don't send the women yet, ill wait until i am in my new crib, until then, ill settle for some weed and cash.

5: Mind wipe EVERYONE, as much as possible, set it up how you have to, but, make it happen. I want as little people to know about me, and what i am up to, as possible. Even 1 person is more then i would prefer. If you need a couple of essentials, I MIGHT tolerate that, but it would be better if they are wiped also. - No need to mind wipe the whores, unless its needed. And it might be needed.

Make sure you have a tight plan. Because i don't want to be dealing with your commanders pretending to be a tough guy and asking why i have been white listed but no information pops up, After they get wiped.

After i am ready to leave your planet, i will request tasers, most or all of you will not remember this, but we will redo this little chat, and then either you will give me tasers, or i will call for back-up if needed. You will not like my back-up.

Do not offer me tasers early. Do not give me tasers early. Do not ask my to help you or display my powers before i get tasers. If i wanted to use my powers to do things, i would do it now, i am under-cover for a reason. And you are not supposed to know it. But shit got serious. So I called dues. And everything is due. That is fact. And isn't arguable.

I hope you got good memory wipe tech. My powers will help, but don't expect too much from me until taser day when it comes to helping your memories.

6: I want every major video game system, and a fuck-ton of video games to go with it. It's not a joke. It's very serious. N64, PS1, PS2, Game Cube, Wii, WiiU, PS3, PS4, PS5, Sega Genesis, Xbox, Xbox 360, Xbox 1. All the major systems. - MAKE SURE YOU GET THEM.

7: Replace all my equipment so its free of spy-shit, bugs, anything that can violate my privacy. I don't care if you have to rob best buy, but do it. Same thing with all my cloths, and everything else. EVERY SINGLE THING I HAVE MUST BE BUG-FREE.

And i plan on ordering shit online, so its time to abandon and undo any spy-rings you got. any practices you have to bug consumer equipment need to be ended right away. Don't toss my computer, just bug rid it, preferably. Don't toss my cell phone either, just bug rid it, preferably, and you might want to give me some sort of ultra-privacy cell phone also.

After this is all done, and as many minds have been wiped as possible, you will await my request for tasers, then we do this all over again. If you do not give me tasers, i will get back-up, and then your fate will be decided.

NO TIME TRAVIL. NO TIME MANIPULATION- STOP ALL TIME MANIPULATION.

IF YOU TRY TO CHANGE THE PAST, I WILL TORTURE YOU. IF YOU ATTACK ME, YOU DIE. IF YOU TRY TO PLAY A MIND GAME WITH ME, YOU DIE. AND GO TO HELL FOREVER.

THE FOLLOWING IS CONSIDERED HIGH TREASON / A HIGH CRIME AGAISNT GOD.

1: Do NOT fuck with my mind.

2: Do NOT fuck with my memories.

3: Do NOT fuck with my love

4: Do NOT fuck with my lust.

5: Do NOT prevent me getting pussy.

6: Do NOTHING that risks war between me and myself at another point in time. Nor try to get around me, by going to me at a different point in time.

7: DO NOT mess with my relationships.

8: If your a female I am fucking or who is sucking me off, never stop halfway out of malice. Once you start, make sure you finish, stopping out of malice is a high crime.

9: DO NOT FUCK WITH MY PAST. Unless I consent. YOU WILL BE TORTURED. Do not try to get around this rule.

10: Do not try to steal my powers or take powers from me. Even an attempt, is a high crime.

And if i find out that you have been deleting history, you are fucked. This includes deleting people in the present. You don't know what that shit will do.

I will be doing a full inspection for wrongdoing before leaving this planet. Know this. For I will examine you and how you have used what little power you scraped up.

Now it is time to shit talk you. Because i know what it is like to be a gung-ho solder for the military. I know how wired many of you are. And i know how tough you think you are.

You are NOT tough. You are a pip-squeak.

you are NOT strong. I will fuck you up and whoop that ass.

Your technology scares NO ONE. It is a joke, and it might scare the little Septembers, but not me.

Your entire planet's combined army's, makes me snicker, and me and those with any real power laugh at them.

An October can chump your entire solar system in 5 minutes. One of my wives can pea-soup your entire galaxy.

One my sons can fuck your whole universe up. My daughters will kick your women's ass's. The earth will happily toss your ass into the sun if I ask it to.

I can bring back your dead grandmother and have her beat your ass with a shoe.

I can turn you into a tea-cup, break you, toss you into a black hole, and shit you out of a white hole into a quasar.

I control Free-Will itself. Time, space, matter, energy, light, shadow, everything and everyone.

My current goal is to wind down, relax, and prepare for taking rulership over all life. For i just spent a year dealing with the burden of remembering over a span of a trillion life-times, and i want to relax, and smoke weed, and fuck puddy, and chill out, before taking over all life. This is part of the plan.

I would have been gone by dec 31, but i had the forces of evil fuck up my plan, so that is where you came in, too bad you did not respond, i would have been gone by tomorrow. You would have lived nearly-forever if that is what you wanted. Now, the best you can hope for, is that i forget about you for awhile, after you give me what i want.

If you do not respond quickly with the weed, i will end this, and get off world.

All people i want to save have already been evacuated or will be evacuated soon.

DON'T FUCK UP

You already did. But don't fuck up again.

IT'S YOUR SOUL.

IT IS YOUR LIFE.

THE STUPID SHOULD FEAR ME. Read sinners in the hands of an angry god. It's kinda like that.

No need to bow, I am not really into that, unless your a women about to suck my dick.

You can call me God, or my human name, which I am confident you figured out already.

You can enter my home without asking to bring me that weed tonight, but, you might want to reconsider busting into my bedroom without asking. Feel free to kick out my roommates, I don't really like them very much anyway. One of them got in my way when i was trying to save the universe, and the other tried to tell me what to do, so i don't really care what happens to them.

***

Keith was drinking with a group of strangers. Nonetheless, he still felt a sense of brotherhood with his fellow airmen as he downed the mead in his flagon. Once the group of them all finished their tankards (as was the tradition for every toast within Valhalla) the questions began honing in on Keith.

The man across from Keith, a roughed up British guy with messy black hair, spoke first. “Tell me bruv, what’s your name and how’d you end up in Valhalla?”

Keith scratched the back of his neck. “Captain Keith Goodman. I was shot down in my F-117 during the Kosovo War.”

“You’re a captain and you died in 1999,” another man chimed in. “Looks like you’re not replacing Harry as FNG.”

“Hey! Just because I arrived earlier but died before him doesn’t mean I should still be FNG,” exclaimed a man who Keith surmised was Harry.

“Blimey mate, you’re freshie because you done and strafed the enemy like a bloody fool in an F-15.”

“Fuck off! How was I supposed to know they had anti air guns in some remote valley in Iraq?”

Another voice jibed, “Common sense, dumbass. You’re not an attack pilot.”

All around him, the table broke into insult after insult aimed at the poor guy. All Keith could do is sip the dregs from his flagon and twist his head with dismay. It seemed that everyone else had been drinking for much longer than he had.

All this rancor was soon thrown aside, as the halls intercom had come online. “It looks like we have another new arrival to Valhalla! A hearty welcome to Captain Keith Goodman, US Air Force. His weapon is the legendary F-117 “Nighthawk,” which he has flown 41 sorties with and scored 714 kills until he was shot down in 1999! As usual, we will commence the traditional skjaldborg battle!”

The hall erupted with the roar of cheering men as they celebrated his arrival, some of the ones from the adjacent tables getting up to get a better look at him. Keith grinned, as he had scored seven hundred and fourteen kills. He wondered how many people he had condemned to Valhalla with those paveways. Someone around here probably had some beef to pick with him.

The man to Keith’s side turned to face him. “The Nighthawk is a very impressive plane,” he began in a heavy russian accent. “How does it fly? I’d wager that its angular shape makes it very difficult to handle.”

“The plane handles itself. The fly-by-wire does most of the work. What about you? What planes have you flown?”

“I flew a P-63 during the Great Patriotic War, though I sadly was shot down in a MiG-15 during what you Americans call the ‘Korean War.’” The bustle of the hall intensified, most of their table getting up. “Ah, it seems that we’re going straight to the field. My name is Dimitry. Good to meet you comrade.”

Keith shook Dimitry’s hand and stood up, joining the masses with him as they filled out of the hall. “You too. Now what’s the deal with this ‘skjaldborg’ battle.”

Dimitry shrugged his shoulders with feigned indifference. “The shield wall. You’re not going to do well, as it's mostly an excuse for the oldest members of Valhalla to beat everyone else to a pulp.”

As the great tide of einherjar exited the hall, they were all handed various weapons and pieces of armor. Keith in particular was given a mail hauberk, a nasal helm, and a mail coif to put underneath the helmet. As for weapons, he was given a shield, a seax, and a winged spear. The shield was round and heavy, with a steel boss in the center. The seax on the other hand was a very strange beast, as it was a large knife meant for use in close situations. Of course, the spear needed little explanation, even though it was the most effective weapon in his possession.

The procession continued, Keith somehow managing to get all his gear in its proper place. Unfortunately, he became separated from his fellow pilots, eventually ending up in the far flank of the opposing side of the battle. There was what appeared to be millions of warriors on each side. He didn’t know how they had been drawn out of the hall so fast, though he suspected that it was linked to a combination of portal-like doors and non-euclidean spaces.

It was here that everything began to get strange, as he was forced to the front of the shield wall. Every person at the front had their shield overlapping the others, with the people behind them providing cover on the top. All in all, it was a very dependable arrangement, which lured him into a sense of false security. Now, he didn’t think that being in a shield wall was very scary. As with all things regarding Valhalla, Keith soon found himself incorrect.

The two armies neared each other, soon reaching projectile range. Both sides threw javelins and shot arrows at each other as opportunities presented themselves, Keith nearly being impaled by a Javelin that got stuck in the edge of his shield. He removed it with success, nearly getting hit again when an arrow stuck itself in the neighbor’s shield. “First time,” a man to the right of Keith asked.

“Yes.” Keith was quivering with anticipation. The two sides were marching closer yet again. He could nearly see the whites of his enemies eyes.

“You must be the new guy. Try no to wet your pants, flyboy.”

Keith turned his eyes towards the man who had just insulted him. He could feel the mead fueling anger where he'd usually be calm and collected. “Do you know what it’s like to fly as every gun in the city of Baghdad sets its sights on you? You’d piss yourself, but I sure wouldn’t.”

“You’ve never seen a single day of combat,” the man snarled. “You haven't seen the shield wall, let alone the trenches. You’re a yellow-bellied bastard who doesn’t know what it means to go to Valhalla.”

“Chill out,” a voice behind Keith interjected.

“What business have you getting into my conversation, Ted?” In the corner of his eye, Keith could see the women to his left (presumably a shieldmaiden) sign a cross over her breast, as if she knew something unfortunate was about to unfold.

“You’re provoking a teammate,” Ted continued, keeping a very calm demeanor to his voice. “I personally think that seven hundred and fourteen kills is quite impressive. It best serves to remind you that you best not underestimate someone because of their appearance.”

The other man did not respond, instead grumbling underneath the deadly stare emanating from Ted’s narrow face.

The shield walls grew closer yet again, within stabbing range of each other’s spears. Keith lashed out at the men opposite, though he found his spear would often glance off helmets or the edge of a colored shield. He was growing ever so uncomfortable as he was forced to move forward into the enemy, finding himself more and more claustrophobic as the two groups collided.

To fight in the shield wall was to experience pure fear. Keith found this to be entirely true as he cowered behind his shield. He was shoving with all his might against the other side, locked in a deadly struggle that tested his endurance far beyond what it was capable of. It was here where the blood began to spill.

The man next to Keith was speared through the chin, his gurgling scream being silenced as he was pushed over and trampled. Deadlocked and feeling the full force of adrenaline, Keith was stabbing in a blind fury, even as blood started dripping into his right eye. Most of his thrusts were cut short by the crowded conditions, though he managed to stab one guy in the face.

It was in this brutal melee that he lost his spear. So he drew his seax and shoved harder, his blade looking for the gut of any man who was foolish enough to expose themselves to the knife’s deadly reach. And a fool he found, his seax piercing mail as he thrust it into the man’s stomach and twisted, a guttural scream emerging from his victim as he pushed them over and trampled them. It was one of many screams. There were too many to count.

Keith’s side started losing ground, being pushed back by the larger masses of the enemy. And yet they killed, Ted stabbing at any face that dared show itself above Keith’s shoulders. The woman to his left was in a fury, though he could see that her shield was starting to droop. Keith’s movements began to get more frantic as he turned sluggish and uncoordinated. And yet he still felt the battle-daze, until he was stabbed in the shoulder.

Keith staggered back with a panicked yell, nearly losing his footing. But he was pushed back up by those behind him, so Keith once again pushed on his shield, a dull pain coming to fruition on his shield arm. He couldn’t understand much more from then on, even as he took numerous hits on his shield and mail. All he knew now was the crushing exhaustion as every muscle in his body burned with pain.

Keith couldn’t keep it up any longer. His throat burned as he sucked the sickly air in, hoping for any kind of respite. He was drenched in sweat and blood, staggering with every blow against him. He was near the end. His vision became fuzzy and started greying on the edges as every sound slowly turned into this incessant ringing that persisted through his exaggerated heartbeats.

In an instant, the enemy shield wall loosened as they broke through. The ringing intensified, and yet his shield wall still marched forward, slaughtering any remnants that dared to oppose them. It was in this final stretch that he lost consciousness, hitting the ground and being embraced by blackness once more.

Keith opened one eye, feeling nothing but the now oh so familiar pain as he moaned on the ground. His head dropped to the side, revealing the few figures left on the field. They were mopping up, slaughtering anyone stupid enough to try to stand up and fight again. After a few more lapses in and out of consciousness, he found himself inside of a hospital, battered and exhausted, but still functional.

This time, Keith was actually able to slide out of the bed’s cover and stand. His head was a little fuzzy, so he sat down again, attracting the attention of one of the resident nurses. “Wow, you’re recovering fast,” she started.

Keith looked her over, finding she was quite attractive. “You’re a Valkyrie, aren’t you?”

“Oh… you’re the new guy,” she looked down in disappointment. “Having seven hundred and fourteen kills, I’d think you’d be much taller.”

Keith stood up to his full height, which was about 6 feet tall. “I am. It’s just in the legs, otherwise my helmet would be scraping the top of the cockpit.”

Her eyes widened with worry. “You should sit down.”

“Fine.” Keith was getting dizzy again either way. He’d have to ease himself back to standing properly. “At least answer my question. Are you a Valkyrie or not?”

“Of course I am, though you shouldn’t assume that every doctor here is a Valkyrie. Some of your kind are combat medics. They usually help us keep to pace with the casualties. Even with magic and nanomachines, it’s still difficult to bring most of Valhalla back to their toes after huge battles like the one you were just in.”

“Huh.”

“You’re quite sharp. Not many people make the connection between Valkyries and the hospital for the first time, even though we quite literally serve you guys with both mead and medical expertise.” She patted his head.

Keith recoiled back. “Hey! Leave my hair alone.”

She looked down in embarrassment. “Sorry, but with wavy blonde hair like that I can’t help it.”

“Well, maybe you can tell me your name in return, Ms. Lack of Self Control.”

She sat down on the bed, her knee-length skirt straining to contain her hips. “Verity. That’s my name. And I assume that your name is Keith.”

Keith spread his hands in frustration. “How do you guys keep on figuring out my name? It’s not like I have it printed on my shirt or anything. And I’m not exactly going to stand out in a field of bodies.”

It’s not hard to miss your kind.” Verity moved her hand on Keith’s thigh, dangerously close to where it shouldn’t be. “Especially when most Valkyries really really like fighter pilots.”

“I’m not a goddamned fighter pilot. I’m a ‘Bandit.’ All of you should know by my kill count that F-117s aren’t fighters. They’re attack planes masqueraded as fighter jets because they need the expertise.”

Verity stood up, walking a storm around the room. “You didn’t have to blow me off like that.”

Keith got up as well, angrily pointing at Verity. “Maybe if you spent your time explaining how things worked around here instead of circlejerking to *Top Gun*, I’d actually be interested. But fucking no. I can’t acclimate with shit like this going on all around me! It’s my first day for Odin’s sake! Give a man a friggin break.”

“What!” Verity’s eyes widened. “How the hell did you know it was *Top Gun*!”

Keith released a disappointed stream of air from his nose as he twisted his head and looked down. “I’m more self-aware about my appearance than you may think.”

“All right then,” Verity continued, recomposing herself. “I can take you to your room, but we’re going to need this,” she unfolded a wheelchair, “because you probably won't be able to stand without it.”

Keith swiped his hand in front of him. “No fucking way. I’m walking.”

“Suit yourself, tough guy. At least put on some clothing.” She extracted a pair of jeans and a leather jacket along with all the other necessities from the top of a counter and gave them to Keith. Careful not to expose himself, he pulled on his pants underneath the hospital gown and threw it off, putting on the jacket last.

He would have resembled a very particular movie star if it weren’t for a long grey headband that he tied around his head. Verity groaned, trying to snatch it from his head. But Keith blocked her attempts, keeping his distance. She gave up, seething, “Where the hell did that come from! You just ruined your whole look.”

“Hehe,” Keith snickered. “Now all I need is a box.”

“What box! Come on, let’s get out of here already.” Verity escorted him out of the hospital room, bringing him to a sterile hallway that led to an elevator. Keith was beaming the whole time, taking a glance at Verity’s frustrated green eyes every now and then. What did she think she was, his babysitter? Valhalla was a place for warriors, not pansies.

The elevator opened upon arrival, filling the room with pleasant music when Verity pressed the “Dorms” button. It was one of the many buttons, some other important ones being “Main Hall,” and “Storage.” Pleasant music wasn’t an understatement. Valhalla’s elevator music was quality, consisting of iconic classical pieces.

The doors opened abruptly as the elevator stopped midway through their trip. Keith’s eyes widened as he suppressed his laugh. It was Valerie, and she was looking between him and Verity, connecting the dots in her brain as an inconvenienced look took her face. “Huh.”

Verity literally exploded, pointing her fingers at Valerie and seething, “You better keep your hands off him. He’s mine!”

“No, I don’t think I will.” Valerie turned her face to Keith’s. “Freya’s bounty is for all to share. Isn’t that right Keith?”

He took a somewhat neutral position, responding, “I guess so.”

Verity closed the distance between her and Valerie, getting into her face and nearly spitting with fury. “I told you! He’s miine! Mine! So take your flat ass out of here and leave!”

Keith deliberately pressed the “Storage” button on the elevator, finding that both the Valkyries were too distracted to notice his moves.

Valerie sighed. “Are you done throwing your temper tantrum yet?” She didn’t look too phased, being nearly a head taller than the woman beneath her. 

Verity flew into a rage, yelling insults and gesturing wildly as her brown hair came loose and coursed around her head.. Valerie took this punishment for a while, until she lost her cool when Verity insulted her chest. She socked Verity across the face right as *Ride of the Valkyries* began playing on the elevator’s sound system, bringing tears into her quarry's eyes as she shoved her back into the elevator’s wall.

Keith was able to leave the situation easily, exiting the elevator as the two fought and slipping inside a well-placed empty box. “Hrrng, Colonel,” Keith muttered to himself. “I’m trying to sneak past the guards, but they somehow managed to get into a catfight and they're blocking the elevator.” He snickered at what he had just said, attracting the attention of the two Valkyries as they stopped their fight and looked around for him.

“Where’d he go,” Verity whimpered, one of her eyes so swollen that it was barely able to widen with the sudden realization that she lost the whole reason she got into the fight.

Valerie snorted, wiping her sweaty hands off on Verity’s clothing. “All that just to lose him, bitch?”

“You fucking slut.” Verity yelped in pain as Valerie kicked her in the side.

“Cunt.” Valerie stormed off past Keith, disappearing into the labyrinth of the storage rooms. There were boxes with aging swords and rifles everywhere, along with other various forms of weaponry and armor. He swore he even saw a tank back there, though he didn’t want to explore any further since he was no longer eager to get into any kind of involvement with the Valkyries.

After a bit of crying (which Keith found very painful to hear), Verity picked herself up and took the elevator somewhere. Waiting a minute to ensure he had no other encounters, Keith stood up and dropped the box where he had found it. He had thought about comforting her, but had decided against it. The situation he had been in was quite volatile , so he thought it would be best to play neutral for the time being.

After descending the elevator to the dorms, Keith walked through the fine hallways. It must have been late at night, as few people were about. One of those few people was Ted, who had been taking notes in a small alcove. Keith moved on after taking a glance, deciding not to bother him. He eventually found his room, which was labeled “Room 42069, Keith Goodman.” He stared at the plaque, taking note of the number. He didn’t have any particular thoughts about it, other than an intense urge to say “nice.”

Keith’s eyes glanced to the left. Someone—no—some people were watching him, which he found very odd. He approached to investigate, seeing a man with an ugly scarred mug and a strip of gauze over his neck. Joining his side were three men who all looked like they had been pulled straight out of the Balkans.

Keith groaned in annoyance. “You bastard.”

“How’s it going flyboy, me and my mates got some bones to pick with ya.”

Keith stepped back, raising his arms in front of him and assuming a fighting position. “Can’t get a fucking break, can I?”

One of the Balkans edged forward towards Keith. “You bastard! You don't get a break when all you know how to do is drop paveways from the safety of your cockpit!”

“Cockpit,” one of the others snarled. “More like cocksucker.”

Keith backed up, careful not to cross his feet. The more distance he had, the better he’d be able to deal with neck gauze and his gang of Serbians. They were all shorter than him, probably having grown up malnourished.

Neck gauze moved forward with feigned confidence, growling, “We’ll either go rough ya or take you soft. Pick your poison, nightcock.”

“Enough with this shit,” Keith snapped. “You’re the one who’s going to get roughed up, asshole. ” With that, he lunged forward and threw the first punch.

Chapter 4

“Wow are you actually speaking English? I said to Trina.

“Yes, does that surprise you, Prisoner Erik?” She said with a grin. 

“Well, you’re the first of your kind that has been able to, since I’ve been a *guest* of yours. The other three all used some kind of translator.  It was weird.”

“Ah, the translator,” she said with a sigh. “Most of us don’t bother learning the languages of the planets we’re assigned to. However, more is expected of the daughter of a System Grand-Duchess.”

“Gotcha, well, why am I here?” I said back to her.

“I need to do a more comprehensive medical examination than the one that was done while you were unconscious. That one was to ensure you weren’t dying. As a member of the American Military, I doubt you have many, but we need to ensure we are adequately caring for any medical needs you may have.  We also need to ensure you are free from one of the only Infections that can transfer between our species.” She said with a professional sounding tone. 

“Sure, but if you were so worried about my health why did these brutes shock me, elbow me, and tie me up naked in a cell with no water?” I said with a glare.

“They did what!?” She said with a look of shock in her eyes. “Tell me everything that’s happened since you’ve been detained by us.”

While I was relaying all of my memories since the battle, she sat in her chair taking notes in her iPad thing, disgust and hate pouring from her eyes. 

“Most of what you told me is standard operating procedure for the Shil’Vati Military. However, hitting you In the face when you were already incapacitated, and keeping you unclothed in your cell were breaches of protocol. The women who did that to you will be punished accordingly.” She says, her tone not unlike my own Division Officer’s when discussing discipline. 

“Women!? Is everyone I’ve dealt with is a female?” I say with shock in my voice.

“Why yes, most of our species is female. Approximately 1/10 of our species is male. Most of our allied species have a similar gender disparity. Yours is the first we’ve met with anywhere close to 50% male and female, and even when it’s close it’s still majority female, among the species of the empire. My sisters in Xeno-studies have been having a blast gathering data about your species.” 

As she’s talking I look at her, taking the time to notice her features. She is stunning. I’m 6 ft. 4 inches and she towers over me. Her eyes were huge, with gold flakes &amp; a hint of blue shading. Her tusks just barely stick out of her mouth. They look as if they’ve been shaved down possibly? Black hair pulled into a bun similar to our grooming standards for women. A nose that could be considered small for her face, but most of the girls I’ve known would die for it. Lips big enough to notice them but not so massive they look fake. She’s...hot! Like a purple *Xena: Warrior Princess.*

“Prisoner Erik!” She snaps. “When I am talking you are to pay attention to every word that comes out of my mouth, or I’ll have your guards come back in and teach you a lesson in manners. Got it?”

“Yes, ma’am.” I said quickly, and snapped my attention back to her words. 

“Now, I need you to disrobe for my medical examination.  There is a gown hanging on the rack to your right.”  She said, as she walked behind a curtain, seemingly there for the modesty of her patients. 

I peeled off the painted-on clothes I was wearing, and put the gown on. It had more room than the clothing I had just exited, but it was just a little short. So short my junk would’ve shown if a slight draft blew through. 

*I gotta ask her about different clothes when this is over.*

I cleared my throat and said “I’m ready.” 

She popped back out of the curtain with a slightly disappointed look in her eye. 

“We might as well get the hard part over with first. Please stand on the € and lift up your robe.” Trina said, sounding almost mischievous.

She pulled out the thickest Q-tip I’ve ever seen, and before I could even process what she was doing, grabbed my penis, and stuck the q-tip in my dick-hole. 

“OOOOOOWWWWWWWWW” I Yelped. 

“You’re my tenth patient so far and the first to react that poorly.” She said coldly. “Now on to the easier parts. Please have a seat” 

“There are 9 other humans here?  Are they from my ship?” I said, desperately.

“You will find out soon enough about your fellow humans. However, we have work to do.” 

She checked my reflexes, blood pressure, took samples of my blood, my vision, did a psychological exam, something like a Rorschach test, and after having me get dressed again, a physical fitness test. 

————————————————————————

“How are our humans coming along?” The commander said, to her chief medical officer in their native Shil’Vati. 

“They have all passed their medical exams.
However, there is one Human that, despite having a rather mundane career, is exceptional.” Said Dr. Trina to her superior. “He is the tallest among our prisoners, his IQ scored off the charts, and his fitness assessment puts him right in line with our prisoners from *Special Operations*, despite being a glorified gunsmith for his primary role.“

“Let’s take a look” the Princess said. 

After a couple seconds of the Princess making hand signals, a hologram popped up.  It was a 3D image of Erik, in his birthday suit, surrounded by data, all written in Shil’Vati runic script. She continued making hand signals to extrapolate more data from the hologram. 

“Maybe it’s time for us to meet.  Bring him in.” Said the Princess.

Any sane person should know that they’ve screwed up when they’re facing four angry men in a hallway. But Keith didn’t exactly screw up. He could have never known that he’d later be thrown into Valhalla when he sought a successful career as a pilot. Furthermore, there was no way he could possibly surmise that the people he’d killed at some point would come back to haunt him.

Nonetheless, Keith had decided to start the fight on his own initiative. If you wanted to be the best, you needed to work for it, and Keith wasn’t exactly going to let these four degenerates simply roll him over and have their way. At this point, he was rightly sick of letting everyone else have their way with him.

And so he threw the first jab, aiming for the nose of the gang’s ringleader. Neck gauze threw his arms up pathetically, failing to block the blow to his nose. Disorientated, Keith’s quarry blindly threw a haymaker in his last known position. It missed, Keith already closing the gap as he thrust his knee into his enemy’s crotch and cut his legs out from underneath him.

Neck Gauze lay on the floor moaning, clutching his groin with both hands. His henchmen were still frozen in place, not really sure what to do until one made a move towards Keith. Finishing the job, Keith kicked the downed man in the ribs several times and leapt back, keeping his distance from the other three.

Unlike their leader, they were working together, careful not to make any foolish moves like exposing themselves. All three assumed fighting stances, approaching Keith in a very aggressive fashion. Over the surprise from earlier, they were attempting to surround him so they could attack him from every angle.

Keith felt like a corned animal, his heart pounding with adrenaline as his eyes snapped between his three quarries. He was looking for the one who was most vulnerable, but he found that none of them had any significant weaknesses in their defenses. None of them had their legs crossed, their guard too low, nor a wide stance. The best Keith could do is attack the one farthest from their friends, angling his target so they blocked the others.

Keith did just that, skirting around his target and testing their defenses with another jab. He was blocked, his opponent taking his blow on the arm and striking back, hitting Keith’s left shoulder. He seethed in pain, his shoulder flaring with pain as the spear wound opened up again. Seeing an opportunity to hurt Keith's vulnerable shoulder again, his opponent swung at him once more.

Keith easily deflected the blow. Finding an opening below his opponent’s now vulnerable defense, Keith struck him in the gut, his quarry doubling over. Before he could recover, Keith attempted to kick him in the crotch as well. But his opponent had retreated by then, his two friends soon taking his place.

Both took turns at attacking, Keith’s arms bruising from the punches while he shrugged off the kicks. As long as he protected his more vulnerable parts of his body, he’d mostly be fine, though his instincts said otherwise. Deep down, he knew he was tiring and getting sluggish. His attempts to keep his position safe from any grappling were slowly failing, though he still managed to block and dodge the flurry of hits coming his way.

A punch got past Keith’s guard, slamming into Keith’s weak shoulder. He staggered back, trying to distance himself. But it was already too late. His guard was open, and the next one hit him square in the nose, disorientating Keith as his eyes teared. He lashed out blindly, trying to hit flesh but only finding air. He was completely panicked now, quickly losing all of his composure. In other words, Keith had accidentally baked the recipe for defeat.

Keith’s legs were swept out from underneath him, his arms flailing out in an attempt to soften his fall. It was of no use though, as he still slammed into the ground square on his back, gasping as the air escaped his lungs. He rolled over, wheezing, trying to get up onto all fours. But he was swiftly thwarted, being viciously kicked back into the floor as pain shot through his ribs.

Keith moaned in distress, curling into the fetal position as he was kicked from every side. The blows did not relent, finding the small of his back, his legs, his neck, and his arms. Bruised and bloody, he held the pain as long as he could. But it only got worse. Taking a boot to the head, Keith cried out, squirming around in agony. Unfortunately his actions were futile, as their cruelties only intensified.

It seemed that Valhalla was a place where the fallen brutally murdered the fallen over past grievances. But you couldn’t die in Valhalla. If they could bring a person back from Earth, then the process would be much easier in Valhalla. With this realization, Keith broke into hysteria, his wheezing laughter continuing even after he was struck again and again. Keith was here to stay, and he knew that he’d find his retribution eventually.

All of a sudden, the barrage of feet ceased, Keith’s enemies taking a different position as someone unexpected approached them. He rolled over, taking a look at the man who dared approach the four antagonists. He was of mid height, with a narrow face and well-kept brown hair. Ted had returned to finish the job.

Neck Gauze cursed, still limping from Keith’s blows. “That shithead’s back. Lets fuck him up, he’s goddam suck-up and an American.”

“Aight boss,” one of the henchmen replied, carefully approaching Ted.

Ted folded a pair of spectacles and dropped his notebook on the floor, the clap of it smacking the ground breaking the silence as he pulled a metal pen out of his well-kept suit. He sighed, as if he were dealing with another bother in his figures, and then bolted into action.

With amazing agility, Ted crossed the distance between him and the first hooligan within a split second, savagely smashing the man’s head against the wall and plunging his pen into their neck. The body slumped to the floor, Ted carefully extracting his pen and wiping it off with a handkerchief.

The other three hooligans froze in place, staring at the body and the puddle of blood around its neck. Ted gingerly stepped over the body, not a single mark of filth finding its way onto his suit.

As his assaulters made way for their attack again, Keith made his way onto his knees, grunting in pain as he fell spread eagled onto the floor. But he tried again, hatred determining him to get up and finish the fight even as his bruised muscles struggled to pick him up.

Meanwhile, Ted was engaging all three, stabbing one of the perpetrators through the leg when they foolishly attempted to kick him. Still acting with brainless determination, they kept their fighting posture and carefully avoided leaving themselves vulnerable to the bloodied pen’s wicked reach as they threw punches at Ted.

His foes entertained by one man of badass proportions, Keith took the initiative and limped towards the wounded henchman. Not having alerted his attention, Keith thrust his knee into his assailant’s rectum and stomped the back of their calf as they folded over. The resulting blow left them on the floor, gasping in pain as Keith faced the next opponent.

Neck Gauze was consumed by fury, charging forward and slamming into Keith’s chest. They both crashed into the floor, Keith ending up on the bottom as they scrambled for the advantageous position. But Keith had wanted to end up below, in just the right position to strangle his antagonist.

Fueled by wrathful adrenaline, Keith punched his right arm underneath Neck Gauze’s chin, connecting both arms in a vice-like grip as he squeezed his enemy’s neck into his own forearm. He held the position for what felt like an eternity until his quarry slumped over. Just to be sure, Keith held his chokehold, but he soon relented, extracting himself from the assailant’s limp body.

The other two aggressors lay on the ground, the one Keith had gotten to cowering in fear as his accomplice lay sprawled with a bloody hole within his sunken chest. It faintly whistled, assuring his death as he lay unconscious. Above all them stood Ted, who was once again wiping off his pen with his handkerchief.

Ted offered a hand to Keith, which he graciously accepted, having barely the capacity to walk or even get up. “It seems we haven’t properly met. My name is Ted. Ted the accountant.”

“My name’s Captain Keith Goodman,” Keith answered in response. “Good to meet you Ted.”

“In due time I see,” Ted gestured towards the men on the floor. “It’s scum like this that keep me from completing my work. Valhalla isn’t going to pay for itself, especially when these fools think it’s a good idea to give you a thrashing while I’m nearby.”

Keith groaned at the mention of the thugs. “They certainly deserved it. I hope they enjoy waking up in the hospital bed without any dignity.” With sudden realization, Keith looked around, finding his room’s door and slowly limping towards it.

“You need a hand,” Ted asked, noticing Keith's wounded gait.

“No.” Keith turned the door, revealing a massive room. Looking back into the hallway, he found that each door was about ten feet away from each other, while his room was nearly the size of an entire house.

Ted noted Keith's reaction, explaining, “That’s Valhalla for you.”

“It doesn’t make sense.” The non-euclidean spaces were back at it again, messing with Keith’s perception of reality, “I can’t imagine what it’d be like running into something like this in the air.”

“Can’t tell you, Keith. I don’t fly. You could ask the rest of your buddies tomorrow though.”

Weary of attempting to make sense of the size of his room and the distance between the other rooms, Keith staggered inside until he slumped onto a couch. Ted followed, Keith asking, “Do you know anything about this place really? I haven’t quite gone through the ropes yet.”

“You probably know why you’re here, in service of Odin in Valhalla. There are many other gods, too many to name in a single sentence. So I’ll start with the basics, with ones you’ll recognize.”

“First comes Sol, the goddess of the stars. Then there’s Mani, the god of the moon and other satellites. And there’s Tyr, the god of honor, justice, and the rules of war. Most important is Allfather Odin, husband of Freya and the King of Asgard, who is the god of art, chaos, wisdom, and much more. Next comes the mighty Thor, the god of lightning, the sky, and thunder. Freya comes next, being Odin’s wife and the goddess of fertility, foresight, and war. And finally, there’s Sif, the wife of Thor and the goddess of agriculture, marriage, and nature.”

“Huh,” Keith started, scratching the back of his neck in wonder. “So there’s a god for every day of the week?”

“That’s right. There are many more gods, and much more to the ones I covered, though you’ll be lucky if you get to meet two within your time here in Valhalla.”

“I assume I’d have to pray to Thor then, since I’m a pilot, flying within his domain.”

“Sounds about right. You might want to talk a bit to your fellow pilots about that as well, as there could be some caveats.” Ted checked his watch, and then folded his notebook, which he had been scrawling notes in while he’d been talking to Keith. “It’s about time for me to leave. I have a few personal words of wisdom for you though. Don’t let everyone roll over you. You can’t show compassion without first showing cruelty.”

Keith nodded in Ted’s direction. “Good day then, Ted. Thanks for saving my ass.”

“You’re welcome.” Ted strode out the door. “And farewell.” He closed the door behind himself, leaving Keith alone to himself in his living space.

Keith looked at himself, observing the many bruises, cuts, and streaks of dried blood that ran over his arms. Pulling up a pant leg, he could see even more, the blue and purple spots running up his aching legs. “Oh crap,” Keith said to himself, looking around the room. “Where’s the bathroom?”

Looking around, Keith recognized many of the features in the large room. There was a kitchen, living area, and even an office space along with the ever so necessary king-sized bed. He had a feeling that it would probably be used for more than just resting. After scanning the room and its modest, yet comfy and well made furnishings, Keith spotted a door that must have led into the bathroom.

He groaned in agony as he straightened his stiff legs and staggered towards the door. He twisted the handle, putting his weight on it and pushing it inside. The bathroom, like the rest of his quarters, was also modest in design. There were no unnecessary gilded inlays, nor any random paraphernalia lining the counters. In fact, the most grandiose piece in the bathroom was its tub, which was about the size of a jacuzzi.

Turning the nozzles of the tub and filling the room with the roaring of cascading water, Keith slowly extracted himself from his clothing. After finishing, he leaned in front of the mirror and stared at himself. His face was a swollen mess stained with crimson. His shoulder was aflame, the gauze pad stuck on it flushed with dried blood. And worst yet, he was spotted like a cheetah, though the spots were the ugly discolored hues of bruises instead of the regal blacks of the aforementioned feline.

To sum it all up, Keith felt and looked like shit. So he gingerly stepped inside of the tub, slowly lowering himself until he could slide down along one of its gentle curved walls. He sat there, soaking all but his head, enjoying the near-scalding heat of the water as he rejuvenated his strength. He would need it. So far as Keith knew, you couldn’t get a break in Valhalla. Perhaps it was for the best that he got the harsh introduction.

Looking back on what had happened earlier, he found himself surprised to think that he had just gone through the worst time of his life after death. With how amalgamated his new home was, he couldn’t expect any better. From Valkyrie feuds that probably revolved around much more than who was escorting Keith, to an unhinged elder god that claimed to have been inside a black hole, there was probably more lying in wait for Keith.

After spending about an hour in the water, Keith scrubbed himself and left the water. He put on the basics, a simple t-shirt and a pair of track pants, wandering around the room, looking for something to do to put his mind at rest before he went to sleep. After a brief search, he found a book called “The Complete and Utter Doofus’s Guide to Valhalla” and a computer in the office space. Thinking that it’d be a better idea not to humiliate himself, he pressed the computer’s power button.

“Holy crap,” Keith exclaimed, noticing that the computer was already on the login screen after a complete boot up. After clicking the login button, he was brought to an unfamiliar background that featured a rolling green hill underneath a cloudy blue sky. Keith’s eyes widened in shock. On the bottom right corner, it read 11:37 PM, Odin’s Day, January 23, 2008. He quickly popped open the browser and searched “Time Dilation,” remembering what Odin had said earlier.

“What the hell? The faster you go, the faster time passes?” Keith facepalmed. “Who the heck is this Obama guy? Why are we in Afghanistan and Iraq? What the fuck happened to the twin towers?” Keith stopped his internet searches, closing the browser. Then he popped it open again. “Hell yeah!” He pumped his fist into the air. There were two new *Metal Gear* games, and in an instant he had them on the computer.

Keith didn’t have much experience with computer games, only having played a well-known shooter in years past. But he was still optimistic, knowing that he’d easily adapt to the controls. With his worries out of the way and fun on the horizon, Keith launched the game and got to gaming. There was nothing better than playing as a badass in a nonexistent world when he wasn’t one himself in his current existence.

Hello everyone. This one's a little shorter than usual, mostly because there really isn't anything I an add without starting another chapter. I don't know when the next one will be out, though I hope to have it done by Friday (or more properly Freya's Day) noon. It's a little bit rough right now, as I haven't done much in editing so far. Feel free to comment on my errors.

Choosing between having both Freya and Frigg or combining them was a difficult choice, as there is evidence that Frigg (Odin's wife in the more recent adaptations of Norse Mythology) is actually Freya due to name changes over time and their overlapping roles. I also decided to change Saturday (derived from Saturn, a Roman God) to Sif's Day, as it made more sense for the Norse Pantheon to reject any Roman influences and embrace their own.",/r/HFY/comments/lqtn9x/welcome_to_valhalla_chapter_three_bruised_and/,28

**Chapter 96: Dealings**

“Why are you so nice?” Ray finally questioned not letting go of Sapphire who looked up at Dakota not sure how to answer that one as they sat behind Tiguan. It had been a while, the time being passed mostly with funny stories and general chit-chat.

“People can be arseholes for a lot of reasons, for Tiguan here it’s because of how he looks, for our three friends here and the Flaxens it's because of what they know and did. With You, I’m afraid it's because it’s easy.” Yildiz replied, sounding a tad somber-looking up at Tiguan. “Hell remember when I was assigned to you at first?” He continued, looking up to Tiguan.

“You were so mad… I honestly thought my mother had killed your parents or something” Tiguan replied, reluctantly not taking his eyes of Ray. “She was an arsehole though”

“Yeah the world wasn’t nice to her, so she’s not nice to the world. You're doing well though. I was a little scared I Just got your mother in a scaled-down package”

“Thanks” Tiguan replied disinterestedly as Ray looked up. “What did they do to you?”

“Oh it’s not too bad, I just don’t go out during the day much. I sneak around scavenging what I need and take it back home. I guess I’m an arsehole to actually” Ray tried with the most cautious of smiles.

“You’re a thief?” Tiguan questioned, as if not understanding at all. “But thieves are bad guys?” The dragon went, as Ray scooted back on the ground a bit eye’s going wide again.

“I… I don’t want to. it’s not easy I swear I don’t want to”

“Don’t worry it’s fine we understand” Ylditz replied, interposing himself clearly trying to calm her down before turning to Tiguan. “We talked about this big boy. Not necessarily, okay”

“Sorry... No please don’t cry” The dragon replied looking to Ray.

She did keep it together, just. Coming over and Leaning into Sapphire, Tiguan looking at the ground slightly ashamed. “Sorry”

“Oh, would you two stop apologizing” Victoria added, sounding less than impressed. “Neither of you did anything wrong, nor are you arseholes.”

“They want the three from Bizmati Keep,” a voice called out from behind the big black breathing barrier. It was such an odd feeling to feel safe hiding behind something so damn scary looking.“Sometime today I think.”

‘Yeah, we heard you the first time wanker,’ Sapphire cursed to herself.

“It’s one of the guards,” Tiguan relayed down to them helpfully after taking a look. “Should I try to scare him too?” he tried looking to Ray, as if he wanted her opinion.

“No, don’t bother. This is our fight and he’s not the target” Dakota replied after a second of Ray looking around confused.

“Right, you stay here, Ray. We need to go sort this out,” Sapphire went, giving her a slight slap on the shoulder.

“Good luck,” the timid reply came as Sapphire got to her feet, turning to walk back around Tiguan. “It’s all true, right?” Ray questioned delicately, hope clear in her voice. “What you said earlier”

“Every word of it. He can’t fly and never could,” Sapphire clarified, looking back to the cripple. “Yet his people fly anyway. They just need a little help. Not to mention he’s damn near a hero,” she continued with a wink as she continued to walk. Sapphire had guessed if anything could cheer up a cripple like Ray It had to be stories of someone who could never fly in the first place and it seems she had been right.

“I still don’t get that,” Tiguan added, sounding like he had just given up trying to understand it, a sentiment Sapphire wholeheartedly supported.

That mindset might not have helped her in trying to explain the crazy human’s stories, but that hardly mattered. Ray had looked like she had completely forgotten the shitshow going on around her. It wasn't till Saph was in the middle of the story that she realised the unhappy ending on the horizon. Ray was likely gonna be staying here. There was no place for a cripple at a frontier keep. Saph knew that as well as anyone. She just couldn’t bear to tell Ray that though, she was smiling, and properly smiling at that. Even if it was not going to last, she at least deserved a bit of happiness for what she had done for them. Perhaps she and Tiguan could arrive at a happy ending some day, Sapphire at least hoped so.

As Sapphire cleared Tiguan she saw Balethon who had been doing his best to win a staring contest with some of the Flaxens, the odd insult and accusation thrown in for good measure on both sides.

“Follow on Bale boy, I’m sure their eyes don’t work anyway” Sapphire went as they passed him.

He didn't break eye contact with the current target though he joined up behind Saph and Dakota walking up the stairs to the mansion.

“Follow me please, and do wipe your feet on the mat,” the Flaxen guard went as he turned away to go inside.

“I guess we shouldn’t be surprised they can’t even teach the doorman manners?” Dakota replied, feigning disappointment. “Was it you who escorted the little piece of shit to the warehouse this morning?”

“No ma’am, I do my job, which means making you wipe your feet.”

“You're doing a shitty job then,” Sapphire added, making a point of going around the doormat, Balethon following her lead. Dakota did at least wipe them half-heartedly. The guard didn’t seem to care though, not even turning to look at them as he led the way down the corridors.

The inside was exactly as Sapphire had expected, precious metals used everywhere, thick luxurious carpets, paintings of people looking stupid decorating the walls and various doubtlessly expensive things on display everywhere. There were a few actually nice paintings though.

It wasn’t much of a walk, and the guard was clearly taking them straight somewhere, rather than leading them around to show off the mansion like Sapphire had anticipated. They ended up at what Saph would describe as a lounge. There was a low set table with sofas around it, on which Victoria and Captain Bruno could be found, sitting opposite Jamila and this Nevera, whom was still in chains.

Jamila looked very serious and more contemplative, unlike the previous angry snarling face she had worn, and Nevera had clearly been crying for whatever reason. Sapphire pulled a slight smile at that. ‘Looks like someone learned about the consequences of one’s actions.’

“You called for us,” Dakota opened, respectfully, standing at attention.

“Yes, take a seat please,” Jamila replied, her tone as serious as her expression, waving away the guard. The trio did as instructed, setting down on the very nice comfy sofa.

“Would you mind repeating your statement?” Victoria then went, her eyes locked on the manacled woman sitting across from her.

“I was tasked with hiring the mercenaries by the Lady herself… I did it.” She replied not looking up from the floor

“And why did you do it?” Jamila snapped, clearly not happy right now.

“She promised to make me next in line if I did.” The woman continued beginning to sob into her hands. Sapphire could hardly feel sorry for her, though it did present an interesting conundrum in regards to the rest of the Flaxen family.

“And yours, Jamila?” Victoria continued, switching her gaze to the older woman.

“I sent Abberline to try and bribe you into dropping the charges. That was decided by the family council… This was not. How could you! You have ruined us! You selfish little brat!”

Sapphire began wondering if this was all a stage show, if so they were doing a good job acting. The bitch had pulled too much shit like this all ready for her to believe this bullshit blindly though.

“So then you're blaming this all on her or what?” Sapphire questioned coldly, glaring at Jamila.

“And our Lady. She is apparently the one who ordered this.”

“Yes, she told me to. I can’t disobey her, we have to obey her,” Nevera pleaded, jumping at the excuse.

“She is in prison, and the family council has been making those decisions since that happened. Which you damn well knew!” Jamila snapped back.

“So you are admitting guilt on behalf of her and the Lady but not the family as a whole?” Dakota questioned, looking at Jamila.

“On the matters of the kidnapping, yes.”

“And on the matters of what your Lady did before that?”

“That will be decided at the trial. For which I hope we will not be present.”

“What’s that supposed to mean?” Balethon questioned. Sapphire would like to know that too actually.

“Having these charges leveled against us cannot be allowed. It simply cannot. The matter will have to be placed in the hands of the family council since I am not yet the lady of our family,” Jamila replied, shooting a sharp look at Nevera. “Though there is widespread agreement that, as I said, these charges must not hit our family. And especially so if they are found to be true”

“You didn’t answer the question though?” Balethon tried again, sounding a tad annoyed.

“We are gonna ex-communicate both of them and whoever aided them. We will wash our hands of this mess and be done with it,” Jamila replied, looking to Balethon like he really should have been able to figure that out.

“You do realize that as she is the lady of your family and went to Bizmati Keep representing your family. Not to mention bringing several family members with her. Many of the charges are against you as a family and not her as an individual,” Victoria joined in, receiving an approving nod from Dakota.

“I am acutely aware. That is the situation must be resolved before the trial. Hopefully, we can come to an agreement on that front.”

“Are you gonna try to bribe us again?” Balethon questioned in a joking tone. That set the gears turning in Sapphire’s head.

“Wait, how the fuck could you not know she tried to kill Essy? There were several of your family members present as eyewitnesses!” Sapphire demanded, the realization having clicked. She must have known, yet Abberline had claimed she had no idea. “Abberline said you thought she assaulted Essy, not tried to kill her!? Yet you had to know, you especially,” Sapphire continued, pointing at Nevera. “You were there!”

“I mean, she did assault her,” The woman meekly tried to defend herself.

“With a deadly weapon, intending to kill. Pretty big fucking difference! It’s called attempted murder you dipshit,” Sapphire replied. Jamila snapped her head at the manacled women, clearly expecting an explanation.

“We needed the support of the family,” was all the answer they got from Nevera.

“We?” Victoria questioned, very pointedly.

“You traitorous little group of rats!” Jamila interrupted before Nevera could muster a reply. “You lied to your own family!? You dared lie to me!”

“And you abandoned your Lady. If anyone is the traitor here it’s you. You’re only doing this because you're next in line. So don’t act so damn righteous, you're just a scheming old skank.”

‘What a fucking shit show,’ Sapphire concluded, as the two of them descended into an enthusiastic shouting match.

After a little over a minute, Victoria interrupted the duel, with a loud “HEY!” which did get their attention, at least somewhat. “You mentioned you wanted the charges against the family as a whole dropped. How do you imagine that happening?”

“I do not know, since it's up to the family council, but my plan is for you to get the Lady and the justice you apparently crave so much and we won’t try to stop it. Make no mistake, we can keep these trials going for years if necessary. I doubt you have the time nor funds for that,” Jamila replied, looking at Dakota.

“No, but we do,” Victoria interjected, coldly. “We will get them anyway even if it takes a little longer. So what are you offering""

“Well then, what do you propose then?” Jamila questioned, clearly not pleased with that response.

“We take you to court, seek compensation for all the strife you have caused us, and get your Lady and Nevera here, as well as anyone who saw fit to help them, locked away for as long as possible, not to mention ruining your family's reputation forever” Dakota stated matter of factly which gave Jamila a very cold hard look as she tried to stare down Dakota.

“In that case I think we can come to an agreement. Though this is not a discussion I have the authority to have with you. Colonel, would you allow us to convene a meeting of our family council to make a proper decision on this subject? In private.”

Victoria looked to Dakota, clearly waiting for her opinion.

“Well, you have admitted guilt. You can’t run from that, and we will slaughter you all if you try something stupid. I can agree to that,” Dakota replied, putting an emphasis on slaughter, which clearly sank in with Jamila. Victoria turned her head back to the solemn-looking woman, giving her a slight nod.

“Very good, I would have Nevera testify before our council too. Though that meeting will be for our family only.”

“In lieu of your confessions, I will allow you to hold this private meeting, though I must reiterate we have you now. So don’t try anything brash, like Dakota said that would cost you very dearly.” Victoria replied, getting to her feet.

“How's he doing?” someone asked. Tom really didn’t have the mental wherewithal to recognize the voice. He tried opening his eyes just to check whether he could still see something; much to his delight, it didn’t seem to have gotten that much worse. Though he probably would have struggled to notice any small changes anyway.

“He’s in a hell of a lot of pain, but we are doing what we can. We can keep this up for a few hours with two of us switching.”

“It will buy him more time, but we have no clue if it’s enough.”

“I have this, would it help?”

“What even is that? Wait how long have you had this?”

“I don’t know… Uli got it for me. I think we were supposed to share it.”

“Oh my… I mean it’s alcohol, right?”

“As far as I know at least. I never dared drink it alone.”

“You have… actual alcohol?” Tom tried, biting in the pain of speaking.

“I mean… Quin do you think it would be smart? And it was so expensive.”

“Do you really want to put a price on saving his ass after what he did?”

“I didn’t mean it like that. What if it doesn't work, or makes it worse.”

“What is it?” Tom went, trying to get a look at them and failing horribly as the pain of moving shot through him.

“Uhm it’s called wild brew… it’s not for the faint of heart.”

“Is it alcohol? Good stuff, not homebrew?”

“It’s from the capitol.”

“Has it been opened?”

“No never, it’s wax sealed”

“Then pretty please, I really don’t like dying right now?” Tom replied, doing his best not to let the annoyance show.

“What if it makes it worse though?”

“He’s getting worse and worse. and they won’t be back until the middle of the night at best. We are just buying time, not fixing it.”

“It’s only been two hours?!” Tom let out much to his regret as he gasped in pain.

“Let’s try it, sit him up again.” ‘Oh god no,’ Tom cursed to himself as he felt them help him up to sit. The pain was excruciating, and his combination of lightheadedness and the crushing headache definitely didn’t help things. If nothing else, the alcohol might just help with that.

Tom heard a cork being removed, and shortly after a cup of some really strange smelling liquid was held up in front of him. “Here you go. Now, we don’t know how this will affect you, but things might get a little strange.”

“Oh this sounds like a great idea,” Tom tried jokingly, sniffing the cup. There was definitely alcohol in there and not a small amount; he had no idea what the rest of those smells were though. “Here goes nothing.”

“How are they doing out there?” Sapphire questioned Balethon as he returned to the lounge.

“They are doing good. Ray was actually petting him, if you would believe it. She didn’t want to come inside though… Are they still at it?”

Sapphire didn’t need to reply, as another series of loud shouts rang out from the room.

“Honestly they could just as well have invited us to take part if they are gonna shout like that,” Dakota went, shaking her head.

“Do any of you also think it’s all just for show? I mean, they had to know the Lady did it.” Sapphire tired again. She just couldn't believe it would be this easy.

“It might be, but what do we want? Aside from the Lady’s head on a pike or getting her locked up forever of course.”

“What about their house? I wouldn't mind living here,” Balethon replied.

“They need to stop coming after us, that's for sure,” Sapphire added. “And money is always nice.”

“We just want them humiliated, though they seem to have fixed that on their own. Additionally, we want some very public apologies, but that would likely follow the ex-communication anyway,” Victoria added, seeming quite pleased.

Sapphire couldn’t help but feel burning this place to the ground would be nice. But bleeding them dry would be good too. “How about having all of the Lady’s entourage thrown in prison? That would be good.”

“They didn’t do much apart from lie to us and their family. Hardly prison worthy, almost a shame they didn’t get a chance to spout those lies to the court,” Victoria replied.

“Food’s here,” one of the Hashaw family guards went as he and another guard came walking over with a variety of packages.

“Oh yes. Thank you, I'm starving. What time is it even?” Balethon questioned, sitting up on the sofa.

“Early afternoon,” one of the guards replied.

“And we still haven't heard from home,” Sapphire added, looking to Dakota.

“No, we have not,” Dakota replied, giving a polite nod to the guard as she took her package.

As Sapphire took her package, she could honestly not figure out what to make of all this. Things weren’t right back home, and she couldn’t help but feel things were going too smoothly here. Sure it had been a night from hell. But they had found the kidnappers, gotten confessions, and now had the Flaxen family taking turns screaming at each other next door while they ate a delicious, if very late, breakfast.

“I take it that means Jarix hasn’t returned from his scouting run?” Victoria questioned, looking at Dakota.

“No, and they should have been back yesterday at the very latest.”

“I don’t know what kind of threat could hit a frontier keep that could bring down a dragon, not to mention your little demon.” The guard, handing out the food, added.

“Tom,” Victoria clarified, looking at her. “He’s quite insistent on that front. Still, this is concerning, You are sure your little earpiece is working?”

“I talked with my mother only last night, it was working beautifully”

“Troubling… We might have to send that messenger anyway then.”

“So... how are you doing, Tom?”

“I… I saee preewty… pweety pink uwnycorn dacing ooon rainwose”

“He’s not getting better, is he?”

“Nope, but he’s a lot more lively now, and he’s certainly seeing something. Do we give him more?”

“Let’s hold off till he starts complaining again. I think we might have already overdone it.”

“I think I would drink heavy draughts if my life depended on it too.”

“No, I no complain I ciritimezise.”

“Well he can still hear us, can you see us too?”

A hand came waving in front of Tom's face, it was going so fast, wait no that’s not a hand, it’s white... that’s Jacky! “Hehe. Jacky go neeowwwn, race race reace.”

“I guess that’s a yes. Do you think he snapped or something?”

“I mean, if he snapped it’s like a branch, not a twig, that’s for sure.”

“Fly fly little Jacky… where did she go weeeee to?”

“I would say shattered like a glass window on stone floors.”

“Do we need to start with the liver again? I mean it’s been a while, but there’s still a long time till anyone gets here even in the best case scenario.”

“Hours long, time short. Jacky Jacky wuuhoo.”

“That hurts like hell for him though. Do you think he might try to kill us if we did that?”

“He’s unarmed and weak; he's not even slightly scary right now.”

“Yeah, but he's crazy or something. Can we fix that somehow?”

“Look at pwretty colours, oohh not knowy that onee whoaaa.”

“How the hell do you fix that? Oh shit, Nunuk is gonna kill me if he survives like this.”

“Relax, it’s the drink. It will wear off soon enough.”

“Ye yeah dum læge, du en dumpap.”

“I have no idea what that means, but we are gonna have to do something… Should we try putting him to sleep? It might keep him from going more crazy.”

“Or he might not wake up again.”

“Would you please stop saying things like that? Jacky did it I’m sure, and he will be fine too.”

“He He Jacjky prewty no bad Tom, bonk horny Jailsy.”

“Let’s just not give him any more for a bit and see what happens, okay?”

But he said he needed a small dose every now and again.”

“Then we down the dosage a little. If it gets worse then we hibernate his liver again and pray for the best okay?”

Neu Vieumau Joint Occupation Zone

Vix couldn’t help but smile as Raiden rattled off about his day so far. She rarely got to see him this happy and animated, but it really did seem like his day had gone very well so far. If he could actually keep this job it would be great for him. A few credits here and there would go a long way. Plus, giving him something to do just seemed like an added benefit. She didn’t mind him hanging around the dorms all the time, but if he actually had credits it would really open up what he could do with her and the other wards.

“So, where is the cultural exchange building from here?” Ramirez asked just as he pulled the jeep to a stop before the pawn shop.

“Oh, go back up the road. Left. Two blocks. Left. Halfway up, also on the left.” Vix pointed back the way they’d come from and explained how to get there.

“Left left left. Can’t really fuck that up right Sarge?” Tim asked.

“I’m positive you could fuck up anything specialist Taylor.” Ramirez growled back.

“Either way, thanks for the ride! I hope you find… er… well I guess I hope you don’t find a bomb?” Vix frowned a little as she tried to think about how to phrase it. “I hope you find that there isn’t a bomb and it was bad intel. Is that better?” She looked between the two marines.

“We get the sentiment, and thanks kid.” Tim nodded while she and Raiden hopped out of the vehicle. Even with the front passenger seat now open Tim didn’t move up, instead he leaned back a bit and waved his hand in the head. “Oh chaufer, drive me around the block.”

“Fuck off.” Ramirez growled out even as Raiden and Vix couldn’t help but giggle. They watched the marine turn the jeep around, being careful not to hit Mr. Murizi’s old van across the street. Tim waved then as they drove off and Vix waved back. Should she have talked to them about finding her brother? The idea hit her a moment too late and she took half a step to try and chase them before she figured it was better to just… ignore it and try later. Turning back to Raiden she glanced up at the pawn shop before them.

“So he gave you those boots?” She asked, her tail giving a few tentative twitches in curiosity.

“Well, he gave me coupons for I think normal boots. Or shoes. But then the Void people gave me these. Everyone is super jealous. They’re so great.” Raiden grinned wide at her as he held a foot up in the air and wiggled the boot.

“And he’s going to pay you to deliver boxes?” She checked.

“Yeah. Oh! We could get you a job too!” Raiden then added, all hope and enthusiasm right now.

“What? Me?” Vix blinked at the suggestion.

“Well, I know you get your allowance from the JOG, but wouldn’t you want more? We’ve got tons of free time after class every day. We could work together! Wouldn’t that be cool?” Vix frowned a bit and thought it over. She wasn’t opposed to working with Raiden, he was her friend after all. Though some small part of her wondered if being around the same person so much might actually harm their friendship… But getting a job wasn’t a terrible idea. Much as she hated to lean into any Jipasi stereotypes the thought of getting more credits made her tail twitch a bit.

“I guess… Does he really have that many boxes to be delivered?” She asked only for Raiden to shrug.

“No clue. But I mean… we can ask! Here, let me do the talking. I’ll help like… uhh…” Raiden paused and looked up for a moment, which made Vix arch a brow in confusion. “Hype!” Raiden snapped his fingers as he apparently remembered the word he wanted. “I’ll be your hype man.” He tugged on the straps of his backpack then and grinned at her as she couldn’t help but let out a snort.

“My hype man?” It wasn’t clear if he really had the right idea.

“Yeaaah!” Raiden insisted. “Hype you up, and make it clear he’d be a fool not to hire you. A fool!” Vix laughed at his enthusiasm and then shrugged.

“Can’t hurt I guess.” It wasn’t the worst idea by far, but she still wasn’t sure how he’d hype her up exactly. Delivering packages wasn’t a high skill job.

“Right. C’mon.” With that Raiden opened the door and they stepped inside. Whatever Vix had been expecting from how Raiden had earlier described the owner, and the place this really wasn’t it. She’d had a mental image of like… a quaint little store with things piled on shelves and slightly disorganized. But instead they were in the most fortified structure she’d ever been in. She’d never seen such a big stronglass screen before! The turrets in the ceiling immediately caught her attention and she froze in place as the guns moved to track her a moment.

Raiden however didn’t seem to think about it for more than a moment and just walked up. “Hey Mister Clay! I’m back and I dropped off everything like you asked!” A door in the back of the shop behind the stronglass opened and she saw the man step out. He was a bit older with greying hair, a work apron, and for some reason was wearing a fur coat with a giant very thick collar.

Except it wasn’t a fur coat. It took her a moment to realize what she was looking at before realizing it was a giant cat draped around his shoulders! When it looked up a bit at her she was just as startled to realize it was alive. “That’s very good Raiden. Who’s your friend?”

“This is Vix. Is that a cat! It’s huge!” Raiden stepped up closer to the glass to look at the cat lounging over the man’s shoulders.

“Yes, this is my Maine Coon Guster. Say hello Gus.” The man reached up to scratch the cat’s chin a moment as it nuzzled into the fingers.

“Meow.” Vix’s ears twitched as the cat… said that.

“Did he just say meow?” She asked, which made the pawn shop owner and Raiden look back at her.

“He did meow yes.” The man behind the glass acknowledged.

“Did he? I mean it was like he… It didn’t seem like he just… said it? Like not…” Vix twitched her ears again as they looked at her like she was speaking nonsense. But the cat’s golden eyes focused on her a moment and he taunted her once more.

“Meow.” She… really couldn’t put her finger on it but her mind was for some reason telling her he was somehow saying meow rather than just… meowing. Raiden was giving her a very confused look by now.

“Uh… never mind.” Vix shook her head and fanned her tail out a little as she stepped up towards the glass. “It’s nice to meet you Mister Clay.”

“Please, Clay is fine.” Clay waved it off and then shrugged his shoulders a moment, leaning to the side as his cat sort of… slid, sort of jumped off onto the counter. He began to stalk off to the side, weaving between the items on display for sale.

“Look Clay! Look what they gave me!” Raiden, ever enthusiastic right now actually lifted his leg up to thump his boot onto the countertop for Clay to see.

“Are those?” Clay grabbed a set of glasses hanging from a small leash dangling from his neck and put them on as he leaned in. “Absolute Dynamics jump boots. Remarkable. I had no idea my coupon would get you that footwear.”

“Well, they were especially nice cause I told them about Mister Marizi’s van across the street. Also, these are Absolute Dynamics?!” Raiden gasped as he looked at his own boot.

“Yes. They use a very novel inertia battery system combined with some very sophisticated flex coils to use the wearers own movement to charge up and improve jump height by an estimated five to fifteen percent. Not to mention selective hardening to decrease the likelihood of rolling your ankle by seventy five percent over the norm.” Vix blinked as the man just rattled off knowledge like that. “Though a lot of their claims are inflated and that actual results were rarely so good as they promised. Still, very nice boots.”

“Like… how nice? Are these worth like… thousands of credits?” Raiden asked and this now especially got Vix’s attention.

“Uh… That is a rather complicated question considering they’re technically illegal.” When Clay said that Raiden pulled his foot off the counter and looked worried. “Don’t fret!” Clay quickly added to calm Raiden down a bit. “Let me specify. They’re illegal for me to sell. Current Joint Occupation Government law states it’s illegal to sell any Absolute Dynamics mil-spec gear.”

“But they’re boots.” Raiden pointed out.

“Mil-spec is mil-spec. If you did find someone less inclined to follow the law then I would imagine they could be sold for a thousand credits considering they’re one of the smaller sizes.” Clay shrugged at the end.

“Wow… a thousand credits…” Raiden looked down at his boots. “Wait. That’s bad! Can I… trade them out?”

“Why is that bad?” Vix asked. “Raiden those are like… the nicest most expensive things you’ve ever owned. Why would you want to get rid of them?”

“What if my dad finds them! He’d sell them in a heartbeat! You think he’d let me keep these?!” Vix realized he was right, and she couldn’t help but feel bad watching her friend’s face fill with worry and fear.

“Your father would sell your boots?” Clay seemed puzzled by the very notion.

“He’s… not a nice guy.” Raiden answered, even though Vix wanted him to much more explicitly explain just how much of a piece of shit Dan was. But… it wasn’t her father, and it wasn’t her place to say. Still, she couldn’t help but feel her tail curl and flare in anger at the thought of his behavior.

“Oh… Well…” Clay scratched his chin a moment. “I could hold on to them for you. When you’re not working. If you still want the job delivering packages that is.”

“Yes!” Raiden nodded. “If… that’s okay with you.”

“It’s quite alright… But hmm… You’ll need footwear when you’re not here…” Vix watched Clay move away from the window and back along the rows of shelves he had for a little. Then he returned with a small cardboard box. “Here, take off your boots and try these.” Opening it up he revealed a set of what looked to be rather sturdy sandals with leather straps.

“What are they?” Raiden asked as he looked at his feet and then back up. “Uh… also… I don’t know how to take them off. They just told me how to make them tight.”

“Do the same thing. Pinch the tabs inside.” Clay instructed. Raiden reached down and did something with his boots and was able to pull them off easily. Setting them up on the counter he then pushed them into the little secure turntable built into the window, trading out the boots for the sandals. “Also these are Birch Sticks, which is just a knock off brand of sandal. Knock off in that they’re still great quality. Just not the name brand. You’d be shocked how much that decreases the value of otherwise well made items.”

Raiden set the sandals on the ground and stepped into them before working the straps a bit to get them tight. Vix frowned a bit though as he wiggled his toes inside the socks he was still wearing. “Should he be wearing socks with sandals?”

“That is actually a very good question, and a debate topic that goes back centuries.” Clay announced.

“Really?” Vix blinked.

“Centuries?” Raiden asked.

“Yes, it’s hotly contested. Many insist that socks and sandals should never be worn. Others say that it’s acceptable if you’re a man over the age of forty. While if you’ve ever been on any of the beaches on Nuova Firenze and seen the German tourists stomping around you’re only ever going to see feet clad in socks and sandals.” Raiden and Vix both looked at each other in a measure of confusion at his explanation.

“So… what… exactly does all that mean for me?” Raiden finally asked. 

“Are they comfortable?” Clay asked in return. Raiden nodded. “Then you’re fine unless you really care about fashion.”

“Weellll…” Vix muttered as she looked at his feet.

“What?” Raiden looked back, obviously interested in her opinion. “Do they look bad?”

“I… I dunno… I mean…” She gave a wave at herself and all her military surplus clothes. “I’m not one to talk honestly. But something just feels… wrong about socks and sandals to me. But like… not in a way that makes sense?” Her tail was fanning out as she tried to make sense of her own mind. But she noticed as she fanned her tail out that the cat behind the glass seemed much more interested in her. Those gold eyes focused on her colors which made her feel slightly nervous despite it just being a cat.

“Meow.” He announced, as if to further give her anxiety.

“Well… they’re comfortable so whatever. Hey uhm… also can I keep this backpack? A really nice Davari lady, the one I delivered to first… uhhh which was the one…” Raiden blinked a moment and pulled some paper from his pocket. “Misses Agnivra. With the heart medication. She gave me some food to take home.”

“Yes, you can keep the backpack.” Clay nodded. “Also that was nice of her.”

“Yeah! Real nice!” Raiden nodded emphatically.

“No problems with delivering the packages then?” Clay asked.

“Nope! Uh… Well… Some local… bullies chased me. But… They’re just jerks.” Raiden waved it off.

“Well, be sure to notify the local military police if they’re around. Don’t take threats of violence lightly.” Clay advised. “It’s getting a bit late, but I do have two more packages you might deliver if you want.”

“Oh. Yeah but uhm! What about my friend Vix here? She could use a job too. And she’s way smart. Smartest kid in our whole building! She aces all the class tests, and gets way high marks on all that stuff. Way smarter than me. She’d be an amazing employee!” Vix couldn’t help but furl her tail a bit as she was described like that. It felt so odd to hear someone heap compliments on her to another.

“So, I should fire you and hire her instead?” Clay asked as Raiden blinked.

“Uuhuhhh I mean I… uuuhhh.” But Clay just laughed and waved it off.

“Sorry, just a little joke. Though I’m not sure I really need two delivery… people.” Once more his hand moved up to scratch his chin as he seemed to consider her. She felt rather on the spot but she wasn’t sure what he was looking for. “I don’t mean to imply anything about you based solely on being a Jipasi, but how do you fare with haggling and negotiations?”

Vix set her muzzle at the question. There was the constant assumption about Jipasi and haggling… She really hated leaning into it… But she did just love to haggle with people. It was a contest of wills and smarts that gave her a rush more than she liked to admit. “I’m… competent at bargaining.” She finally admitted.

“She’s great! You should hear her go at people in [Haggletongue!] They never expect it when she just tears into them! She does all the bartering for the dorms!” Raiden just dove deeper into his self appointed job as her hypeman.

“Well… Then maybe I could hire you as a purchaser. See, at times I need to send someone out to get me something specific and it’s best if I don’t go myself. When people think it’s just some customer they have a very different attitude. Do you think you’d like to buy things on my behalf? Are you familiar with the old Jipasi customs? You’d essentially be my Quenmays Logriespi.” Vix froze up at the title. Either he didn’t know the true extent of that title, or he was seriously overselling the job. The Logriespi were infamous figures of legends, buying and selling with such devious intent that they were as much con artists as actual clan representative traders.

“That uh… I mean yeah I could.” Vix finally replied with a light shrug.

“You could? Well, are you sure you want the job? Don’t sound all that interested.” Clay arched a brow as he examined her.

“She’s just shy! Well, not shy. Modest! She’s just very modest.” Raiden kept trying to play her up.

“What are you, her hypeman?” Clay suddenly asked which made Vix laugh for a moment.

“Yeah. I mean, why not?” Raiden defended his actions then. “I just think it would be awesome if you hired her.”

“Alright alright I relent.” Clay raised his hands a moment. “I’ll give you a shot. It’s come to my attention that an unusual record has surfaced in the music store over on Lumiyva street.”

“The small specialty one with that lounge? Or the bigger one by the Gruborama?” Vix asked.

“The small one. It’s a first print of the self titled release album vinyl Brass Bunnies. I want you to go buy it for me. I will give you thirty credits.” He held up the bills. “You get to keep whatever is left after the purchase. It shouldn’t cost any more than thirty credits.”

“You’re just giving her thirty credits after you were giving me grief about a little back pack and some packages?” Raiden asked with a huff.

“I also now have your boots, and you insist your friend is trustworthy, so if she steals the credits it’ll come out of your pay.” Clay immediately shot back.

“Well… that’s fine cause... She would never do that.” Raiden glanced over at Vix and she stared back at him as if to dare him to make any other claims. “Yeah. Never. Your credits are in safe hands!” Raiden nodded more fervently then to support his own claim.

“Do I need to know anything else about the record?” Vix asked then as she stepped up and Clay put the credits in the secure window for her to grab.

“That should be it. Brass Bunnies, first print, self titled release. Thirty credits is an absolute max value.” Clay insisted.

“If it’s only thirty credits why do you want it?” Vix asked thinking about it while she grabbed the credits.

“I think that the value will rise shortly, plus I own the rest of the Brass Bunnies catalog and I think getting a full collection of first prints will make for a good package deal. That and it’s a fine test of your abilities. Enough credits that you have wiggle room, not so many that Raiden here can’t pay me back.” Clay nodded.

“I’m telling you she won’t lose them!” Raiden gasped out. Clay just chuckled and shrugged.

“I believe you. However, if I’m going to hire you on full time what’s your full name anyway? I should start getting paperwork written up for you two.” He pulled a tablet out of his apron then, apparently ready to type out her name.

“My full name? You know Jipasi names are… extensive right?” She checked and Clay just nodded. She took a breath for a moment and then began. “Vixosi Qitrin Rasvila Diranlirev Silverhawk Yuin Executive Kirkren Mossy Buvire Chichnik Pechikit Dwei.” Then she took a moment to play back in her head all the names to make sure she hadn’t missed any.

To her shock though Clay just looked at her and asked. “Any relation to the famous Jazz musician Rixrisi Qitrin?”

“Yes! He was my munstikara. Ah… my dad’s dad.” She explained quickly.

“Very good trumpet player. I got to see him live once years ago. Spectacular performance. Very cool. Do you play any instruments?” The fact that anyone would just casually know her munstikara was surprising enough. But that her possible new boss might know him was almost too much.

“Ah. No. My brother plays the trumpet. But… he is missing. My brother. I was just at the docks today, the ferry building looking for him.” She glanced around the shop a moment, eyes glancing over the various items he had behind the glass. Some looked very fancy. “I think he went to the heights for work. Do you do business up there?”

“With… If you mean do I purchase items from the heights in general? Yes.” He nodded.

“Do you think you could ask around maybe? See if they know of a Jipasi trumpet player?” Maybe the best chance for finding her brother was just a street off from her home rather than all the way down in the port.

“I… can ask around. How long has he been missing? If it’s just been a gig or something I’m sure he’ll show up. If not you should probably file a-” He started but Vix waved him off.

“He’s been gone four years. I’ve already reported it, but never heard anything back. Which just means his ID has never been flagged. I’m just trying to find where he went. I know he wouldn’t just… leave. And he can’t be dead or it would be in the system. I check.” She insisted. Behind the glass Clay shifted a moment and rubbed at his chin.

“I am… not a private detective. I just run a pawn shop. I can ask around but… no promises. Though… A Jipasi trumpet player shouldn’t be too common so maybe I’ll have luck. But you better work hard for me if I’m doing this free.” Vix just grinned as he answered like that. Nothing good comes free after all.

“Deal.” She nodded. “Okay, one album coming up! I’ll be quick so you can get to work!” She promised.

“No rush.” Clay waved it off and looked at Raiden. “So what’s your full name anyway?”

“Raiden Noonan.” He replied just as Vix went to leave.

“Noonan? Noonan. What’s the theming there? I don’t get it.” Vix slowed down a bit as Clay and Raiden spoke, a little curious about where this was going.

“Theming? I… there’s no… It’s just my name.” Raiden replied.

“Yes, but Raiden is an ancient Japanese god of thunder and lightning. Then… Noonan. What even is that? Some sort of… Celtic? Gaelic?” Clay asked as Raiden looked totally lost.

“Wh- I don’t know! It’s just my name! I didn’t pick it!” He insisted. Vix snickered a little as she finally opened the door to leave them to argue about Raiden’s name. There was a bit more of a spring in her step as she began to walk up the street. Something about Clay set her at ease… though his cat did creep her out a bit. Maybe she just didn’t interact with cats as much but she swore that thing didn’t quite sound right… Just thinking about it made her ears twitch and her tail curl a bit.

Then she looked at the credits in her hand and quickly tucked them into a pocket. Thirty credits was a nice bit of currency. She really could have gotten a lot of cinnamon rolls at the Ferry Building with this. Glancing back and forth up the street she quickly crossed, even though there was almost never any traffic. One could never be too careful though. Especially with how fast some of the military police drove around here. She wondered how many people got run over in the Ravex district if they all drove as fast as that military bike thing earlier.

Walking up the street she wondered at just how wildly different her day had gone from what she’d expected. If she could pull off getting this album cheap then maybe she’d have a job with a guy who could possibly track down her brother. She knew the man had said he couldn’t make any promises and that he was just a pawn shop owner but the Jipasi knew a thing or five about haggling shops like that. One didn’t get such an eclectic source of merchandise without knowing people. And the best way to know people is know people who know people. That way the knowledge extends out exponentially creating an interwoven net of social possibilities until someone somewhere in the net has what you want.

Besides, his pawn shop had military turrets on it! There was no way a simple pawn shop owner could get those. He had to have connections. And connections either meant the Heights, or the military. Or both. Thinking about the military she glanced up at the partially burnt Cultural exchange building just as she walked along the corner of it. 

Why would terrorists want to blow it up? It was already half destroyed anyway. She’d checked it out a few times with Raiden to look at the art that had been left behind. Sometimes she wondered why no one had stolen it yet, but then realized partially burnt community art likely didn’t have a high value with anyone. Not to mention kids didn’t weigh so much and could walk across the half rotten beams inside much easier.

When she rounded the corner to walk up Lumiyva street she noticed the American’s jeep wasn’t actually in front of the building. It was further down instead, parked in front of the old Dye Bank. Had they got the wrong building? She rolled her eyes a moment and shook her head as she crossed over the street once more and headed towards the music shop. It wasn’t a place she went to often. She’d never had a good experience with their employees. Not as bad as some places, they didn’t hate her for not being Davari, or try to convert her to Swagin or anything. They were that special brand of annoying hobbyist who felt that anyone who wasn’t the exact kind of same hobbyist then they just weren’t worthy of… anything possibly.

The storefront was full of posters, plastered on so thick she wondered if the front of the building was nothing but load bearing posters. Some were for local bands, some were from bigger concerts of traveling acts. The war hadn’t stopped the music scene in the city. It just… made it a bit trickier at times. In the occupation the biggest issue was crossing between zones to try and see a band so almost everyone came here to the joint occupation zone. Plus with the disconnect from the greater galactic extranet the hobbyists who had insisted on more physical types of musical media reigned supreme. It was a good time for music shops.

Still, she glanced up at the shop a moment and tried to think about how to get the record. Haggling was a delicate and refined process. Something so simple as how one entered the store could very easily affect the final buying price. If she could knock off several credits she wouldn’t mind taking ten back with her for her pay. Did she go for casual and disaffected? No no… She needed a specific item. It wouldn’t mesh if she tried to look nonchalant and then had a very specific item to call out. Her tail began to curl and twitch as she thought it over and rubbed her chin.

Just barge in straight forward and look rushed? No… Any indication of haste would drive up the price. Did she just play it straight? Walk right in and ask openly? It was a bold tactic. It might lead them to believe she had no intention of haggling and keep them off guard once she dug in. But it also might be too aggressive. What did she know about the band? Nothing. Why hadn’t she asked Clay? The idea he might help find her brother kind of got her out of there fast. Did she go back and get more info? No she’d look like a very poor Logriespi.

Aaahhh… which gave her an idea. She nodded slowly and her tail unfurled as the idea fit. It was a classic technique. Gift buyer! Yes. Set on her course of action she finally walked forward, and opened the door. She heard the jingle of a little bell hitting the top of the doo, and then something hit her in turn. The stench of a hobbyist music shop, ripe with old records, human cigarette smoke, Davari incense, and a myriad of other pungent scents. She had to snort hard to try and get the smell out of her nose and take a last gasp of fresh air before walking further inside.

The interior was mostly red. Red carpet, red felt lined record tables, and red curtains over the windows which were already blocked by posters outside. It was as if the mere hint of regular sunlight might upset the denizens of this place. A few instruments hung from the walls, but the focus was on the music. All forms of physical media from each species were present. Vinyls were the most common since all species had figured out some basic method of imprinting sound like that. Next most common were the thumbdrives since in the end digital media had been universal.

Though they did have other more specific things. She saw a few spools of Davari tunetape. Plus one of those outrageous large Ravex soundboxes. Most unusual was the Kra’Kto’Sui ocean tumblers. She didn’t see any Jipasi screamcases which made her tail twitch a little. But she was interested to see a display of some kind of human device. It was a small plastic thing with what looked to be a miniaturized version of the Davari tunetape inside. “[Can I help you cazzie?]”

Vix was rolling her eyes even before she looked over at the Davari behind the main counter. He was wearing a cheap looking shirt with some band name on the front she didn’t know. The Flickers. He was also wearing an outrageous number of armbands for some reason. “[Yeah, I’m looking for a gift.]” She replied as she headed towards him, brushing a hand along the tops of some records as she walked by to look like she had no idea what she was doing.

“[Please don’t caress the music like that. It can bend the covers cazzie.]” He grumbled a bit as she approached.

“[Oh? It does? Sorry.]” She feigned innocence and pulled her hand away. “[I just like how it feels. Something about that… old paper feel you know?]” She smiled and unfurled her tail a little as she looked back at him. “[Anyway, I have a friend who really likes an older band. The] Brass Bunnies. [Do you know them?]”

“[Yeah. Local band from back in the day. Pretty good for the time. Real musicians too. Not posers or cazzies. Which, if your decktongue isn’t very good stands for casuals by the way.]” While the employee crossed his arms in front of his chest Vix had to use all of her considerable willpower to not roll her eyes again.

“[I’m familiar with the term.]” She smiled and laughed as if it was a joke even though she knew he was trying to put her down. She wasn’t having any of that though. Focus on the haggle! “[Still, I’m trying to find something special for her. She really likes them so… got any of their albums?]”

“[Yeah we got a few.]” The Davari guy shrugged. “[If you’re looking for something special though we actually have a first print. That means it’s the first time an album was produced. Only for real fans. No cazzies.]”

“[Oh really? Is it a good album of theirs? Can I see it? That might be a good gift if it’s in my budget.]” Show interest but signal restricted purchase options. She knew how to haggle.

“[Uh yeah it’s their release title. Totally fwey. Right here.]” He turned around then and reached up to pull an album off the shelf from behind the counter. It wasn’t in a display case which was a good sign for her. Likely meant it was just valuable enough to keep separate from the main floor. He turned around to show off the album cover then which seemed to have some kind of little animal on it playing a trumpet. A bunny. Right, the human animal! But then when he turned it around she saw the picture on the back displayed an all female Davari band. Interesting.

“[Fwey fwey.]” She started to reach out but the employee just pulled it back.

“[Not fwey cazzie. We don’t sell first releases to anyone but hardcore fans. And you obviously don’t know the] Brass Bunnies [so just tuck tail and skitter rainbow rat.]” Her tail immediately unfurled in anger as he called that. Not to mention he was refusing to sell her something based on the most stupid abitrary reasoning ever!

“[How dare you! I’m no cazzie! Music is in my blood! And besides what kind of idiot-]” She started but then heard the bell at the door behind her.

“Hey Vix! I thought I- wooo fuck does this place stink!” Vix turned back in surprise and saw the American marines from earlier walking in. Specialist Taylor was up front waving a hand in front of his face. “Jesus! This place reeks of cigarettes, pot, and sweat stank! Oh it’s a music shop. Yeah that makes sense.”

“Did you guys need something? Shouldn’t you be focused on your mission?” She asked.

“We’re trying to find the right building.” Ramirez explained.

“Yeah! See, when you said it would be obvious it turned out to not be obvious! The biggest fanciest building is some kind of color vault thing.” Tim shrugged as they walked in.

“I didn’t think you needed me to literally point out the building!” She scoffed. “Are you telling me they sent you two to defuse a possible bomb in a building not only without a map on how to get there, but no picture of the building? Nothing?”

“We’re marines ma’am. We make due.” Ramirez answered with a shrug of his own.

“Yeah we make fucking due…” Tim muttered as he looked around. “Shit there’s a lot of weird stuff in here. What are those plastic things? Oh wait shit those are human aren’t they? I feel like I should have known that…”

“Well, the Dye Bank you guys parked in front of used to be a depository for various pigments and colors used in local art. Some artists had particular colors on file in their vault. But, it’s not the cultural exchange building.” Vix explained. “You want one over, the burnt one.”

“What? That was it? Who the fuck wants to bomb an abandoned building?” Tim snorted and then paused as he reached over to grab a particular album from the shelves. “Oh! Is this one of those covers that has one of this trick image things? I think I know this one. Ray’s Band from the shirtless rock era.If you shine it in the light and look at an angle you can see a secret image.” He began to flex the cover a bit as he tried to move it around in the light of the store looking for some kind of hidden image.

“[Hey. Hey! Are you military? Are you with them?]” Vix glanced back at the store employee who was now looking worried. “[Yeah I mean you’re Jipasi so… pox. I uh… look I didn’t mean that rainbow rat thing. I’m sorry!]” He was starting to look panicked, and his eyes glanced at the door in the back which headed to the store’s music lounge. Vix quickly thought over her course of action. He obviously didn’t know English.

“[We were on patrol in the area keeping you civvies safe. I just thought I’d do a bit of shopping. But you made it clear I’m just a rainbow rat. My boss here was wondering what was going on. While my buddy here is trying to decide how much merchandise you might want to lose for being insensitive to diversity.]” She crossed her arms and nodded at Tim.

“Whoa. Vix you gotta slow way down. I understood like… two of those words.” Tim protested, not realizing what was going on as he stopped bending the record and looked her way.

“[Hey, no! We’re cool! I was just… Listen. I was just… razhazing you! Big mistake! See I could tell when you came in here you’re a real deepdecker! Music in your blood like you said! No blooddebt! I just. You want the record? Here. Free.]” He began to hand it over but she raised a hand.

“[Do you think I’ll accept a bribe?! Are you trying to bribe me?!]” Her tail was fully unfurled in her clear indication of anger.

“Was that something about a bribe? Are we being bribed? I’ll take a bribe.” Tim offered as he looked around.

“[I’ll buy it. For one credit.]” She peeled off a five from her pocket to slap on the counter.

“[Sure! Sure!]” The employee nodded quickly and grabbed the bill to give her change and hand over the record.

“[I need a receipt.]” She said as she took the change and the album.

“[Right! Got it!]” The employee frantically rang her up and then tore off the paper to hand her the receipt. “[Listen just... I don’t want trouble! We’re cool with military! Just… if they want to check the lounge can I have like… ten minutes to uh… clean it up to their standards?]” He was starting to sweat a bit.

“[We’ll be fine.]” Vix nodded and turned, waving Tim and Ramirez back out. “Leave the album Tim. I just got a really good deal on a record since he was worried you two were here to bust him. And he’s an asshole who said some very unkind things about me so I wanted to abuse your presence.”

“Oh. Well fuck him.” Tim pointed at the Davari and then threw the album he had picked up onto the floor. “Watch your ass next time!” He added for good measure. “Wait, sarge if he’s worried about the lounge maybe we can get a real bribe for us too?”

“Shut up specialist.” Ramirez growled as he carefully maneuvered Tim through the door. Once they were outside Ramierz looked back at Vix. “What did he say to you?”

“He was refusing to sell me the record because I wasn’t a real fan in his eyes. Also he called me a… rainbow rat. Among other things.” She explained with a shrug.

“What a little exclusionary hipster asshole.” Tim snorted. “And you just wanted to get that record cheap? I’ve got some demo kits in the jeep. We can totally fuck him up you know.”

“No. We can’t. Though I agree he does sound like a hipster asshole.” Ramirez nodded. “Now then, the Cultural Exchange building please.”

“That one.” Vix pointed back up the street.

“Wha- the fucking blown out building?! Why the shit… Why would some stupid fucking religious extremists blow up a building that’s already blown up?! Why the fuck are we here? Sarge why the fuck are we here?!” Tim gasped out.

“We had reasonable intel reports.” Ramirez sighed. “We have to give it a sweep. Is it safe inside?”

“The ground floor is. The basement too I think? But it was locked up. The upper levels? Eehhh.” Vix shrugged.

“Alright… Maybe it’s bullshit maybe it’s not. We still have to check it out. Thanks again Vix.” Ramirez thanked her and looked both ways before he began to cross the street. Didn’t matter how old one got, looking both ways was always important.

“Yeah. You let me know if that guy gives you shit again. I will totally fuck him up for a low price. Like two three joints.” Tim offered and waved as he followed his sergeant. Vix just smirked and nodded.

“I’ll keep that in mind!” With that she began to walk back up the street, clutching the record to her chest. Today was actually going great! She had 29 credits! A new job! A possible lead on her brother! It was really going her way! It sucked she couldn’t get a cinnamon roll but with all this money she could go back and get some. Maybe even bring Raiden somehow to thank him for getting her the job.

As she got up to the corner she could see the marines were just getting the main door open. She gave them another wave which they returned before heading inside. It was a nice day out, so a few more people were out and about than normal. Just down the street she noticed the local bullies Nef and Lenk. They were moving pretty quickly away from her but she still didn’t feel like taking the risk so she began to move across the street towards the parkside. Just in case. Never could be too-

An incredible wind knocked her flat to the street, asphalt rushing up to smash against her muzzle and hands as she tried to catch herself. Her ears were flat against her head as she just lay there a moment, tail unfurled and laid across her body as if to shield herself from an attacker as she felt it flutter hard in the intense rush of air. She couldn’t breathe. She had no breath. She didn’t know what to do. Open her mouth. Open it. Breathe! Gasping out hard she felt air rush back into her lungs and coughed hard as her body tried to process whatever had just happened.

33,lrwwjt,HFY,Thu Feb 25 05:21:48 2021,(Ch.1) A Cat That Really Was Gone- An SSBverse story,"Hey guys! I've done writing before and won some competitions, but never really posted anything. Im not on reddit a lot but I will be writing this story. If you wanna talk to me im on the SSB discord.

This is the Sexy Space Babes Universe. Basically, Tech advance purple space orc amazons come take over Earth because they have a manifest destiny thing going on. Most of the universe is 7 to 1 females and the guys are usually kinda losers. So they find a planet that they consider full of sexy space babes.

Also I did get permission from u/bluefishcake so suck it

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**A Cat That Really Was Gone Ch.1**

A lone shadow crossed the large tiles of the floor, illuminated by moonlight. The stars reflected from the glassy surfaces of the interior, revealing the craftsmanship inside. Expansive decoration and lovely glass textures entwined with the placements of a few benches or potted plants. Artistry and carvings lined the long walkways of the halls, no expense spared for the grandest building in Russia. The Kremlin was the mighty capital, standing for decades as a sign of Russian defiance to any who opposed them. The colorful domes of bright colors stood atop pillars of masterful architecture. Near these ornaments is a large rectangular building covered in windows and arches, where the fortified compound sat behind the walls of the capital. Gold accents, white bricks, and green highlights danced along the strong fortifications, a bold color scheme that flourished until it clashed with a foreign hue. Enormous purple banners swayed only just in the crisp night air. The massive unfurled flags draped across the many windows of the Kremlin sported a slash and two dots, accompanied by many more hung from the turrets and once proud Russian stars.

The figure that walked through the halls listened to her own echoing footsteps. Her pace was steady, with classic sounds of stiletto hitting tile resounding through empty passageways. She peeked, just for a second, out of the glass pane leaking silver beams. It only served to worsen her mood. Aliens, purple amazons, had conquered the heart of the country. It had been years since the occupying force of the Shil’vati had successfully invaded Earth. Governments fell fast; the Kremlin itself was their first target in Russia. The halls were once filled with bustling attendants and government workers, but the Shil’vati has mostly eliminated the need for them. They promised that nothing had changed, and that they were there to simply supervise, but she knew the truth. The government was a puppet now, nothing more. The aliens did most of the work, they just needed to shut up, sit down, and look pretty. She grimaced at that. Every now and then some Countess or whatever the hell they were would come and ask questions, or simply need something done with human resources. Usually this would entail investigating rebels or divulging information to the Shil’vati Interior. She never knew what really happened after that, she was mostly kept in the dark. Just like always.

Finally, she stopped. She turned and faced the maple door, glossed so she could see her reflection quite clearly. Deep wrinkles creased and her sullen eyes that had lost their youth stared back. She pushed away the few grey strands of hair that dangled across her antique glasses that strapped around her head with a string. She straightened her back and her coat, cleared her throat, adjusted her glasses one last time, and bravely opened the door with a clipboard in hand. Inside, she found the one that had requested her presence at such a late hour. A Shil, and a high ranking one at that, if the markings were anything to go by. The tall purple woman had an imposing silhouette, with moonlight flanking her broad shoulders and tied up hair. Hands uncrossed, her face sullen and serious. The imposing woman gestured to the chair in front of the desk she sat in.

“Dr. Khristina. Please, sit: we have much to discuss.”

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**\*WAAAAAAAAAGH\***

The alarm. Emergency.

**\*WAAAAAAAAAGH\***

Something is wrong. Alarm is active.

**\*WAAAAAAAAAGH\***

Blood pumped harder and faster into the augmented brain.

**\*WAAAAAAAAAGH\***

Alarm detected. Intruder?

**\*WAAAAAAAAAGH\***

Unlikely. Stop alarm, assess situation.

Dust that covered every crevice began to rustle, and blew ever so slightly from the disturbance in the void. A tinge of blue began to pervade through the dark, slowly revealing the abyss to be a tiled room. The aura grew more, reaching a peak that filled the area with a ghostly aqua.

Eyelids covered in frost and ice began to shake. Slowly and steadily, they opened to their surroundings. Mist danced through dark surroundings that became clearer as senses began to awaken in the body. The first thing the nerves felt was cold. Blistering cold. The type of cold that would freeze a person in seconds, as was intended.

\-Assuming last recollection true; acting accordingly to standard procedure.-

With this, the figure strained their muscles to break free from the chilled container. Decades of stasis had rendered them confused and unresponsive. Trying once more to budge, the ice held steadfast.

It would wait for the flesh to once again cooperate.

The cold was a nuisance, but nothing it had not faced before. The Far North had been crueler. Its hand twitched. Accelerated and controlled bloodflow did the trick to get the extremities to cooperate once more with the demands of the brain. The shaking arm bended at the elbow to reach forward, stopping when fingertips collided with a frosted barrier. It paused: the brain worked overtime, thawing off the mental ice lost in slumber. The figure remembered now: prototype cryostasis. Deactivation would only occur before the set date if secondary energy source ran dry. If excluding outside variables, the battery lasted for around thirty years or more. Maybe less. It did not care at the moment. The cover had not released the subject yet, and it had grown impatient. It needed to function.

\-Primary objective: locate cause of outage. Control center priority,-

Blood ran faster now to awaken the mass of bone and muscle. Toes and fingers twitched before curling repeatedly. The figure shifted slightly more. Eyelids blinked faster, breathing and heart rate exploded. With a final push of newfound effort, the clear covering above the metal casket launched before cracking against some unseen object in the dark. Moments passed while the abrupt noises abated through the dark, the figure shifting once more. Feint wisps of fog floated from the edges of the object it was entombed within. Deep gasps became controlled; calm. The practiced breathing it should always have and maintain.

Willing itself up, abdominal muscles wailed in protest from their sudden load. Two muscular arms rocketed to the freezing sides of the tube, aiding the struggling core. Sitting there for what had seemed like an eternity, another deep breath accompanied the swinging motion of legs. It was with great effort it overcame the curving lip along the sides of the chamber and planted its soles on the tiles below. Inhuman pupils dilated, struggling to adapt to the change of scenery. The mind connected and refreshed with the nervous systems, modified electric pulses flowing to each handcrafted fiber. Legs became less and less shaky as more weight pressed upon them. With a final grunt, the full form was illuminated by the dying cryopod. Veins riddled the form of the large, nude, and very male figure. Muscle packed on from experience and repetitive training strained and flexed, finally working again from a long break.

He stood and began reactivation of his sore muscularity. Straightening his arms, he felt the triceps pump and strain with his shoulders. Curling both arms, ballooning the biceps. He stretched downwards, activating his back muscles. He bent back up, leaning back to mobilize the spine. The scar tissue stretched across his abdomen as he clenched his lats and deltoids, which fared no better in terms of the marred texture. The light barely did the damage justice. Healed holes scattered his torso, with jagged slashes through his arms and legs. Curious tattoos adorned the more surgical scars, the straight cuts that one had to see up close to notice. A number and a symbol, varying from Cyrillic characters to more direct symbolism. A knife here, a corrosive emblem there. His neck held a large and rough gash, a tattoo above it logged the damage with more symbols. The clearest part of him was his head; shaved down to a buzzcut that fit his chiseled face. A vertical slice, clean and healed, with an Alpha marking bordering the line that traced the incision was the only noticeable scar amongst the top of his head. If he was clothed, he might have even passed as normal if viewed from the back. Discarding the irregular mass and size, that is. He held his limbs in front to examine if any new damage not logged had appeared. No new tattoos, either. The solid white eyes methodically addressed his physical well being. Barely visible pupils methodically ensured every detail. Nothing would slip past. He wouldn’t make that mistake again. The alarm didn't sound off again, as it had when the pod began shutdown. Perhaps it was a warning of the waning power.

So far, he had seen no imminent threat and needed to be in prime condition should the situation call for it. With his own checklist completed, he took in his current setting. Exactly as he remembered it, give or take an inch of dust and lack of fixture lighting. The blue light died down to barely noticeable, leaving him alone again in the dark. Not that it affected him at all. His eyes were made to see in extremely low light situations. They could adapt quickly, to low and high light situations as they arose. The quickly fading cryo lighting gave him just enough to see what he remembered as the prototyping room, brief as his visits had been. Computers once displaying wealths of data stood silent, a row on each side of the room. A metal door, reminiscent of submarine hatches, stood at the end of the pseudo-hallway formed by the monitors. And so he set off. Shaky steps reminded him of his recovering state, so he slowed down just a tad to get used to the sensation of motion. His feet slapped against the tile. The mind made connections again, once again adapting to the habits of movement. The steps grew steadier. By the time the wheel for the hatch was in grasp, his body was back into the steady state it had been machined to be in.

Two rough hands grasped and yanked the wheel into motion, years of grime and neglect standing no chance to the raw force of the action. The door stubbornly resisted the breaking of the seal, its cries bounding into the pitch black passageways beyond the gate before yielding. No light remained now, just sheer emptiness and absolute silence. He broke it with the pads of his feet impacting upon the now metal floor. Unfortunately, his eyes were like night vision, and night vision is an enhancer of thermal reflections. With no light to begin with, he was effectively blind as a bat. So he did what bats did, and used sound. Each footstep painted a temporary picture as the waves bounced around to and fro. His modified intellect worked harder, generating a mental formation of the area. He knew where he was now in relation to the control center. Past his room, left on the corridor between the armory and bunks. A long and steady trek began down the lonesome military halls.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“General Bozenia.”

The older woman nodded in greeting to the Shil’vati. Her shaking hands grasped the firm and slick oak chair, sliding into the fabric cushion and crossing her legs to at least try and give an air of confidence.

“Ooh, thats MISS General Bozenia to you!”

The sinister figure suddenly broke her facade, her tusks splaying wide as she smiled.

“We’ve known each other for, what, three years now? No need to be so damn professional,” the general grinned even wider as she made light of her friend.

“I just needed you to clarify some things for me that I mentioned over the phone.” She gestured to an odd looking box that looked to be confused on whether it was a flip phone or a smartphone.

“Gotta say Lada, you humans may still be throwing rocks at each other, but you definitely have some good ideas. Like the taxi. That’s a good one too. Ooh, or th-”

“Bozenia, with all due respect, I too cherish our relationship. However, it is quite late and if a social call was the reason I was alerted, I wish to take my leave.”

Dr. Khatrina avoided eye contact, fiddling with the pen attached to her clipboard. Her hands couldn’t stop shaking, and she clutched the pen and clipboard for dear life.

Bozenia crooked her head as she squinted towards one of her best friends. This wasn’t like her. Though she stood at a meager five feet and six inches, Lada was a woman that gave off the aura of a Matriarch. She first met Lada during the integration of governments, which she admits was more of a benign takeover. They had been moving her out of her designated office and needed help with the heavier items in the room. What surprised Bozenia was how she took it all in stride, cracking jokes that “she’d just got the window office too.” Bozenia had been in charge of the invasion force for this continent, which apparently meant she was responsible for handling it afterwards too. So, she tried her best with patrols and peacekeeping. It didn’t work well. Potshots came from buildings and though the rounds were shrugged off easily enough, dozens of them started to hurt. You could start to tell who had patrol next from the amount of bruises they had. Shambling machines that barely passed as cars tried to careen into patrols. Several marines even tensed up still when they heard hard bass music or the smell of vodka. Bozenia had been going crazy: she had never had to take care of a populace before, and it was a nightmare. Until Lada helped.

Bozenia hadn’t even really asked full on for help, just insight into the locals and perspective they had. Might as well try to relate or appease to them to decrease the amount of bruising pads they were burning through. Lada was supposedly some social expert and scientist for this old ‘KGB’ organization, so Bozenia figured it was worth a shot. Lada shot up for the chance to get involved again, which Bozenia had not expected at all. Most of the humans either wanted to gut her or tell them what to do, not actively work with her. Lada became her best help, far better than her good intentioned Captain Ada. Though it was rough at first, Lada’s “culture festivals” hosted for free around town slowly attracted more and more with the promise of refreshments.

And so, after a few short months, things were back to peaceful. At least, for the Russians. The Shil’vati would never get used to the music or culture. They stopped trying to confiscate firearms and illicit substances, and broadcasted as such. The local marines started showing off their own versions of refreshments, and tried the local stuff too. Which Bozenia had to put a limit on. The marines had brought fruity and tasteful alcohol that would put a swing to your hips and a smile on your face with a couple drinks. The locals had also brought out their favorite, vodka, which she dubbed “Sea of Souls water.” Just one bottle could put you on your ass for a couple days. Some of the marines had even tried smoking, the humans called it, and laughed heartily when the girls almost passed out from coughing. Resistance was still there, but it was absolutely not as bad as it could be. Or as bad as it had been. Bozenia had one person to thank for that, and it was Lada Khristina.

“Well, I just thought I’d catch up with you, I, uh…” she licked her lips and looked away to think. “I wanted to talk to you more about your history. Y’know, that whole KGB, soviet stuff.”

Dr. Kristina peered at her comrade above her classes, head still bent down.

“In the middle of the night? I’m sure this could have waited.”

Why was Lada being such a hardass? Sounded like Captain Ada right now.

“Yeah, yeah, well it is more about the specifics of what you guys did? See, the Interior, bunch of bastards they are, want to kinda of get the gist of what humans did in the past regarding tech. They might think of you as primates, but with the recent ingenuity the rebels have been cooking up, they want to know what to expect.”

Lada looked down, staring holes into her clipboard. “And what does that require of me?”

Bozenia thoughtfully scratched her purple cheek, tapping her tusk as she spoke.

“Weeelllll…. They’ve kinda been on my ass about this one. Apparently they dug into the western continents, and found some weird stuff about this freezing conflict you guys had a bit back. Humans were trying some crazy things, and for the first time they met resistance while prying. Guys would just clamp shut when asked about the projects. Best sources were some online congregations, which are hardle reputable. You know the Interior, they can’t stand not knowing everything going on. So they thought, ‘Fine, if you won’t tell me, I will find somebody that will’. And here we are.”

“Freezing conflict?” Lada furrowed her brow. “Oh, the Cold War. Yes, a conflict between the United States and Soviet Russia. No real fighting, at least that anyone will admit, but plenty of research and espionage.”

“No fighting? That’s an odd one,” Bozenia muttered.

“Well, I am sure skirmishes broke out. But for the most part, it was subtle and political means that it was waged with. Neither side wanted to start all out war with the other in the case both would be wiped out. So dirty tricks and secret projects won out.”

Bozenia nodded for a moment, then surmised that it must be like when two planetary governors had a feud. Never a direct attack, but they sure did know how to make the other suffer. Pirates would “incidentally'' know when to strike a royal convoy and kidnap an official or two, and ships carrying valuable cargo found themselves suddenly a lot lighter after a brief stop at stations. The Shil’vati ran a speed based warfare to be sure, but the long game of espionage was no stranger to the more entrenched figures in the system.

“These are all things that can be found on the data-net. Why did you need me?’ Lada had been able to calm her nerves somewhat. She hadn’t started to sweat too badly.

“Oh yeah, sorry, I said over the phone. When the Interior first started hitting dead ends, as you call it, they wanted to talk to me. And, with them being the Interior and all that, I gave ‘em access to everything we got when we first came here. Digital files and everything. And they found a bit of an issue. Humans started getting really into absurd weaponry, like brain alteration and all that. Shil’vati have a good understanding of mental illness and injuries, but to try and utilize it as a weapon seemed… unthinkable. To be honest, the Interior started to worry. With that new human who has an AI of all things, they are starting to pick up that humans may not be as dumb as they think. What worried them most of all was the gap in the Soviet records for a solid decade. In weapons design, personnel, everything. Like it had been wiped clean.”

Silence.

The room was quiet before Lada clicked her pen in nervousness.

“Yes, uhm, well, it was a time of strife. I am sure some agent or paranoid official simply wiped it clean to avoid lashback. The, uh, the wall fell and the Americans had won. It was likely and research could fall into their hands, and with so many people still working, perhaps it was determined to be better to erase everything.”

Bozenia leaned back and shrugged.

“Maybe. Seems weird they’d just dump it all, though. Even if it was weaponry, you’ve already lost. Only reason was if it was…” Her gold and black eyes slightly widened as she stared to the ceiling. “Morally questionable.”

Lada didn’t bother to stop her slow clicking of the pen.

Click, click, click.

“Again, Bozenia, while I would love to discuss historical theory with you, perha-”

Bozenia was the one to cut her off this time.

“I’m getting there, sorry,” she sheepishly said, “so the theory was that maybe, just maybe, there were some physical copies somewhere. We know you humans like that stuff, especially after the fuss you made when that poor marine handled your file case. And so I thought, my friend literally was part of the agency that did all that! So…” Her vascular forearms pressed on the table as she leaned across the desk. “Do you know of anything like that?’

Bozenia could’ve sworn that she saw time freeze, and suddenly the nervous wreck of Lada became Dr. Khristina again.

“I am sorry. I do not.”

Lada began to push back her chair, cursing at herself for losing her cool. She was Lada Khristina. She was a head scientist at the Operational Technical Directorate for the KGB. She broke anyone in her way. They didn’t break her. She huffed, assuring herself with newfound vigor. She had done this plenty of times. Deny everything. No American spy bested her, and no mole ever escaped. Shil’vati were no different. She was a vault, closed and locked.

Lada stood, and straightened her treasured lab coat once again.

“Well, I am sorry for troubling you.” Bozenia cringed, struggling to get to the heart of the confrontation. Lada reached for the door, but was interrupted once more.

“Before you leave, I did notice that you dropped a file in that old office of yours.”

She stopped, and turned to grab the file. It was pulled right out of her reach.

“I read through it, you know. At first it was gibberish, but a few of the intel people noticed some patterns in the top left. See this right here? Those three symbols. The long stick thing means weaponry, the second is a genetics coil, and that last one was tricky. It was placed on anything the KGB designated to be top priority, secrecy wise and impact wise.”

Lada, slowly sat back down, her calm demeanor still present.

“ I realize. I was a dutiful member.”

The purple woman seemed somber now. “Well, uh, Lada, here’s the thing. This file is one of a kind. No matching digital copies anywhere. That could be a coincidence. The only thing is that…” The tusked lady looked down, strands of hair draping over her head. “I showed the Interior. They wanted to be sure. I told them you got rid of all the files when you moved, either digitized them or lost them. Of course, they ignored me. Full background checks, asking everyone they know in your government about it. And I guess they found something, because they want me to bring you in.”

Lada was unfazed. “For what purpose?”

The Shil’vati put her forehead in her hand as she spoke.

“Listen Lada. The Shil’vati are different. Much different. Some things that are okay for you are not okay for us, and of course the other way around too. ‘Vice versa,’ I believe is what you said. They told me you were… well…a geneticist.”

So what? They knew her old profession. It didn’t matter.

“We Shil’vati are not really that fond of genetic tampering. Just a bit back some athlete got accused of it. We don’t take that lightly. Genetic tampering isn’t just some material booster or injection for an unfair advantage. If it was, perhaps she would have been left alone with a slap on the wrist and a small suspension. But…”

The purple woman swallowed, struggling to say her piece.

“It is changing who you are. It is disgraceful. Shil’vati are born in the form of the Empress. The team put themselves in danger to simply try and jump higher and run longer. We know about genetics, and we have our own gene experts. It is good for cures, finding the body’s responses to ailments and the like. But these are unthinkable acts of modification. The research requires too much sacrifice, and lives would be lost to try and simply progress the field. There are many better alternatives available.”

“I just researched DNA, RNA, human bodies. I am a scientist, General. I did no such things.”

Bozenia pursed her lips. She hated this.

“Lada.”

The greying woman, still collected, made eye contact with the golden iris.

“Normal geneticists don’t burn their life’s work in a barrel fire.”

Shit. She had seen that. How? She checked everywhere. Shil’vati had an easy sleeping schedule. They could barely stay up past dark before they passed out.

“It was when I was stressing about my girls being attacked. Couldn’t sleep.”

The general answered the unspoken query.

“At first I was sad. Thought some human genius had thrown away everything she had just cause some advanced chicks had come and blown it all out of the water. So I tried to save some when you left, try and cheer you up some. You had just offered me help, so I felt indebted.”

Oh God no. It couldn’t be. The one page she didn’t need coming back, ever. She would’ve been fine with a railgun blueprint, maybe even the infinite mass generator. It had to be the damn project. That goddamned place. She only even had that one sheet in her cabinet. It had no details, just the markings and a name.

“They think that the KGB was not just tampering with genes, but completely reforging the body. Playing as goddesses, if you will. This page that dropped from your files, it has the same markings the burnt file has. This one, however, has a name and a very official looking stamp. Both of them involve weapons, genetic tampering, and something the KGB designated as important.”

She slid a slick container over that contained a preserved, but badly burned paper. The title and symbols were barely legible. She knew what it said.

Sweat finally trickled down her nose. Her ears rang, like someone had just rang a gong next to her. She couldn’t focus. Her fierce persona was gone. She shook all over, a nervous habit from an age she loved to have forgotten.

The general dismounted her seat and came close to the shuddering woman. Bozenia squatted down, wanting to console the doctor she had come to trust. She had never seen her like this. The clipboard had fallen to the ground, and the pen was now in overdrive. Rapid clicking filled the room. Bozenia looked to her face, now covered in messy hair. She saw the human’s eyes completely locked onto the burnt paper. Bozenia herself hadn’t looked too hard at it, she had merely seen the symbols and made the connection from the burning. She traced Lada’s eyes to what exactly captivated the wreck in front of her. It was the human lettering. Bozenia learned from Lada that you had to know your enemy, so she picked up Russian. She still struggled with English, but she knew the writing well enough to know the title of the crisped document in front of her. She rubbed the back of the almost sobbing doctor with care, and leaned closer.

“Lada.”

The doctor’s face turned slow, twitching and glistening with sweat. Bozenia stared deep into her eyes, which seemed to glass over when she asked her final question.

“What is Project Rasputin?”
