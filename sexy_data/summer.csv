And each time I get an auto response telling me I'm so brave for reporting, and helping to keep the community safe or some shit and gives me some (American) helpline numbers to call if I'm ""in a crisis"".

Tinder, I met this guy on your app, he sexually assaulted me, can you please look into my case to get him removed from the app.

*Whilst humans and Heptarchs war in the depths of space, the imperial civil war continues apace as the forces of Shintarno and Vollanknor clash in open battle...*

&amp;#x200B;

The system had been an unstable trinary, filled with the remains of proto-planets torn apart by the gravitational tides of three hot stars and a large complement of gas giants. Given time, the system would likely have collapsed in on itself, but it would never get the chance now - thanks to the two figures seated opposite each other in a gold and silver tower, far from the raging cauldron that had once been a solar system.

&amp;#x200B;

James and Natalya had no idea how they knew what they knew - they just knew that they did - and so they'd set to work. Two dozen parsecs away, the trinary star system was being sucked into a vortex, pulled in towards a centre and ripped apart on the subatomic scale, then compressed and forced through a blue-rimmed hole in space. Near Avalon's star an orange-rimmed hole spun around the star in precise geometric shapes, spraying forth a dense torrent of sub-atomic fire that shifted and changed even as it poured out. Mere baryonic matter was too weak for the project they had in mind - prone to the ravages of entropy and the monstrous gravitational pull of a black hole, or the raw power of a supernova. The exotic structure they were building was stronger than any of that - a 120-cell, or hyper-dodecahedron - built of frictionless, crystallised space-time and the last word in reflectivity, the mass-energy of an entire star system woven into its structure in endlessly repeating patterns of bouncing photons that went from the Planck-scale and up to structures hundreds of miles in size. For hours the two humans continued to work, until at long last the structure was done. Built around Avalon's star, each of the long beams that formed the hyper-dodecahedron was thousands of miles in diameter, yet set against the star they were set around might as well have been invisible.

&amp;#x200B;

Matteo Bianchi was waiting outside the Songcasting Spire when they emerged. ""How'd it go? We safe from those rings now?""

&amp;#x200B;

Natalya nodded. ""We think so. The shape - the... whatever we end up calling it - should help keep the laws of physics working properly. We'll have to keep an eye on it though, because it can be overwhelmed. Should buy us some time though.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Excellent!"" Matteo clapped his hands and rubbed them together approvingly.

&amp;#x200B;

As the three of them walked down the corridor, the Italian couldn't help but chuckle.

&amp;#x200B;

""Something funny?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Ah, you could say that. It's you two - you've both been so quiet since, you know, the golden eyes and all that.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Ah. Yeah - it's actually been awkward with the children,"" James replied. ""We've had to make an effort to speak out loud when we're at home together, because otherwise I don't think we'd speak at all. It's just... I mean, there's no ambiguity or misunderstandings, it's instant, and... honestly, we've never been closer.""

&amp;#x200B;

""No ambiguity? In a *marriage*?!"" Matteo gave a mock shudder. ""I swear all those generations living in the cold must have done something to you northern European types. It's not natural."" James and Natalya burst out laughing, and Matteo glanced back to look at them. ""It wasn't that funny... oh. I get it. What did he say - or she say? Ah, porca miseria!""

&amp;#x200B;

Four hundred miles south-east of the Devon family's island home, half a dozen figures were seated around the Wrights' swimming pool, enjoying the hotter continental climate. Clad only in swimming trunks, a set of aviator sunglasses and a cowboy hat, and half a cigar protruding from his mouth, Tom Wright lay back on a lilo, blowing blue-grey smoke up into the air.

&amp;#x200B;

""So where are we going to hit next?""

&amp;#x200B;

Tom pulled out his cigar and flicked some of the ashes off, transmuting them into droplets of water before they hit the surface of the pool. ""I've picked out a dozen sectors all over the place - pretty random selection, so should be safe enough.""

&amp;#x200B;

Wolfgang von Bremen nodded. ""A dozen, sounds good. Means we don't leave this place undefended, and... is it two sectors per man, or are our wives joining in?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Depends on what they want to do,"" Tom replied. ""We need to keep recruiting if we can - nine families isn't enough, and I think I read once that a hundred and sixty individuals was the absolute minimum. Dunno if that was a fifty-fifty split or just a few lucky guys and a big old harem though. Me, I won't be satisfied until we've got a couple of hundred families here, minimum.""

&amp;#x200B;

""You still think they will try to attack Earth again?"" Heidi asked.

&amp;#x200B;

""I'd bet money on it if we had any."" Tom grunted. ""Just my luck that those commies who wrote Star Trek would be right after all.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Huh?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Well, we don't have any money out here - heck, what was that line Karl Marx wrote? 'From each according to his ability, to each according to his need'? Well, we're way beyond even that - it's like we've gone back to a barter economy. Ain't right.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Ah, it is nothing - it just took you Americans a while to accept that we Russians were right all along,"" Dmitry said - then yelped as his wife very deliberately poured her ice-cold drink over him. ""Katya!""

&amp;#x200B;

""Da?"" Ekaterina asked innocently.

&amp;#x200B;

Tom stuck an arm up and made the ""ok"" sign in her direction, a smug grin on his face. ""Say Wolfgang, did James ever show you his voting trick?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Voting trick?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Here."" Tom stuck his free hand into the pool and pulled out a dry copy of the US Constitution, then tossed it towards the German couple. It floated over. ""Just read the preamble.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Okay... 'we the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union...' I don't get it,"" Wolfgang said, looking up.

&amp;#x200B;

""Read it again.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Uh... wait, it's changed! 'We the people of Greater Texas, in order to kick ass and'..."" he trailed off. ""I guess we can't even have a proper government out here, if our documents are changing like this.""

&amp;#x200B;

""I know - ain't it great? I figure we'll be running things like our ancestors did back in Roman times - just get everyone together and have a big old meeting. What did James call it - a moot, or a thing.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Or a what?""

&amp;#x200B;

""No, a thing - that's what it was called. I think he said the Danes still call their government that. Anyway, we're getting way off base here - point is, I've picked out enough targets that the ladies here can join in if they want, and if they don't then we men can handle it.""

&amp;#x200B;

""And is it working?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Sure seems to be. Hiroaki built a ton of those big Japanese cartoon robots, and has been sending them out as scouts seeing as how nobody's sent any ships for them to fight. So far, every time we've hit an Archmagos we've turned their sector into an instant warzone.""

&amp;#x200B;

""'I against my brother. I and my brother against my cousin. I, my brother, and my cousin against the world'. A Turkish gastarbeiter I knew told me that.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Yeah, well I think the imperials would've figured him for a bleeding heart liberal,"" Tom replied. ""It's all against all for these sonsofbitches - pardon my French - and the only thing keeping a lid on the whole darned thing is the threat of superior force. Just wait until we find and nuke those Heptarchs.""

Cabbantir coiled himself tighter around the back of the chair and looked to his partner nervously, his free copy of today's *Inter-Species XXXcesses* for once unread on the table. \~I'm telling you, the guy's trouble. Like, trouble with a capital ""skip the re-education and go straight for the public executions"".\~

&amp;#x200B;

\~Not saying I disagree with you. Just saying he's making a whole lot of sense,\~ his Mollindar partner Hapnor replied. \~What, you prefer a millitoken an hour?\~

&amp;#x200B;

\~I prefer not getting hauled in front of a convicter and turned into a psych-slave for the Magos,\~ Cabbantir shot back, referring to the nearest equivalent to a judge in the imperial legal system. \~I wouldn't even be here if it weren't for my... situation.\~

&amp;#x200B;

Dukkarin almost paused in his telepathic speech as he picked up the side-bands from Cabbantir's last thought, but pressed on. He'd find a way to talk to the two psychic bouncer later - besides, he was nearly done. The audience was attentive and quiet - not the sort of thing that most public speakers might have wanted, but then Dukkarin wasn't exactly like most public speakers. It was easy to rile people up about something they already understood and accepted as a part of their lives, but it was something else to get them to consider something radically new. Besides, most of his audience weren't the usual mixed bag of dissatisfied workers - here, he was expounding to the leadership of a pre-existing group.

&amp;#x200B;

The speech came to an end at last, and Dukkarin stepped down from the crates he'd been using as an impromptu stand. \~Deja-coss, go ask those two to come over,\~ he thought, adding the ""flavour"" of Cabbantir's and Hapnor's mind to the message.

&amp;#x200B;

\~Sure thing,\~ the young thief replied.

&amp;#x200B;

A few moments later, and Dukkarin motioned for the two bouncers to sit. \~I overheard your conversation,\~ he began, \~and couldn't help but hear of your,\~ he indicated Cabbantir, \~situation. If you don't mind my asking, what happened? I've never heard of the surgery failing before now.\~

&amp;#x200B;

\~Who - no, *what* the hell are you?\~ Cabbantir hissed. \~No Vrak I've met is that sensitive, nor does anyone look like you in my mind-vision.\~

&amp;#x200B;

Dukkarin could feel the build-up of psychic energy for an attack. \~A week ago, I was on a Magos-world called Ultis II, near the Null Zone. I am a Vrak, but since I met the humans I mentioned earlier, I've been... different.\~ He turned to Hapnor and raised a hand in caution. \~Let him attack if he wants. It won't hurt.\~

&amp;#x200B;

Cabbantir's eyes widened and he stared warily between Hapnor and Dukkarin. \~To hell with th-\~

&amp;#x200B;

\~Stay.\~ Dukkarin's thought was polite and measured - yet irresistible. \~I'll let you go if you really want to go, but please reconsider.\~

&amp;#x200B;

Cabbantir loosed the mental bolt at Dukkarin, and physically winced as he saw it hit and transform into a dazzling burst of psychic light. He tried to move but still couldn't - and then felt Hapnor lay a slender arm on his side. Some of the people he'd been hired to guard were now looking in his direction too. Shit.

&amp;#x200B;

\~Dude, just tell him. Hell, tell *me* \- I never understood why you stuck with that Tavanti for so long either!\~

&amp;#x200B;

\~Because... because I had a child with her, okay!\~ Like a burst dam, the words came flooding out. \~She swore she'd had everything removed like everyone else, and we thought it was a cancer first, but then we realised. We faked the illness and everything, hadn't even one token to our names for a sacrifice, and then when Aldanti was born, we... gods save me, I didn't have the heart to sacrifice her, even knowing she only has half a soul! Tavanti's not been able to work since having her - we daren't take her to a creche - and I've been struggling ever since. And now you bastards are going to get me locked up or worse.\~

&amp;#x200B;

\~Do the thing,\~ Deja-coss piped up. \~You know, with the token printer!\~

&amp;#x200B;

\~You know,\~ Dukkarin said, grinning from ear to ear, \~I think I will. Cabbantir?\~ he asked, as he pulled out his tablet, \~I promise you this: your *daughter*,\~ he used the English word, \~has a full, whole soul. Fuller than any of ours, I think. It's funny: here I was talking about hope, the possibility of a brighter, better future - and there it was, sitting right among us the whole time.\~

&amp;#x200B;

The flag bridge of the *Relentless* was a bustle of quiet activity as a highly trained officers and humming computers condensed the incoming data from an entire fleet into the holographic display that dominated the room. Standing before it, both pairs of arms clasped behind his back, Warmaster Schekk let the information wash over him, giving his subconscious free reign to see the patterns and data his conscious mind might have missed.

&amp;#x200B;

Magos Shintarno's fleet was arranged in the classic sphere of battle, each ship locked to its neighbours by rigid tractor and pressor beams, ready for an attack from any direction - even from within the concentric globes of warships. Fifty microparsecs away, Archmagos Vollanknor's fleets had one the same, and if their formation was a little more ragged then it was also forty percent larger by number of ships, and fifty percent larger by tonnage. Those were not good odds, not even with the dampening field that the Archmagos had - hopefully - yet to develop or reverse-engineer.

&amp;#x200B;

\~Update from the augurs.\~

&amp;#x200B;

\~No changes, sir. We can confirm however that it is Warmaster Yachat in command.\~

&amp;#x200B;

Schekk nodded, but he'd expected that. As Vollanknor's most senior officer, it stood to reason that he would be in command of the first major set-piece engagement of the conflict. Few others would give Vollanknor as unbiased a report of the mixed fleet as his own Warmaster, after all. And if Yachat had gone with the standard, orthodox approach, what of it? Orthodox strategies were orthodox because they *worked* after all, and Schekk hadn't done anything to cause Yachat to think he was trying anything special either. Given the disparity in tonnage and numbers, the fact that his fleet was made up of elements from a score of rival Magi, not to mention the traditional imperial disregard for casualties, why bother with anything complicated?

&amp;#x200B;

\~Approach to one hundred nanoparsecs under Fire plan Able Two, and switch to Formation Baker and fire plan... fire plan Baker Four.\~

&amp;#x200B;

The two mighty fleets closed steadily, trading long-range graser and missile fire as they did so. Charged particle beams tended to dissipate or get deflected off-course by opposite-charged beams too far from their targets, and the standard jinking and manoeuvring made even the best railguns useless at such ranges, but guided missiles were capable of adjusting their course and gamma ray wavelengths were short enough that the natural diffraction of light would hardly impair their functioning at all, as inaccurate as they were with a light-speed lag measured in whole minutes. Gravitational weapons were in the same boat, being limited to the speed of light and too easily countered by an enemy that had mastered both artificial and anti- gravity for millennia. Psychic assaults were the most effective, and here and there a vessel broke formation or turned upon its sister ships as its crew were overwhelmed, but at this stage the losses amounted to just a fraction of one percent on either side.

&amp;#x200B;

As the gap between the fleets grew shorter and approached the invisible hundred nanoparsec line, so two things happened almost simultaneously. First, the formations shifted, as both spheres flattened and spread out, forming a pair of large, rival discs. Second, the fire being exchanged increased dramatically.

&amp;#x200B;

Shintarno's fleet was lighter, but it had the advantage of the dampening field, and its ships were fully capable of operating on fusion or anti-matter power for hours at a time if needed. Vollanknor's combined fleet had received intelligence reports on the device, but only Magos Cabratto's forces had any real experience against it, and they were clustered in the centre of Yachat's wall of battle. In contrast, Schekk's firepower was focused on the outer layers of the wall of battle, attempting to progressively strip Vollanknor of the lighter, antimatter-fuelled ships he would need for the fight.

&amp;#x200B;

A hundred nanoparsecs was only slightly over ten light-seconds in human terms, and now it was far, far harder to dodge incoming fire. Cruisers, battleships - even dreadnoughts and super-dreadnoughts - began to go down by their myriads as megaton upon megaton of pure energy was blasted back and forth across the intervening void. Yet unlike any Earthly battle it was also beautiful in its way, for the shields of each ship would run the full range of the visual spectrum before they died, and so it was as if two densely-packed walls of spherical rainbows were at war, each one spitting polychromatic lightning into space as straining shield generators and sweating engine-singers dumped all the energy they could into empty space.

&amp;#x200B;

As the great fleets clashed, so the numbers began to tell. Bit by bit, the forces loyal to Archmagos Vollanknor were wearing down Shintarno's fleet.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Hiroaki Nakamura stared into the golden eyes of his wife, communicating on a level deeper than thought itself, revelling in the sheer, unadulterated joy of existing here, now, with so perfect a creature as his wife, and knowing - knowing better than he knew *anything* else - that she felt exactly the same way about him.

&amp;#x200B;

A concept bubbled up from the strange, shared part of their minds - that they should tell James and Natalya. Fervent agreement followed immediately - and then something new. The Songcasting Spire they had been in seemed to change subtly, and they knew, without knowing how they knew, that they were no longer at their home on the cliffs above the Devon family island, but on the fourth world in the system.

&amp;#x200B;

They had just managed to stand up when the door opened and James rushed in, alert and ready for a fight. His demeanour shifted the instant he recognised the Japanese couple however, and he broke out into a big grin as he saw their golden irises. ""Wow - congratulations you two - from both of us!"" he added, as he felt Natalya's agreement in his (their?) mind. ""Sorry about that - I had an alarm set in case anything weird happened in here, and it just went off. I thought you were both back on Avalon?""

&amp;#x200B;

""We, uh..."" Hiroaki paused and shook his head, eyes like saucers. ""This is... weird. Good, but weird. I'm sorry, we... we *were* on Avalon, until just now. Then we were here."" Hiroaki paused and willed the door to open. Sure enough, the corridor beyond was not the one in his home. ""Did we just transport - I mean, teleport - here?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Oh wow. Is it like, just between Songcasting Spires? Or can you go anywhere? What about... no, no, sorry. That can wait."" James forced himself to put an end to the stream of questions. ""God, listen to me. That makes you the second pair of... I don't know, ascended? Super-married? Whatever we decide to call it - damn but I'm happy for you. Come on - Natalya brought the twins here so they could see what I was up to, and she's still around.""

Warmaster Yachat's holographic display vanished, replaced with bright red text that spelt out ""ERROR: SIGNAL LOST"". \~What happened?\~

&amp;#x200B;

\~The emergency jump drive was activated sir,\~ a staff officer reported crisply. \~The main drive is down, as is the bridge... sir, it appeared to be a co-ordinated strike by Magos Cabratto's ships.\~

&amp;#x200B;

Damn! True, they were winning, but it was too soon for this kind of stab in the back! Unless... \~What was the hit ratio for Cabratto's ships?\~

&amp;#x200B;

\~Uh... one moment... eighty-seven percent sir.\~

&amp;#x200B;

Higher than most, but then, her forces *had* fought the most against the rebels. On the other hand... \~Did we confirm those figures, or was it just from their data feed?\~

&amp;#x200B;

\~Just their feed, sir.\~

&amp;#x200B;

\~Full speed to Timolar. The battle is lost.\~

&amp;#x200B;

\~But sir! We could-\~ the staff officer's thought ended abruptly as a Black Guard blasted his mind for daring to talk back to the Warmaster.

&amp;#x200B;

\~The battle is lost,\~ Yachat repeated. \~Cabratto would not have betrayed us alone - she always was a cowardly sort. The Archmagos must be informed of these developments. Now, get me fresh data!\~

&amp;#x200B;

\~Yes sir!\~

&amp;#x200B;

Yachat sat back in his chair and seethed as updates finally began to come in from his augurs, and a clean-up crew hurried in to remove the corpse of the insolent staff officer. The data from the battle was grim indeed: the core of his fleet had abruptly turned on the rest of his wall of battle - it looked like four Magi including Cabratto had thrown in their lot with the traitorous Shintarno. How long had they been planning this?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Warmaster Schekk smiled grimly at the slowly drifting remains of the dreadnought squadron before him. It had been a slaughter in the end - five million warships wiped from the universe in exchange for barely a tenth in losses from the forces of his Magos and her allies. Some had escaped of course - most notably, Vollanknor's Warmaster, Yachat - but Schekk had never seriously entertained the possibility that they could have kept the outcome a secret. Human weapons might have been able to do that, but he had to rely on tried-and-tested conventional arms, and anyway there were observers from all sides scattered throughout the far reaches of system. No, secrecy was impossible, but that was perhaps just as well: it meant Cabratto and her fellow Magi were now fully committed to the overthrow of Vollanknor. The former loremaster would never - *could* never - accept them back after this. Another Archmagos would have, but Vollanknor had always taken betrayal very personally. It was a flaw he had, in Schekk's opinion.

&amp;#x200B;

However, there were other things to do now. It was time to press the advantage, before their enemies could recover and regroup. There were worlds - whole star systems - out there to conquer.

Multicoloured lightning poured from the lone starship as it exited jumpspace and began dodging wildly, all the while headed slowly around the plane of the newly-arrived star, and broadcasting a continuous message deep into the monstrously well defended system.

There, deep beneath his home, James Devon sat staring in wonder at the translated message that had appeared on his screen.

""Did you hear, did you hear?""

""Now THIS is what I signed up for!""

""Apparently they can go for hours, sometimes even two or three times!""

""Aren't we still at war with them though, why would they do this?""

""Technically they surrendered, and we haven't had any problems anywhere near here. Also, have you seen their internet? They are THIRSTY boys ladies, I'm not missing out on this.""

The mess hall was in complete meltdown. Even the usually implacable sergeants, who should probably have been coming down like a bag of hammers on the unusual din were far too preoccupied gazing with flushed cheeks at the small leaflets that had been making the rounds.

'Dearth Village annual orgy, now Shil'vati friendly!'

The rear of the leaflet was a mess of barely censored flesh and tangles of limbs. The sheer amount of male that seemed to be on offer had already overloaded several of the inexperienced ladies in the barracks. They were sleeping off their dizzy spells in the infirmary, dreams no doubt filled with a world of new possibilities.

Even the experienced or bonded Shil'vati were having visible trouble, featuring crossed legs and heavy flushes to a woman.

""I heard recon came back with a full stack of pamphlets lifted from one of the locals. They even got some value out of him in advance, the lucky bitches.""

The sudden and immense surge of leave requests for a specific evening two Earth weeks later was so overwhelming that command was forced to declare a random draw. Several officers were soon caught trying to sneak their name on the leave roster and were subsequently banned from participating.

As the names came out of the hat, the lucky girls who were called cheered and hollered in joy. There were very many disappointed soldiers that evening, and some very lucky ones who found it harder and harder to sleep as the date neared.

\---Turika---

Captain Turika Avaan of the 45th Mech core was one of the lucky ladies. The 45th had no male soldiers or auxiliary staff, which was not uncommon, but did mean that the girls were some of the most frustrated of all the Shil'vati amongst the occupying forces in the human city of Perth, Australia.

As the highest-ranking officer among those drawn, she had been approached by the brass within a day. A quick search of the human internet had quickly turned up many... interesting and promising results, and there were no rules against mingling with the locals. She was reminded, firmly, that she was a representative of the Shil'vati Empire and what that entailed.

This area of the human home world had been under the control of a government that did not allow easy civilian access to even the most underpowered of firearms. Humanity had developed a sinister reputation among the occupying forces of being too damn good at making those primitive kinetics work against soldiers whose armour should have been more than up to the challenge. The lack of those weapons here when compared to most of the other continents was a contributing factor in allowing the troops their downtime.

Of course, there may have been a very real chance of dereliction of duty had NO ONE been allowed to attend the human... party. It was even rumoured that some of the brass was planning on attending themselves and that there had been a separate, secret lottery held at command. These rumours remained unconfirmed.

Turika stretched languidly on her bunk. Several of the troops had been paying her out over her luck, and she took the opportunity to look extra smug every time a jealous gaze was cast in her direction. She spent the final evening of her long wait openly ogling the small pamphlet, occasionally peering more closely at a specific male, and fantasizing about exactly what she might do with him.

Eventually though, nervous excitement gave way to her body's need for sleep. She took the time to preserve the pamphlet, slipping it into her latest finished letter to her sisters back home and neatly storing it per regulations. As darkness took her, she couldn't help but chuckle at the imagined looks on their faces when they saw just how lucky she'd been.

Walking out to their waiting transport had been one of the best feelings of Private Matchi's life. She had been stunned when hers was the very last name called in the draw, and the claps on her back from jealous peers and friends, as well as the whoops and hollers from the ones already called had echoed in her mind for days afterward.

In truth, she was nervous. She'd grown up in an all-girl household, her father had died from a tragic accident while their family unit had been relatively small. All her life she'd known only her three sisters, their mothers and her own, who had battled through their heartbreak to give their children proper lives and opportunities.

The natural consequence of her upbringing were that she remained a virgin, completely unacquainted with males outside of pornography and wild, largely unrealistic fantasies. As the sleek metal carriage drew to a stop in front of the waiting soldiers she fidgeted uncomfortably, unable to contain herself. Taking a quick glance around she noticed that at least a few of the others were as nervous or more, and took a deep, calming breath.

'Maybe I'll just find a nice quiet man there' she could not help but think to herself. She had, of course, spent the last week puffing herself up in front of the others, loudly boasting that she would take at least two at the same time (several internal meltdowns had followed that claim). Now she could barely even keep her thoughts straight. Looking around at the others in the transport she was at least glad to know she was not the only one.

The boasting and lewd gesticulations had given way to a strange kind of silence. Many of the women had the look of a prey animal in the sights, their situation suddenly hitting them all at once. The human internet had been a window into untamed fantasy and now it was about to become reality.   
Even the more experienced among them couldn’t help but be daunted. What if they just couldn’t keep up with the others? Nobody wanted to end up a laughingstock.

""Yo! Betcha I can get at least twice as much dick as anyone else!""

The sudden proclamation from one of the privates broke the ice like a nuclear-powered sledgehammer. Suddenly, the transport was again filled with cat calls and hollering, so much estrogen charging the air you could choke a Tar'wal on it.

A flurry of snack foods flew at the perpetrator, who laughed and ducked back into her seat. The air suitably cleared, Matchi glanced about to take proper stock of her surroundings, mind cutting away some of the fog that had been creeping at her senses. There had been 60 names called, 20 soldiers to a transport. The village was outside of their fast response area, so they were accompanied by an APC with five on-duty soldiers who would be remaining with the transports overnight.

The transports were forced to moderate their speed due to the use of human roads. As they flew past utility and civilian vehicles, antiquated combustion engines that churned their filthy exhaust into the air, the convoy attracted plenty of attention. On two occasions the APC had trained its weapons on vehicles that appeared suspicious, but both issues had resolved themselves. The first ute had pulled out in front far too slowly and been forced off the road. Another had turned out to be piloted by an elderly male human, who cursed out the amused soldiers as they passed.

""Even the ones past their prime have plenty of spirit!"" a delighted corporal remarked to plenty of cheering.

The two-hour journey soon came to an end, the transports swinging smoothly into a roadside stop around \[500 metres\] from the town centre. Stretching out their nervous jitters, the Shil'vati peered curiously around at the town.

Most had only ever seen human cities before, the stone and steel slab like buildings the extent of their exposure to human architecture. Dearth was different. Gone were the messes of steel and the neatly laid out rows of residential housing. Here, it seemed everything was built mostly around a single block with a main road running through. The horizon on one side was a forested green carpet that stretched out as far as they could see. In the other direction was a mound of sand dunes, behind which  the ocean, a deep blue darker by factors than the pale, clear sky above, could just be glimpsed.

It was pretty, Matchi supposed, as she gazed about. A far cry from home, the differently coloured sky casting an entirely new colour palette upon the otherwise recognisable and universal features of a garden world. Earth was her first posting, and suddenly she felt the urge, inexplicable, to see more of what worlds she could. The golden yellow light of the Earth's sun was harsher than she had ever experienced though, and she quickly drew a shawl up over her neck, noticing others doing the same.

Suddenly, she realised they were being watched.

Two muscle-bound locals had rounded a corner down the street walking towards the convoy. One was carrying a long line attached to a medium sized furry mammal that Matchi recognised tenuously as a 'dog', the humans preferred hunting, working and companion animal.

Several of the soldiers noticed at the same time, and catcalls and wolf whistles quickly filled the air. Rather than the typical confusion Matchi had seen most human males exhibit in similar encounters, these two seemed to lap it up, one dragging his shirt up slowly and making extremely suggestive tongue movements as he flicked it over his... oh my...

""G'day ladies!"" The other called, leering just as appreciatively in the other direction. ""We looking forward to tonight?""

Oh my gods it was happening.

Several of the soldiers looked like they were about to go and get themselves a quick sample of what was on offer, but were quickly corralled back into line by the few officers still in possession of brain cells.

As the passing locals rounded the far corner and disappeared from view, the clamour finally died down to a reasonable level. The troops were organised into a loose formation. Their accommodation and the venue for the night’s activities were one and the same, and so they began trudging down the road towards the largest building in town, the Dearth Community Centre.

A stark contrast to the brick and tin structures that made up the bulk of the houses, the Community Centre had been built off the back of a particularly generous government grant pre-invasion. Two stories tall and massive, it was elegant and modern, with a roof that swooped and sang a quiet song through a series of pipes in just the right weather.

As the troops filed through the town, the attention on them began to grow. Soon enough, like a scene from a cheesy old-school porno, a small swarm of topless male humans in short shorts were following the procession of soldiers down the main street.

Private Matchi's blush had been steadily growing as their followers' hoots and hollers began to drown out even the catcalls of the soldiers. Gone was the militaristic in-step and proud march. In its place, a herd of giggling Shil'vati schoolgirls were barely shepherded by equally affected officers into the relative quiet of the community centre.

And not a moment too soon. Matchi was mortified to feel her panties squelch between her legs as she minced into the air-conditioned interior of the building. Her fellow soldiers weren't faring much better, nipples could be seen tenting most tops, and they all but fell into the room in a hormone-addled pile of horny purple flesh.

""We'll G'day there! You gorgeous ladies must be our Shil'vati guests'' a low voice growled alluringly at them.

Matchi whimpered, this was far too much. Behind a slick terminal stood a man dressed in form-fitting business attire. He wore it casually, untucked shirt tight against his slim, wiry figure. A jet-black mess of hair partly covered his deep green eyes, and he smiled slyly at the puddle of Shil'vati soldiers in his doorway.

He was also, Matchi noted, as an electric tingle of arousal shot down her spine, packing some serious heat. Her eyes had slid down his frame before she could stop them, and if the size of his bulge was anything to be believed...

""Merciful Goddess"" she couldn't help but moan.

One of her fellow privates slumped to the ground, completely out cold.

""Oh no!"" The human exclaimed, his concern clear in his tone. ""The Aussie heat must have done her in! Just a moment...""

He quickly picked his way across the room and disappeared behind a door. When he returned, he was carrying a folded damp towelette and a cup of water.

Hurrying over to the fallen soldier, he knelt beside her, knees together, and began to dab at her face with the towel, gently wiping the sweat from her brow and cheeks.

""Hello love, can you hear me?"" He cooed with his perfect voice, and Matchi fell in love.

The private's eyes flickered briefly, sliding open by fractions. When they fell upon the human kneeling over her, they widened slightly but did not fully open, almost like they were trying to hold onto a dream that would otherwise vanish.

The human looked on with concern. ""You need to drink my dear, just hold on a moment.""

He folded a corner of the towelette and dunked it into the water before pressing it to her lips. A trickle of water ran into her mouth, and she swallowed once before, gazing into the eyes of an angel and with a dopey smile on her face, her eyes rolled back up into her head and she fainted again.

""Crikey, she's in worse shape than I thought!"" Matchi's future husband, the most perfect male to walk the face of any world exclaimed. ""Don't worry, I'm going to get her some help. The rest of you, please wait here and make sure to rehydrate, I wouldn't want anyone else to fall ill.""

With that, he scooped the ailing private up into his arms. Before any of the Shil'vati could object, and with surprising strength, he was standing, cradling her in his arms like some warrior Prince of legend.

*Whump, whump, whump*.

""Oh mercy!"" He exclaimed at the rapidly growing pile of unconscious soldiers now twitching on the floor. ""This is getting beyond my capabilities. Please just hold on and I'll send for help right away!""

Within moments, the human had placed a call and was tending to the new fatalities. (Matchi could have sworn that one of them had opened and closed an eye just then). As he tended to them, she couldn't help but feel a rising jealousy, she wished she'd thought of that. Maybe it wasn't too late? She did feel a little faint...

The front door slid open, and two new humans rushed into the room.

The first one through was a burly, blonde-haired bear of a man. He was wearing olive-drab clothes that would have been baggy on anyone else, but his bulging muscles filled them easily. The bright reflective stripes and yellow hard hat with insignia identified him as a member of the local fire brigade. His chiselled face was adorned with a tiny scar beneath his defined cheekbones and bright blue eyes that surveyed the room in an instant.

The second man was tall and had almost as commanding a presence as the first. Brown haired with deep hazel eyes, he was dressed in a long white coat. An outdated stethoscope hung from his shoulders; he was clearly a medic of some kind.

As the pair of humans swept into the room, the mid-afternoon sun shone straight through the open doorway, bathing them in a heavenly light that accentuated their masculine features. Half the company swooned to the floor in an instant, eyes rolling back as the air was filled with a dense cloud of pheromones.

""This looks bad, but you folks are in good hands"" the medic exclaimed, rushing to the pile of Shil'vati, which had begun to leak. He smiled, brilliant white teeth shining, and Matchi's legs grew weak beneath her. He caught sight of her, looking deep into her eyes.

""Don't you worry sweetheart, I'm a doctor.""

And Private Matchi knew no more.

\---Turika---

Captain Turika's embarrassment knew no bounds.

The entire party of Shil'vati had made a miraculous recovery, coming-to in dribs and drabs.

The humans, thankfully, had only questioned them insofar as to make sure that they were okay- which did NOT help at all, as several troops nearly succumbed once again to their masculine wiles.

Turika had been forced to bullshit, and bullshit hard. She was quite proud of her on-the-fly excuse- that their bodies were merely adapting to the hotter climate and that they were VERY MUCH BETTER NOW thank you very much. A very normal quirk of Shil'vati biology, no need for concern.

Fortunately, the humans seemed to have bought it. Still, it had eaten nearly an hour of their afternoon and put their entire evening's activities in jeopardy. Unacceptable.

Conveniently ignoring the claw marks she'd carved into the flesh of her palm, and her now ruined panties, she was proud to say that she was one of the only Shil'vati still standing after the humans’ display of raw machismo.

Herding the greatly subdued troops into their temporary barracks had come with its own surprises. As they'd been expecting, it was to serve as both their accommodation and play area. What they hadn't been expecting was the decor.

""By the goddess and the eternal void!"" A voice had cried out upon entering.

One full half of the gymnasium had been covered wall to wall in fuzzy rugs and cushions. It was a lush, plush, pillowy wonderland, intermittently strewn with jumbo-sized bottles of lube. That much- while enough to send their minds into a state of stupefaction, had been expected.

What had not been expected were the contents of the other half of the room.

Like something out of the most perverted teenage girl’s fantasies, it was a jungle gym of straps, ropes, harnesses, pulleys, benches and much, much more.

An entire wall was dedicated to sex toys of every size, shape and colour. A cheerful, cartoonish sign with the words TRY ME &lt;3 hung suspended from the roof.

A row (a whole ROW!) of sex swings in different configurations displayed their own signage (15min, 30min, 1hr). A partition in the far corner featured a number of glory holes, some even had benches set up in front of them. There were two large x-shaped restraint boards standing nearby, fitted with masks and ball gags.

Whips, riding crops, tickling devices and blindfolds. Dildos, vibrators, buttplugs and anal beads. Hooks and several fucking machines. Everywhere they looked, the debauchery just grew and grew. There were even screens set up in several places with shelves stacked full of what looked to be porn. Some of the screens...

Turika squeaked a most undignified squeak, before slamming her palm over her mouth, her face blooming from hot and flushed purpley-pink to scarlet red.

Most of the screens were displaying somewhat standard scenes, the likes of which an experienced adult might consider par for course. The ones in that corner though...

Male on male. Turika watched as a slim human grunted and groaned, lowering himself down onto a larger man's...

""EYES FRONT! ROLL CALL!"" She screamed, tearing her eyes away from the hot... Oh sweet Goddess that was hot... scene.

Before realising her mistake. Yes, this left her with her back to the screens, but it also gave much of her cadre a clear view of the action. To their credit, they made it halfway through roll call before she had to resort to counting purple heads. Good enough.

""Alright ladies, we have half an hour to eat and make pretty before the main event starts and the locals start arriving!"" she hollered, finally eliciting a reaction from the group. ""That being said, we are now officially on R&amp;R leave, so you may spend this time as you wish! Just remember that you are representatives of the proud Shil'vati Empire! Conduct yourselves with grace and decorum! Dismissed!""

""Um..."" One soldier stuck her quivering hand up, her wobbly legs and flushed face plain to see.

""Yes, Lance Corporal Lani?""

""What if we're into that?""

""What?""

""Well"" the Lance Corporal fidgeted ""They have a whole section labelled for naughty, dirty sluts and... What about, well... Not to say that it's me I'm thinking of but...""

""Lance Corporal.""

""Yes ma'am!""

""You will conduct yourself with the grace and decorum of a Shil'vati soldier, do I make myself clear?""

""Yes ma'am..."" The LC slumped a little, as did several of the other soldiers, looking disappointed.

""However...""

They perked back up a little.

""So long as you make it clear to your... partner... that you are a proud and honourable soldier with the ability to decide for herself what she likes or does not like... Do you take my meaning Lance Corporal?""

""YES MA'AM, HAPPY TO SERVE MA'AM!""

""Alright, alright, save that kind of talk for the humans Lani. Fall out, all of you. We've lost too much time as is and we have a lot to fit in.""

The soldiers tittered at the dirty joke as most hurriedly began to eat. Some had already taken off to check out the wall of sex toys or else wandered over to sit beneath the screens. More than one pair were already making out, warming up for the main event.

Captain Turika grinned between bites of her ration pack. One thing was for sure.

&amp;#x200B;

*Whilst the humans of Avalon deal with the question of whether or not to negotiate with imperial Magi, Vollanknor begins to realise that the empire is like a house built on sand - and that the storm so far is but a prelude of what is yet to come...*

&amp;#x200B;

""So what do we do?""

&amp;#x200B;

As was becoming tradition, the Devon family lounge was playing host to the human population of Avalon - though this time most of the women were absent, having dispersed to Earth just hours before the imperial ship had arrived. A holographic image of the transmission played over the coffee table, complete with English translation thanks to the house's underground computers. Magos Julttir - a sinuous, vaguely flatworm-like creature with a pair of disturbingly human-like arms - must have had quite an extensive network of scouts to have located Avalon so quickly, and to have figured out that this new star system was the cause of all the trouble in the empire spoke to his intelligence. His envoy, one Emissary Vimnor, had been permitted to bring his ship into Avalon's orbit, although not before William Maynard had taken steps to cloak the inner shells of defence stations from the ship. Vimnor likely knew they existed - a big enough array of telescopes could in principle spot the Devon household from well beyond the range of Avalon's sensor network - but at least this way he'd find out nothing more about them.

&amp;#x200B;

""To be perfectly honest, we'd be happy just blowing them out of space,"" James said, speaking for both himself and Natalya. ""But, much as I hate to say this, there may be some strategic utility in this.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Excuse me, but we don't have anything to fear from a Magos, do we?"" Kaito asked. ""I fail to see what we could gain from dealing with one.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Information mostly,"" James replied. ""Magos Julttir must have better data on things the neighbouring sectors than Shintarno did. Plus, we could use their ship to try and slip an AI or three into their computers. I assume they'd lie about anything they gave us themselves, but we could ask that one of us goes to get the data personally.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Did the envoy say what his Magos wanted out of this?"" Tom asked, studying the looped holographic video. ""I'm not agreeing to any kind of treaty, but a trade might be doable. We've got a lot of hardware just sitting around that we could use.""

&amp;#x200B;

""We don't know anything yet,"" Natalya said, ""but we agree: no treaties. We don't - we *shouldn't* \- say anything that will give them that idea, but we agree that limiting it to weapons might be the least bad option.""

&amp;#x200B;

""The least bad?"" Wolfgang asked, confused. ""Not medical help - or food or something?""

&amp;#x200B;

""They'd pervert it somehow,"" Tom replied. ""You want to keep a prisoner alive whilst you torture him? Better have a good doctor on hand. Heck, didn't you say how Dukkarin and the other Vraks liked pizza?"" he asked James and Natalya. ""Right, so you make pizza a reward for obedience, or lace it with dodgy chemicals or something. But we could use Hiroaki's mechas as a sort of mercenary company - fighting to *our* standards - or sell a bunch of those bombs James made when you two were starting out. Could they mess those things up?""

&amp;#x200B;

""We doubt it,"" James replied thoughtfully. ""It wouldn't be hard to install some security measures into them just in case, but as far as deaths go... well people are going to get killed regardless of whether we interfere or not, but at least those bombs would make it quick. So, should we at least ask what they want from this deal?""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Leaving the Black Guard war-choir assigned to him on board, Vimnor floated down the shuttle's ramp and studied the three bipeds arranged before him. It was a body design shared by many species in the empire - a careful balance of flexibility, energy conservation and redundancy - though he'd never encountered anything like the silvery mirrors of their psychic forms. No emanations from them at all - he would have to rely on whatever ability to translate the One Tongue the humans had.

&amp;#x200B;

""In the name of Magos Julttir VI of...""

&amp;#x200B;

James stood at parade ground rest, Tom and Hiroaki flanking him, as the envoy rattled off a list of titles and the little translator clipped to his belt rendered it into English. The Mollindar's voice seemed high-pitched and rather feminine to his ears, though he was pretty sure the alien before him was a male of the species, and he wondered if the small size of their lungs had something to do with it. The language seemed excessively flowery and formal, but with any luck this was intended as a mark of respect - well, of flattery at least. The spiel finally came to an end as Vimnor asked the three of them who they spoke on behalf of.

&amp;#x200B;

""Ourselves,"" James replied. ""There is no Magos on Avalon.""

&amp;#x200B;

Vimnor mentally dialled down his linguistic style, then thought about it briefly and dialled it down some more. Whoever the local ruler was, if he didn't want to make his presence known that was fine - he was used to dealing with other envoys and mouthpieces after all. ""Very well, Avalonians. My Magos, Julttir VI, having observed your war with the most honoured Heptarchs, and having long desired to increase his demesne and might amongst the rulers of the empire, believes that we may both benefit and grow in power by co-operating, and perhaps more easily achieve our desires.""

&amp;#x200B;

James turned to Tom, who remained poker-faced as he looked back. ""And what do y'all want from us?"" he asked. ""Have a rival Magos you'd like snuffed out?""

&amp;#x200B;

If only they were psykers! Vimnor knew of the side-bands of thoughts, and how they could unintentionally so much of a person's true thoughts, but to have to rely on words and body language - *alien* body language - was dreadful. ""Whilst such aid would be most appreciated, my Magos is known to be a cautious person, and would not wish to bring imperial wrath down on either yourselves or his own august person by agreeing to such an overt sign of your support. He is however willing to provide you all with every manner of pleasure you could desire, or such other items as you may wish. As a token of his good will,"" Vimnor directed a thought back towards his shuttle, ""he sends this gift.""

&amp;#x200B;

Two dark armoured forms stepped down the shuttle's ramp, each of them holding a long chain. At the other end of each chain was a person - a slave - naked save for the bindings around their wrists and the hoops that, attached through the flesh directly to the bone of what would be the upper breastbone in humans, connected them to the chains the two Black Guards were gripping.

&amp;#x200B;

""Psych-slaves from my Magos's personal stable. Tested and trained of course, but never used. The Vrak's skin I'm told is particularly sensitive, and of course fresh Bereshi is a noted delicacy.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Tom, take them to the holding cell downstairs and keep an eye on them."" James gave the Texan a very significant look, thankful for the old stiff upper lip - not to mention the fact that this was the first time Vimnor would have seen a human.

&amp;#x200B;

Tom looked like he was trying to shatter his teeth, and the look in his eyes - thank God he was wearing sunglasses and had his hands in his pockets - promised nothing good for the envoy. ""Sure,"" he managed, not daring to look at Vimnor. He took the two chains from the Black Guard and strode away, fast enough that the two psych-slaves had to trot along to keep up. The two Black Guards returned to the shuttle as Tom left.

&amp;#x200B;

""We have no particular desire for material goods,"" James said at last, once Tom was a good few yards away, ""but we would be interested in information about the empire. Hiroaki?""

&amp;#x200B;

Vimnor listened to the previously silent human, studying his features intently. This one had a slighter build than the other two - a younger form perhaps, or the female of the species? Male and female Vraks were very similar, so perhaps these beings were too? No... on second thoughts, they were probably all the same sex here, which was a pity - he was curious as to what the females looked like, for the sake of the report he'd have to write if nothing else. No sign of children, but then again they would be at a creche at this time of day. He wondered idly how their minds would taste, and their flesh. As an envoy, he'd had plenty of chances to sample both from almost every species in the empire.

&amp;#x200B;

""I believe we can come to an arrangement,"" he said, as the third human - the one the leader had called 'Hiroaki' - came to an end. ""Astrogation data is readily available in my Magos's palace, should one of you wish to visit. But... what may my Magos expect in return?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Let us show you the iBomb.""

&amp;#x200B;

___

&amp;#x200B;

James watched the shuttle climb up into the atmosphere, weighed down by its cargo of warheads - and Hiroaki, who had volunteered to visit Magos Julttir's palace in James's stead. Along with a miniature computer packed with all manner of weaponised AIs of course - he had everyone from Skynet to GLaDOS slumbering quietly, waiting only to be slipped into the imperial computer network.

&amp;#x200B;

As for him... he needed a distraction. Conjuring up a laptop, a squared-off stone pillar and a familiar white and black device, and with a mental thumbs-up from Natalya, he stepped off Avalon and onto Earth.

&amp;#x200B;

Inside, down near the control room, he knew Natalya was there, sat down opposite Tom and passing the Texan her twins. ""Keep an eye on those two,"" she said, ""whilst I talk to these two.""

&amp;#x200B;

Natalya stepped through the door, warping the metal around her rather than bother to open it, and turned on the translator on her belt. ""My name is Natalya. What are your names?""

&amp;#x200B;

The Vrak glanced quickly at the Bereshi and back again. ""Whatever Master Natalya wishes.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Do you not have names? Designations? Something to distinguish you by?""

&amp;#x200B;

""No Master Natalya.""

&amp;#x200B;

""I see. Well, first, drop the 'master' business: I'm just Natalya. Second, you two need names. Hmm. What are your sexes?"" Natalya looked at the Vrak - not that different to Dukkarin, but the scaly skin was more of a pale blue and the build was slimmer. The Bereshi... well it reminded her most of a bear, but she'd not seen many of them so far.

&amp;#x200B;

""This one is female, that one is male, Ma- Natalya,"" the Vrak replied.

&amp;#x200B;

""Okay. So... Anna and John, I think,"" she said, making sure both aliens knew whose name was whose. ""Any problem with those names?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Annakaren and Johnasht, M- Natalya?""

&amp;#x200B;

""No: Anna and John. We don't use species suffixes here."" She felt James give her a mental pat on the back: they *would* do this. ""Now, the third thing."" The chains and bindings dissolved into nothing at Natalya's thought, though the holes left by the hoops drilled into the breastbones remained. Anna whimpered as she watched the bone mend itself, and the flesh begin to seal up, healthy and whole.

&amp;#x200B;

""M- Natalya? This one begs for understanding,"" John said, as he dropped to his knees alongside Anna. Both had their foreheads pressed against the floor, kowtowing before her.

&amp;#x200B;

""We don't have slaves on Avalon,"" Natalya said. ""The air here is too pure for slaves to breathe."" That was James's thought she'd verbalised, she realised with a start. Just how close *were* their minds now? ""We know you don't understand now, but we promise you will.""

&amp;#x200B;

___

&amp;#x200B;

The apartment was small even by imperial standards, and their was a strange smell as Dukkarin sniffed the air curiously. \~What is it?\~

&amp;#x200B;

\~The baby. I think it may be sick,\~ Cabbantir said as he followed Dukkarin inside his home. \~We've been trying to feed it nutrient paste like the creches have, but it's not eating properly. We don't... we just don't know what to do!\~ There was a definite note of panic in his mind-voice.

&amp;#x200B;

Well this wasn't what I expected when I left Avalon, Dukkarin thought to himself as he noted olive-brown stains on some of the furniture. No prizes for guessing which member of the household had made *those*. \~Hmm. Tavanti?\~

&amp;#x200B;

\~Here,\~ she replied, poking her head out of the small kitchen, and keeping the rest of her - likely holding baby - out of sight. \~Cabbantir? Who's this?\~

&amp;#x200B;

\~The Vrak I told you about. He used to be an engine-singer, and he may be able to help.\~

&amp;#x200B;

\~I'll certainly do my best,\~ Dukkarin promised, looking at Tavanti. She looked a little unhealthy - probably a result of being stuck in here since the pregnancy became obvious, he thought. He stepped forward to get a good look at her - hmm. Her flanks weren't very swollen - weren't they where the mammary glands were in all the porn videos? Damn - if only he had Natalya here!

&amp;#x200B;

\~Cabbantir? He's just standing there.\~

&amp;#x200B;

\~I'm trying to think,\~ Dukkarin replied. \~Okay, first thing - Cabbantir, go and buy some proper food with the tokens I gave you. Tavanti, what do you drink?\~

&amp;#x200B;

\~Just the tap water - we can't afford anything more.\~

&amp;#x200B;

Dukkarin stepped past her into the kitchen and fished out a little device, which he flipped open and from which he extended a thin antenna #about six inches long. Turning on the water and plugging the sink, he half-filled it and stick the antenna in. A small holographic display popped up from the device, and he frowned. ""Can't make head or tails of this,"" he said out loud in English.

&amp;#x200B;

""One moment,"" the little device replied, to Tavanti's surprise.

&amp;#x200B;

Dense text filled the display, and Dukkarin scanned it, eyes darting to key words and phrases with practiced ease. \~Well, it's what I half suspected. Chemicals in the water supply are messing with you and your baby.\~

&amp;#x200B;

\~With me? Why? How?\~

&amp;#x200B;

\~I'm going to need to build a filter - buying one would be too risky. Then feed your baby from your milk glands.\~ He indicated both sides of Tavanti's body. \~That's what they're there for.\~

&amp;#x200B;

She stared at him in disbelief. \~Get outta here.\~ When Dukkarin just shrugged she looked down at her body and back up at him. \~For real? Gods be praised, I never knew that. Here, look how many I've got too.\~

&amp;#x200B;

\~Maybe more babies at a time is the norm,\~ Dukkarin suggested. \~Just eat well, make sure the filter is working - I'll show you both how it works - and let me know if any other problems turn up.\~

&amp;#x200B;

Tavanti's face turned abruptly crestfallen. \~What's it cost him, engine-singer? I gotta know. You said you'd given him tokens as well. That kind of help... what you after?\~

&amp;#x200B;

\~I...\~ Dukkarin paused. What *was* he after? To bring topple the empire - sure - but for him, personally? Redemption? Salvation? Just peace of mind? The smile of a little girl when she grew up? \~It's free - no, really, it is,\~ he added as she began to protest. \~Knowing that she will grow up healthy and whole, able in time to have her own children... honestly, that's reward enough.\~

&amp;#x200B;

Tavanti gave him a queer look. \~You're an odd one, you know that right?\~

&amp;#x200B;

\~I wouldn't have it any other way.\~

Shintarno pushed aside the bloody sack of bones and organs with her mind and gestured expansively towards a large bench. ~So tell me, what news from the dear Archmagos?~

&amp;#x200B;

~I have heard he has not been seen since news of your victory reached him, my Magos,~ began Tamkaren, Shintarno's wiry and almost painfully lean spymaster. ~Magos Cabratto shared certain information with my representatives, and it appears he may be preparing for an escape should the war continue to go against him.~

&amp;#x200B;

~My Magos, our scouts report that Magos Gonanti has pulled her forces back to guard her Magos-world. It may be she has been frightened into neutrality,~ Schekk put in.

&amp;#x200B;

~Pity it's just her - she never did have a particularly large industrial base. Still, that is good to know.~ Shintarno's scalpel peeled off another section of skin from the psych-slave on the floor, and she drank deep of its pain and terror. Was there anything more delicious? On second thoughts, perhaps there was: success. Victory and power over her enemies - now *that* was best in life!

&amp;#x200B;

~What of the humans? I take it we've not heard from them?~

&amp;#x200B;

~We have no idea where they or their star system went to,~ Tamkaren admitted. ~But there have been indications from elsewhere in the empire that the Heptarchs have gone to war - and not amongst each other.~

&amp;#x200B;

~A plague on both their houses,~ Shintarno said, quoting from one of the human texts she'd downloaded during the *Scientific Imperative*'s trip to Earth. It was a good line too, and so typical of that fiendishly creative species. If only her servants had that kind of imagination. But she was getting distracted, she realised. ~I expect the Heptarchs will squash them sooner or later - the Null Zone is proof that the gods could beat the Usurpers, and the Heptarchs are said to be able to call upon their weapons. So that's all to the good.~

&amp;#x200B;

~But if they can't?~

&amp;#x200B;

Shintarno fixed Tamkaren in place with her eyes. ~You think the *Heptarchs* could lose to a pair of humans?~

&amp;#x200B;

~I only raise it as a possibility, my Magos. In my ignorance I can only speculate.~

&amp;#x200B;

~In many ways I hope you're right,~ Shintarno admitted. ~Imagine the galaxy with neither Heptarchs nor humans - oh, the possibilities that would entail!~

Please include this post in the screenshot anons.

\&gt; I'll bite. How's the war going?

We're doing well. Heavily outnumbered, but it just means we're in a target rich environment so it's all good. Bad guys have some crazy superweapons, but we're managing. Touch wood they're too busy with us to notice Earth.

\&gt; Have the greys been abducting people?

We don't think so. Nobody lives within about five hundred parsecs of Earth that we know of, and we're pretty sure nobody even knew about Earth until the last year. Glowies is more likely.

Fuck it. Hey, NSA guys. This anon, this one here. Find him, and fly him out to Antarctica, let him lick the big dome or draw Pepe on it or whatever. All expenses paid, lots of recordings, all that. Dewit.

\&gt; Where's Ultis II and Killiki IV?

About 650-ish parsecs away, towards the galactic core. They orbit main sequence stars, but they're giant rings like Iain M Banks Culture orbitals, not planets. Honestly I'm not sure if your telescopes have enough resolution.

\&gt; Can we join you?

Hate to break it to you anon, but The Last Starfighter was just a movie.

\&gt; Why'd you say you couldn't believe this was real last time?

As expected i am stuck in this fucking steel cell again but is it really steel?

Because ya'know this is an alien planet or station or whatever i'm just wanted to go out of this thing so i experimented the hardness of the cell by smashing it with my food bowl after a few try i stopped the bowl doesn't break so is the cell but it can move right?

So it got to have some kind of mechanism doing this right maybe i can find it.

But i shot that idea down because this thing have no screw what so ever but even if i managed to find it i probably have no idea on how to operate it.

As the minute goes by i waited for the door to open so i can go into the stadium full of aliens that have come here to watch alien fight other alien for their own fun.

Also why didn't the field have other corspes?

Why does it only have the ones i've killed?

Is it because others alien fighter don't kill their's opponent?

Is it only just me who murdered my opponent?

Is that the reason i got darted? Maybe that's the reason i got darted because i always murdered my opponent in the most grusome way possible maybe that's the only reason i got darted.

So maybe i don't have to murder all of my opponent to win maybe i just have to knock'em out still i don't know if that really true or not so i got to try and not kill my next opponet.

The door to the arena field finally opened after some time of me waiting around thinking about stuff and onto the fighting ground i go!

My opponent this time is of course bigger than my last it dinosaur ass is about 7'5 feet tall it got armor plating and sharp claws but no fangs it also got a weird mounth that's only good for roaring because it's roaring right now when the roars ended it as expected charged at me.

I dodged it successfully it then proceed to crash into the wall of the arena it scream out in pain after that it attempted to claw at me but since i am smaller i use fury of the small and strike below the belt of it and by that i meant it gut not the balls it of course scream and attempted to claw on me again but i ran out under it's tail of it's reach.

When we both come to a stand still this time i charged first i go into a defendsive stance but i goes for it's knee i kicked it and because knees only bend one way it scream out in pain and went it goes down i goes for it neck i attempted to suffocated it the attempt was not successful i got smacked to the ground with ridiculosly strong force it went to stomp on me went i am still gasping for air but i rolled away dodging it.

I goes again but this time i am out of patience and in rage i goes under it and i used the art of punching the balls i punched that thing full force and it goes downed while screaming in pain from the balls punch i delivered to it.

And i proceed to just stand there doing nothing i'm not going to kill you this time.

The narrator voice showers thru the arena talking about something and i guess i won because the door to my cell opened to me i goes in the cell because what else is there to do?",/r/HFY/comments/nuaw1u/pit_fighterround_4/,17

A2_(Emerald) Bipedal Reptilian resembling a dark green gecko with a prosthetic tail


H1_(John Summers) Human_American speaks with heavy ""southern"" accent, large scars on upper primary joint(shoulder) and secondary joint(elbow) from torso carrying some form of six cylinder firearm


H2_(Paige Summers) Human_English tall and notably muscular with double helix tattoos wrapping around both manipulators(arms) and disappearing underneath clothing on the torso


?_(?) ???


A1: We initially considered humanity to be a great addition to the galactic community and atleast at present I can say me and the majority of my fellow defectors since again consider them allies.


A2: Then General Vera Hyagraz may I ask why you and your people instigated the… what was it the humans called it?


A1: The Chimera War of 2704


A2: Yes thank you, can you elaborate on the series of events that led to the start of the war and a 31 galactic standard year manhunt for your leaders? (28.96 Earth years)


A1: I can try but I feel you would be more likely to get satisfactory answers if you asked him. [Point's to very obvious camera in the corner of the room]


H1: [Entering room] Now don't be like that, the whole point of this is to see what information you know, what orders you were given, and where you where stationed.


A1: I understand the principles behind such actions, I simply feel they are dishonest.


H1: Then how about all of us sit here and have a nice calm chat, HELL I'll even shoot that camera if you want.


A1: That sounds incredibly wasteful.


A2: Agreed


H1: [Sitting down] Nobody ever wants to see my quick draw.


A2: We're getting off topic, please resume explaining the period of time before and beginning the war.


A1: Unlike most of my information regarding the political aspects of the war I am certain about this, the first incident occurred three cycles past our primary  solstice.


H1: The ""Quinet incident"" I presume?


A1: Yes, the elders declared that a Human crisis response ship identified as ""The Dawn's Saints"" had entered our borders by roughly half a lightyear.


A2: This isn't what your ships' records have logged, they state that while the ship was human it was the infamous heavy warp cruiser ""Saint of War"" the spearhead for the fleet of ""The Saints of War"".


H1: So you're telling me that our largest humanitarian ship enters into your occupied space while attempting to join a rescue effort for the Unaghtra two system past yours and you do what?


A1: The elders declared that it was a trick there was no reason for a rescue ship to be there and as such it must be a trap intended to destroy us, it was quickly captured and boarded with occupants who refused to be detained shot for noncompliance.


A2: But there was a reason the intended target of the ship was a gathering of starving and wounded refugees, who had sent out a Potential Extinction request for aid which allows responding ships to travel through any and all territories currently on allied or neutral terms.


A1: Military officials were all too late to realise this however and while they did immediately release the ship even going as far as to give them a military escort they had still delayed it by almost a galactic standard week. (8.3 Earth Days)


H1: So you ignored a distress call and attacked the ship attempting to answer it.


A1: Yes


A2: And how much of that do you believe was true?


A1: The ship was likely stopped purposefully to prevent the arrival of aid and the incorrect ship name was likely intended to act as technical or translation error to justify the response.


H1: I don't suppose you could tell us why your elders would want to delay aid to the Unaghtra people?


A1: No, I could list likely reasons such as resources, land, a potential vassel world but ultimately I know less than you.


A2: Well did you know about the damage to specially prepared medical equipment for the Unaghtra refugees?


A1: Mostly  through rumors, however human delegates came demanding legal reparations for the equipment but offered an eerie and ominous thanks claiming that ""if it wasn't for you guys we would have never made this medical breakthrough"".


H1: And do you know what that breakthrough was?


A1: I can only assume it was the Cross Species Anti Rejection Procedure.


H1: Ding ding ding, give the boy a prize.


A2: John SHE is a female!


H1: My apologies ma'am, I'll be honest I didn't read your file and it's difficult for me to tell males and females of your species apart from one another most of the time.


A1: It's fine, but back to the matter at hand your C.S.A.R.P. allowed you to use medical grade artificial tissue designed for humans to treat other species with no documented case of rejection.


H1: And more importantly use more physically capable species as the base for artificial limbs grown and then transplanted to an individual.


A1: Like your Mantis Unarmed Combat Platoon?


H1: Oh yes especially those boxers, when we realised the potential of what we could do one of the first questions was ""how hard could we make someone punch"" as stupid as that sounds we used it as one of the initial tests.


A2: Wait, how did a medical procedure to prevent tissue rejection make super soldiers?


A1: Yes please elaborate as it seems we still lack critical information to understand the point you are trying to make.


H1: Oh then you need someone more qualified to explain it, trust me my sis will do a better job of it than me. [Puts two fingers to mouth and whistles]


H2: [Over intercom] You could at least ask politely.


H1: Sorry


H2: [Entering room with a large opaque glass tube under her arm] Well for starters humans have been growing and  reattaching limbs and organs since 2205 but we could never entirely prevent rejection however the procedure allowed use to take inspiration from deathworld flora and fauna allowing us to scale their abilities to human size.


A2: Hello Medical Director Summers.


H2: Good Morning Emma.


A1: I still don't understand.


H2: Well if both of us lost an arm could you attach the other's arm to yourself?


A1: I want to say no but I feel as if I'm wrong.


H2: Only half wrong using the procedure would prevent rejection but because of the difference in nerves and muscles the limb would be essentially useless, you'd be better off just getting a prosthetic like Emma's tail.


A1: Then how are you able to use these incompatible limbs?


H2: Firstly we determine the bare minimum of features needed for it to function as the limb it's replacing, then using that as scaffolding to hold other tissue we begin to grow foreign muscles, nerves, tendons, and ligaments. [Places glass tube on the table and begins to turn a knob, slowly revealing it's continents]


[Inside the tube is a large humanoid arm appearing to be covered in red, green, and blue chitin]


H2: This is the Odontodactylus Scyllarus Organic Buster, nicknamed the Boxing Glove.


A1: And this can be assimilated by a human? 


H2: Yes, with the only special care needed being a specific diet sometimes requiring vitamin supplements.


A2: Thankfully blackmarket versions of the procedure are few and far between.


H1: Yeah, I'm getting tired of arresting assholes who can fly, see in pitch black, and burn you with a touch of their skin.


A1: This is available outside of military personnel!?


H2: Yes but mostly for decorative purposes, for anything that gives you a certain edge over other humans you need licenses and permits.


A1: So you humans despite being the most cunning and dangerous animal on your planet decided to splice yourself with physical characteristics of more dangerous fauna.


H2: And Flora.


A1: What does that even mean you gave them thorns or poison?


H2: We gave them semi-retractable skin on the palm of their hands which allowed them to conceal fine hair like needles based off of Dendrocnide moroides. A plant with such a strong pain response that many affected individuals would choose to kill themselves, he was great for interrogations.


A1: So you gave someone the ability to make someone kill themselves with a handshake.


H2: Oh, he wore special gloves to avoid those kinds of situations though he did spank John when he found out he was dating his sister.


H1: Had to remove about twenty-five square inches of skin from my ass and pump me full of pain meds.


A2: As much as I want to see all security footage concerning these incidents we are getting very far off topic.


A1: Sorry


H1: Sorry


H2: Sorry


A2: Now, Vera you mentioned the Mantis Unarmed Combat Platoon so should I assume you encountered them before defecting?


A1: Yes, they were one of the first ground based groups to appear after the official declaration of war against the elders for participating in the possible extinction of a sapient species.


A2: And your Impressions of them were?


A1: It is hard to describe we didn't see them for the longest time we would only hear a loud thud or crack and discover one of the watchmen in a pool viscera, the terrain of vultra prime one of our frontier planets proved to be ideal conditions for hit and run tactics that humans seemed to excel at.


H1: And when was the first time you met them face to face?


A1: We had found a single human we Identified as a scout sleeping on a large branch, upon approaching him we began to notice that he was heavily wounded, after weighing our options we came to the idea of using him as a bargaining chip to be taken as prisoners of war. 


H1: You would willingly be taken as prisoners of war, was the situation really that bad?


A1: You have to understand at this point in time we were down to a tenth of our original forces and this was the first human let alone injured we had seen. Anyways after coming within roughly twenty feet of him he awoke and prepared to open fire, we held our hands in the air and dropped our weapons to signify surrender. We observed as he used a transmitter to request medical assistance and a transport vehicle he jokingly called a ""paddy wagon"".


A2: And I should assume he was a Mantis Platoon member?


A1: No, he was an ordinary human as far as I could tell but the same can not be said for the individuals accompanying this ""paddy wagon"". I would have assumed they too were normal humans if it weren't for their bulbous arms and blood stained knuckle padding, they looked like the god of fist fighters if there is such a thing. 


A2: And did their appearance frighten you?


A1: Well their appearance wasn't so frightening as it was surprising, what frightened me was after our detainment when one of them casually put their arm on my shoulder while we were having a discussion. The weight and hardness of it felt as if I had tried to catch a falling tree.


H2: Oh yeah, the muscle density in those things was off the charts and that chitin may as well have been steel. Hell they weighed so much that for the earliest models we had to implant additional muscle to support them.


A2: Paige, now is not the time for bragging so please unless it is absolutely necessary don't disrupt my investigation further. At first I tolerated it partially to be polite and mainly to appease my own curiosity, but I feel we've wasted too much time when this session could've been over and done and we could've hit the bar.


H2: Good point, let's wrap this up so we can get a drink, you might even be able to pull some strings and let Vera here come with us.


A2: I'll see what I can do after we're finished. Now Vera do you have any additional details you would like to add about after your detainment?


A1: The P.O.W. camp was very hospitable and our treatment as you call it ""humane"" we shall return this kindness in full by helping you to find the remaining elders wherever they may be hiding. 


?: [Over Intercom] That's what we've been waiting to hear, with the power granted in me by Sol System's Human Alliance I grant you Vera Hyagraz the rank of Captain with exclusive leadership over a company consisting of Mantis, Scythe, Buzzard, Mole Rat, Huntsman, and 8th Plague Platoons. You'll do well to live up to our expectations, also you're cleared to go drinking with these idiots, however be mindful that you have briefings and introductions to your platoons at 0600 so be careful of how much you drink cause first impressions are very important.",/r/HFY/comments/nuxnid/first_story_hope_yall_like_it/,10

Kendrick could not believe the absurdity of everything that had occurred so far.

He had gotten himself ambushed by a squad of alien soldiers, ostensibly for pissing off this ‘Leva’ out in the booth. Then, after being scared shitless they might abuse their authority, he embarrassed their leader so badly he actually feared for his life momentarily. Somehow her anger was directed *away* from him to the marine who teased her first. Then she put his boss on blast with a hint of a threat of imminent big purple violence.

And now?

Now they were offering an excuse to play hooky from work just to satisfy their curiosity, and mess with the woman who started this whole mess?

His mischievous side wouldn’t let him pass *that* up.

But first things first...

“Before we jump back into this ‘questioning’”- He put air quotes around that word. From the left, he started pointing at each of the girls and reciting their names.

“Grikel, Valran and Ciltari...right?” The replies took the form of eager head bobbing.

“Nice to meet you, I’m Kendrick.”

Remembering his earlier mistake, he extended his fist for them.

All three thrust their own fists out to meet his. Tapping each of them lightly, he began.

“I had a couple questions of my own to begin if no one minds. First, couldn’t you all get in trouble for this? What if another person gets selected and sent back here?”

“Not very likely to happen, we usually only pull a couple cars a day now. There hasn’t been any security issues for a few local years now and anyone up to something will just take the long way around the checkpoints anyway. If we do need to pull another in while you’re here another pod will take care of it.” Valran fiddled with one of her tusks for a moment while she spoke, and he had to strain a bit to understand.

“Pod? Is that like your squad?” There were four of them, so it made sense.

“Yeah, normally we use 3 woman teams but we rotate everyone doing the jobs here at the checkpoint so one pod usually splits up and joins another to fill in spots.”

“Valran and Ciltari form the remainder of my pod, Pelrinn’s language skills make her ideal for leading the inspection team, so her pod is currently divided among other duties” Grikel added some insight.

On to the question that had been bothering him a little while...

“So why did Ciltari get the blame for me teasing you earlier Pelrinn? You looked like you were about to take my head off for a second there…”

All 4 purple faces suddenly looked deadly serious, though he could see a slight hint of blue in Pelrinn’s cheeks.

After a moment Ciltari leaned forwards and spoke in a lowered, almost conspiratorial voice.

“We can’t just... beat you or anything without a *really, really* good reason. Getting a reputation as a ‘boy-basher’ is a really fast way to ensure you die a lonely woman. Maybe a powerful noble could get away with it, but definitely not commonborn like most of us.”

The rest nodded in agreement.

That made perfect sense with that kind of gender disparity. Males would avoid you and the other females wouldn’t want any guilt by association.

“Alright, fair’s fair I suppose. What was the next question?”

“Why are you single?” Ciltari repeated her unanswered question from before.

Ugh… He really hoped they might have forgotten. A deal’s a deal though.

“Like I said before, it’s a long and complicated answer. It starts with some big societal norms shifting around half a century ago when women in the western world pushed—that’s what most well-developed countries were collectively called before— to become more career oriented. Nothing wrong with a woman working for what she wants, but it kind of created a snag when it came to relationships…”

This was feeling more awkward by the second but he plowed on.

“... Women— human women I mean, don’t like to ‘marry down’. They only want to marry a guy who has the same or more wealth than she does. That’s practical sure, but then they started to pull ahead of men in education and careers as time went on until on average they were doing slightly better.”

One of the girls spoke up.

“Wouldn’t that make it harder to find a mate? More women than desirable men would put them in the same situation as we are.”

“Yeah, it seems women are finding it tough to find a guy they find worthy who are *their age*. Meanwhile, men generally make more money the older they get, which increases their attractiveness to the women. So they loop around once they are older and richer and marry younger women, men can afford to play the long game since they can have kids at any age.”

When he didn’t get a follow up he came back from his ‘mental translating space’. This was the first time he was having put a lot of these things into words in real time, and the longer he spoke the more of his brain power it seemed to take. He had stopped *seeing* as he spoke a little while ago.

All four girls had gone quiet and were varying shades of blue. A moment later Ciltari nudged Valran with her elbow, speaking out the side of her mouth in a hushed tone.

“If they can fuck at any age...do...do you think we should try ‘patriarch hunting’?”

“Cil... half the human ‘patriarchs’ I've seen look like they would break a few moments in....”

It didn’t take a genius to figure out what ‘patriarch hunting’ was.

“Are you playing your so-called ‘long game’ then? Accumulating wealth until women will desire you as a husband?” Grikel’s choice of words was always very proper sounding.

“I guess? I mean— I make and have a lot of money now, but nothing to really *show* that yet. I can probably outright *buy* a house in a few years, sooner if I'm lucky and the housing prices come down.”

“Buying a home signifies enough wealth for human females?”

“It’s a big thing for them, yeah. No girl wants to date a guy if he doesn’t have a place of his own to...spend time together…”

The implication was pretty clear, as there was another round of blushing, him included this time.

“Okay, but we don’t really mind that stuff...so why can’t we get your males to even look at us? We’ve heard you guys love casual sex too!” Ciltari asked with concurring nods from the rest.

Another tricky question, but he had kind of expected it at this point so he wasn’t caught flat footed.

“I mean...you haven't heard *entirely* wrong, there's a lot guys and girls do almost nothing *but* casual sex. Those kinds of people aren’t the type you should really want to sleep with though, I'm not sure how good your medicine is but one night of fun isn’t worth a lifetime of itching, oozing and other gross stuff down there.”

He could swear the room was quieter now.

“I honestly think you girls have a reputation problem more than anything else, but that problem is kind of a big one right now. The main thing is you girls kind of invaded our world, and are still occupying it right now.”

Some of the girls looked like they wanted to object, Valran beat everyone to the punch. “You're part of the Imperium now too though! Same as the rest of us!”

“Are we though? I sure don’t feel like it. My life has barely changed since you came. I didn’t lose anyone when our militaries were blasted from orbit, but a lot of people did. Anyone who is seen getting close to a Shil’vati can get into some deep social trouble, you know, a lot like what happens to those ‘boy-bashers’ you spoke of, but worse.”

“How worse?” Ciltari asked.

“Their friends, maybe family would probably abandon them, might lose their job since it would be a liability to the employer...and worse case...physical violence or death. How bad it can be would all depend on where in the world you are though. A country like America to the south of here had a *huge* military, so you probably can’t throw a stone and *not* hit a person who lost someone in the invasion.”

“How long do you think before that attitude changes?”

“There are countries and groups where the people hate each other for things that happened hundreds of years ago, humans are stubborn like that.”

That sobering statement had them all a lighter shade of purple than before.

“Wh-what about here though?” Pelrinn asked, the rest of the group looked nervous.

He’d heard areas around the First Nation reserves were still kinda dangerous, the ‘new management’ weren’t pushovers like the old government, so they stopped getting any special treatment. A few other places too but nothing too serious most of the time. A lot of people compared it to local kids throwing stones at foreign tanks.

“Canada had a pretty small military, so it’s nowhere near as bad around here, and I haven't heard of any rebel or terrorist attacks or anything for years here. Worst that would happen is probably getting shunned by some people.”

There was a collective sigh of relief.

“So does that mean we still have a shot?” Ciltari asked pleadingly.

“Sure, I don’t see why not…”

Ciltari practically bounced with glee, the others did a better job hiding their excitement but the sense of relief was palpable.

“Okay, so *where* do we go to try and find a guy willing to have some fun? We’ve tried bars, and the gyms all have ‘men only’ hours…”

He chuckled at that, remembering the incident that made the local gyms and pools have gender segregated hours. He was glad it hadn’t happened to him, but the clip of the middle aged Polish immigrant describing to the news cameras how he fought off a big, naked, horny alien became a viral meme for a reason.

“I don’t really know how you guys are going about hitting on guys at bars, but I would think bars aren’t going to be the best place to look for willing partners anyway…”

“Why? Isn’t that where everyone goes to get drunk, have fun and maybe fuck?”

He could hear a pin drop now, and he found the sight of four huge purple women hanging off his every word gave him a sense of...power? Respect? He wasn’t quite sure what he felt, but it felt nice.

“What I mean is... bars are usually full of social, outgoing people. Remember what I said about the social consequences of being seen as a ‘purp-lover’? They are the *last* people who would want to kill their own status associating with ‘the enemy’.”

“Is that what we are? The enemy to your people?” Grikel asked. He felt that hint of danger from when he first observed her return.

“You? Here on the ground, talking to me like this? No.” He was surprised how hard his voice sounded. “You, personally, are not the power hungry, expansionist empire you represent. Just like I'm not the *primitive*” —he practically spit the word—”new subject race you guys think are totally fuckable that I represent.”

That one had been building up for years. He’d hated that word since he had seen recordings of speeches given by Shil’vati officials in fancy clothes championing how the Imperium would lift humanity “up to the stars''. He imagined they thought it sounded magnanimous or something, but it just felt like him and his entire species were being called interstellar neanderthals.

“...but you are though.” Ciltari said, drawing sharp inhales from the others.

“*CILTARI*.” Hissed Pelrinn.

That was it, he was going to let her have it, consequences be damned! His hand came up, pointing at her with his elbow cocked at hip. Kendrick could feel his heartbeat start pounding in his chest and his face felt hot.

“NOW LISTEN HE—” He started shouting.

“...totally fuckable, I mean.” Ciltari winced.

“I...uh...wuh?” He stumbled. The anger was gone instantly, but his face still felt flushed. The previously accusatory fingers journeyed up to rub his eyes, and all he could do was gently shake his head. His heart— and guts for that matter— couldn’t take the constant whiplash this morning had been serving up anymore.

“Things got a little heated there so this might be a good spot to wrap this up…”

“Way to go, cunt-for-brains.” Valran said as she cuffed Cil upside the head. He saw Pelrinn glaring at her too, but she held her peace.

Unperturbed by the blow, Ciltari pleaded. “But he was just about to tell us where we might land some cock!”

“Well, you ruined it coming on too strong. *As usual*.”

He mostly just needed to get to a bathroom at this point, but he couldn’t— wouldn’t— tell them that the stress was playing havoc with his stomach.

“Listen, if you still got questions about human stuff I can just give you my contact number and I can get back to you okay?” He would have promised a lot more if it meant getting to a familiar toilet sooner.

All four of the lavender ladies froze.

“You’d just...*give* us your number? Just like that?!” Ciltari asked, hesitant.

“I mean...sure?” He wasn’t sure why that was such a big deal.

Everything was still for a moment then, as one, they all rushed forward. Bending down slightly to stand at his eye level they all had their omnipads in their hands faster than he thought possible. It was so startling he almost stepped back, but he stopped himself. He felt like a baby in a cradle being introduced to the extended family.

After each girl got his number —and each made him repeat it individually to them— Pelrinn spoke up for the first time in a while.

“I suppose this ‘questioning’ has gone on long enough, your inspection is complete.” She said, a slight smile —and blush— on her features.

He gathered his things from the table and moved towards his car with Pelrinn trailing a little behind. As he opened the door and got in he looked back to her.

“Even though the start was a little scary, that was actually kinda fun. Thanks for the excuse to skip a little work.”

“I really enjoyed this as well. Thank you Kendrick.” She was still flushed a little.

He turned the key, starting the engine while buckling his seatbelt. After checking his mirrors to ensure the girls were all clear, he followed Pelrinn’s hand signals and backed out of the bay. Shifting back into drive, he pulled ahead onto the roadway. In his rearview he could see 4 black-clad figures watch him go.

He couldn’t help but grin.

After an uncomfortable 15 minute drive, he arrived at work. He was still grinning.

“I can’t walk in there with my face like this after *that* phone call…” Kendrick mused to himself.

Pondering a solution, he settled on pinching his arm in a few places. When that didn’t work, he slapped his right cheek a few times in the mirror. His grin finally subdued, he jumped out of his car and power walked into the shop.

\~\~\~

Leva turned back between vehicles, and saw the little white car was finally gone. She opened the pads messaging program. She still had Pelrinn pulled up from before and tapped a quick message out and hit send.

&gt;Took long enough, you let him go so he can’t have had something. What happened? -Leva  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Nothing happened. It was a completely routine inspection. -Pelrinn  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Turox shit. You four didn’t do anything...did you? -Leva  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Do not confuse me with my sister, of course not. -Pelrinn  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Then why did it take so long? -Leva  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Well, the four of us *did* get his number… -Pelrinn

Leva’s eyes threatened to bulge out of her skull, and she nearly crumpled the pass in her hand as she thrust it through the opening back to the frightened driver at the booth.

One hand frantically waved the unsure motorist through, while the other started tapping furiously.

&gt;We all agreed to *share* if we found one! -Leva  
  
&gt;  
&gt;We thought that since you wanted us to “make him squirm” you didn’t like that one. -Pelrinn

“GAH” She growled, her fingers flexing and curling around some invisible ball in frustration.

&gt;That’s cheating and you know it, you Empress damned traitors! -Leva

She slammed down on the pads display switch, blanking the slate. The first male to show any interest since they landed on this rock, and she had served them up on a platter.

All she could do was groan in frustration as the next driver pulled up to the window.

\~\~\~

Imran saw Kendrick rush into the shop. He knew Kendrick was late when he heard his boss screaming about “stupid fucking eggplants ruining his stupid fucking business” loud enough to be heard, even over the machines. He was about to call out to him when he saw the urgency in his walk.

Kendrick passed the stairs to the boss’s office, right past the door to his station and almost took the door off the hinges entering the bathroom.

He looked back and forth from the office door to the bathrooms before settling on his choice.

Imran waited until the cutter on his machine was in the air, threw the feed dial to 0% and started toward the stairs. When he got to the top he had to bang on the door to be heard over the din of the machines. When he heard a muffled “Come in!”, he opened the door and stepped into the room. Mr. Davies was sitting behind his computer looking very grumpy. He was surrounded by files and paperwork, though the chaos seemed entirely contained to his desk, the rest of the small office nearly spotless.

“Well, what is it? First Kendrick is held up at a checkpoint and now—” he gestured in his direction with a flailing hand clutching a pen “—whatever this is.” Demanded his boss.

“That’s just it Sir, Kendrick just came in…”

Mr. Davies started to rise from his desk. “*Finally*! First that fucking shit with the forklift, then he gets himself held up by the eggplants, This morning can’t get an—” He froze when he saw Imran’s hand raised to signal he wasn’t finished.

“Sir...when he came in half of his face was red, and he rushed straight into the bathroom.” Imran finished.

Mr. Davies sunk back into his chair, his face slackened.

“Did he say anything when he came in?”

“No Sir, right to the bathroom.”

“Fuuuuck, first they force all the shops to start taking jobs from them, and now they start roughing up my workers…” He groaned.

While the workers didn’t know too many of the details, it wasn’t hard to figure out what the Shil’vati military had contracted them to start producing. Thick, durable, interlocking steel barricades were starting to pile up in every spare inch of the facility. They had no idea when they would arrive to retrieve them and it was getting on everyone’s nerves, especially Mr. Davies’.

“Can you do something for me son? Can you wait for him to come out and check on him for me? I’m not good with this stuff. Just tell him to go to work. First Roger and now this…” Davies pleaded.

Imran just nodded twice.

Mr. Davies thanked him and waved him away.

Imran made his way toward the bathroom and stood a little off to the side, standing beside the newly damaged forklift waiting for Kendrick to emerge. He inspected the damaged side of the forklift. The large, orange cowl that would normally shield its internal parts and mechanisms from damage was torn wide open. Before he could inspect it further he heard the door open and Kendrick walked out.

Imran walked over and called out to him. Kendrick heard and turned to face him, and moved to meet him halfway. Up close, he noticed that he looked *exhausted* in a way he had never seen the man. Not only was one side of his face red, he could see a line of dark red spots running along the pale skin on his forearm. He could also see his shirt looked a little damp around the collar, from what he could not tell.

“Hello Kendrick…” He began awkwardly. “We heard you had some problems with the Shil’vati at the checkpoint. Are you...*okay*?”

“Yeah man, just—” Kendrick let out a sigh as he spoke— “it’s just been a really long morning.”

“I understand...so does Mr. Davies. He said that when you come in you can just go straight to work, he doesn’t need to see you.”

“Really? That’s pretty nice of him…” Kendrick looked relieved.

“It’s no problem...and if you need to *talk*… about anything just let me know, okay?”

Kendrick looked puzzled at that statement, and his eyes wandered around. Maybe he was considering opening up to him? His expression changed to surprise when his gaze fell on the damaged forklift.

“I guess if you wanna talk about something, we can start with what the hell happened to the forklift? I know it didn't look like that the last time I saw it!”

If he wanted to avoid the question, that was the man’s choice.

“Ah, Roger was driving it and took a corner too sharp. Something caught the cover and it ripped open. The forklift still works though, as long as we don’t get caught driving it during an inspection we should be okay…”

“Roger has been here almost as long as I’ve been alive, it’s kind of surprising he would get…” Kendrick trailed off. “It’s that time of year again, isn’t it?” He finished with a question.

Imran just nodded.

Roger’s son’s birthday was coming up, but it was no cause for celebration anymore. His son was in the armed forces, and the anniversary of his birth and his death were only separated by a few days.

“Is he okay?”

Kendrick was a good man, concerned for Roger even after whatever he was just put through at Shil’vati hands himself.

“Yes, fine.”

“Well, I should get to work, after everything this morning I have a lot of work to catch up on. Good talking with you Imran.”

He nodded once in reply and watched Kendrick disappear behind the door heading to his desk.

Imran walked back upstairs, the door was ajar which was probably for him, so he walked right in.

Mr. Davies looked up and asked. “So how was he?”

“He looked...nervous, his shirt was damp and his arm had a bunch of dark red marks beside the mark on his face.”

“Dark red marks on his arms?” Mr. Davies looked like he was trying to reason an explanation. “How many did you see?”

“4 or 5 Sir.”

Mr. Davies looked from Imran down to his hands which were cupped in front of him. The hand on top turned over and the fingers splayed out in front of his face.

A moment later. “Fingers.”

“Fingers?”

“Big, purple, fuckin’ fingers.”

Imran understood. They were probably finger marks…

“What should we do?” Imran asked softly.

“Nothing kid, we can’t do a damn thing. Our complaints will likely fall on deaf ears...Did he say what happened?”

“No, he even changed the subject when I told him he could talk to me.”

“Poor guys probably embarrassed enough as it is, if he doesn’t want to speak up it’s not fair for us to drag him out and force the issue.”

Imran just nodded. If the man wanted, he could take it to his grave. It wouldn’t be right to dig it up on him.

“Thanks Imran, keep an eye on him for me will ya?”

“I will Sir.” Imran said as he backed out of the room.

\~\~\~

Kendrick slumped down into his chair, then placed his phone on the desk next to his keyboard. He had hoped he had kept Imran busy long enough for the bathroom to air out a little, but he couldn’t be sure. Imran had been acting kind of weird though, maybe it was just because of the forklift thing?

He had just opened his next job when his phone chimed once. As he reached for it it chimed again. Before he finished unlocking the screen with his fingerprint it sounded a third time.

3 new messages.

The first was from a new contact labelled “Valran”, the second and third from another new contact labelled “Ciltari.”

*Oh no….what have I done*…

\~\~\~

It was evening and nearly dark when Roger came through his front door. He didn’t even bother turning on the lights as he trudged through the house towards his bedroom, still wearing his boots. When he reached his destination, he kicked them off and sat on the edge of the bed as he unbuttoned his shirt, taking it off revealing the stained tank-top underneath.

He reached into his pocket and placed his phone down next to the Memorial Cross on the nightstand. He had to buy the medal on the internet. The damned CAF hadn’t even sent it to him, they had crumpled and folded too quickly to send anything to the next of kin.

Roger pulled out a second phone from beneath his mattress, turned it on and started tapping on the old little bricks number pad.

&gt;Foods almost ready, waiting for all guests to arrive.

Send.

Everything had gone perfectly today, and luck was on his side when something happened to another worker involving the Shil to distract from his ‘accident’. Scuttlebutt was the Marchand boy got mugged or something by some marines, but no one wanted to ask him to his face.

He thought for a moment, then started typing another message.

&gt;Might have more family coming, will let you know.

Send.

Roger turned the phone off, placed it back under the mattress and went downstairs.

Stalking to the kitchen, he opened the fridge and picked up one of the beers that lined every shelf in it. The kitchen hadn’t seen a home cooked meal in years. Nearly six years had gone by since Jeremy was killed, and a year later his wife was gone too.

He picked up the landline and picked one of the numbers penciled on the wall at random and dialed. He would always just order whatever was on special for delivery. He didn't like having to think about it anymore.

Order completed, Roger walked out to his front step with his beer, sat down, and *waited*.

7,nxynzb,HFY,Sat Jun 12 07:38:50 2021,Codex: Humanity Summary," **Not sure if this has been done but here is my take on a codex of Humanity using information gathered and summarized for Alien Races upon contact following Humanity's introduction to the greater galaxy. I did this today since I was bored, hope everyone enjoys it. I have been busy with my college classes as of late and have been planning out a series of codex's and stories surrounding them.**   
**If you wish to use this codex for Narration, I am giving preempted permission.** 

This codex was formed by the 2956th Galactic Council following an investigation on the species known as Humans. 

Humanity is a conglomeration of several species of the genus Homo. Of the Subspecies, Homo Sapien Sapien, modern Humans which have recently come onto the galactic scene are rather interesting. 

On the Human homeworld, one named Earth which orbits Sol and is orbited by Luna, has 6 continents. The continent known as Eurasia consists of 3 subcontinents and thousands of islands and is where several of the world’s major powers reside with another residing on the continent known as North America which connects by landbridge to the continent known as South America with several dozen islands between and around both continents. The remaining three continents are known as Australia (AKA Death by natural selection), Africa (AKA Alkebulan), and Antarctica (Penguin Land). Australia seems to be a land that would in and of itself be uninhabitable by many species because of its extreme temperatures and its radiation of species. Antarctica is a tundra desert with extreme cold for most parts of the year and is only recommended for scientific expeditions. Africa is the birthplace of the ancestral species to the Homo Genus along with the Paranthropus, Australopithecus, and the general Primate Order. 

\[Map of Earth\]

\[Solar System Map: Sol System (Pre Mining of Asteroid Belt)\]

\[Picture of a Biological Model of Humans\]

The Human birth land is known to be the southern half of the continent known as Africa with the species Homo Sapien only evolving and combining with related species such as Homo Neanderthal and Denisovans to create the modern species of Homo Sapien Sapien. The species radiated to be extremely different from each other with nearly every trait aside from their general skeletal and Muscle patterns which tend to stay the same with only the change of robustness or gracility. 

The species is considered on their own planet to be an artificial A rank predator, natural D-C Rank with only their ability for rapid growth in intelligence to be the reason for that change. The Humans are a Polygendered race with three extremes of Masculinity, Femininity and Absence. Compared to many intelligent species, Humans are rated as extremely low with regards to their sexual Dimorphism or the difference in general form between their Sexes, often described as Male, Female and Intersex. The species has no natural claws or tearing teeth and are bipedal with medium quantities of Hair at mostly small lengths with patches at the top of their body being ornamentally grown to be strong, often representing cultural, religious, or spiritual significance. Their hair types are described as Straight to Curly phenotypes with natural colors ranging from a yellow tone to black in youth to often gray to Black in old age. The care of their hair is of significant importance due to the cost in time and product in it. Additionally they are an omnivorous species with recent trends towards both Carnivorous and Herbivorous diets being common. Important to note is that they along with all known life on their planet are Levo species with inability to consume food from several species. (Ability to eat food from other races is a particularly interesting ability that is available because of their extremely complex and hardy Immune and Digestive systems.) 

Though relatively common, pack bonding is, The Human ability of Pack Bonding is extreme with some developing deep emotional attachments towards inanimate and non sentient objects such as simple rocks. Theory on why is that Humans have the ability to impart meaning on any object with deep symbolic meaning upon such objects. 

Upon learning how to colonize other planets in their system, they quickly worked to colonize their entire system with up to 500 orbital platforms surrounding each lunar body of importance or population. They have managed to mine a majority of their asteroid belt and commonly capture comets and rogue bodies for harvesting of material. 

They are an extremely resourceful species that are driven for whatever movement they join to extremes most sentients find to be both exhilarating and dangerous. Their sense of general balance is natural and graceful. Recommendation for All species to extend peace as any war will be extremely costly towards both sides but Humans will grudgingly destroy their own resources before allowing them to be captured.",/r/HFY/comments/nxynzb/codex_humanity_summary/,9

Chapter 17- Cat's Paw

They kissed goodbye at the door that morning. Mel’bae heading off to her shift and Travis staying behind. He gathered up the bedsheets and put the mattresses back into the bunks. Then gathered up the clothes they wore yesterday and added them to the pile. That squared away, he hung up his yukata in the room’s locker, turned on some late 60s and early 70s rock on his omnipad, and began working out. After basic sit-ups and push-ups he started his stretching exercises, the same ones he did every morning. He worked out his neck, shoulders, wrists, hips, knees and ankles with a series of self imposed locks, bending and twisting himself slightly past the point of pain. He then sat on the floor in *seiza,* his legs folded up underneath him. Leaning forward, he took deep breaths in and out forcing the bad air out. He then sat up straight breathing in through his nose pulling air into his lungs from his abdominal core. Travis tried to reach a state of *mushin,* a state of no thoughts, while it was nearly impossible to remove all thoughts from his head, he could let go the ones that came in. Just peacefully let them float away.

*Sometimes.*

After a while he stood up. Performing a few more stretches and rubbing his feet to get the blood flow to return. Sitting in *seiza* for hours, even on hard wood or in this case metal floors wasn’t difficult when you got used to it. Getting back up again on the other hand…. Anyway next was *kata*, solo practice. He visualized a training partner attacking and began moving through a series of counter throws and pins. Though not as effective as a live training partner, due to not having any resistance or weight, it was valuable for muscle memory. With his practice done, Travis took a shower. scrubbing himself with the perfumed soap provided. While a Shil’vati’s natural scent might smell good to his sensibilities, he knew the reverse was not true. In some ways he was prepared for this. A common stereotype the Japanese have about westerners was that they all smelled bad. While living there he had been terribly self conscious about that;howering twice a day (three times a day if he went to a public bathouse to relax) with a soap deer hunters use because it claimed to eliminate almost all human odors. He wasn’t at that level of paranoia anymore, mostly because he wasn’t training on the mats five to seven hours a day anymore, so he simply used the Shil’vati soap and antiperspirant that was provided. Also because the only human made body care products were cans of AXE body spray at 3 times what they would cost on earth.

*No thank you, even if they were half price.* He thought.    

After toweling off and brushing his teeth, Travis dressed in his usual T-shirt and pants. He then gathered up their clothes and bedsheets, minus Mel’bae’s outfit from last night. He had no idea if the machines would hurt that fabric, and he was not going to risk ruining it. He put them in laundry bags and grabbed the omnipad, opening the file with the map of the areas he was allowed in. Following directions he walked down the passageways to the nearest laundry room. He passed a few sailors on his way there. He felt the eyes of these ladies roam over him, but they didn’t say or approach him. Travis did his best to walk forward, eyes facing front. He had learned from Nosis that this is the usual method men in the galaxy use to signal that they are not interested. For him it was a bit difficult. His usual way was to look at everyone. However, he didn’t get catcalled or approached, so there must be something to it. *Same rules apply, ladies* he thought about his time bouncing. *You can look, but no touching.*  

He walked into the empty laundry room. He had picked this time mid shift in order to have less people in the facility, it seemed to be working as he was alone. Walking over to the machines he loaded the bedding into one and the clothes in the other. “I heard you were a fighter.” The voice came from his right. Travis turned and faced where he heard the voice from. Standing there, as if she had appeared out of thin air, was a chestnut brown furred Rakiri.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Travis lowered his stance and prepared for a fight, but he kept his hands down by his sides. He didn’t want to provoke anything if he could avoid it. “I’m not really a fighter. Well, not professionally, my art doesn’t encourage competitions, unlike some others.”

“Art?” a puzzled, or what he thought of as being puzzled, look came over the Rakiri’s face. 

“Umm, yes.” Travis relaxed a little, not completely off his guard. But it looked like this Rakiri wasn’t looking to charge in like some kind of alien predator. Though with their impressive height and build the Rakiri fit that category quite nicely. “What I do is called a martial art. That's a way of moving that came originally from combat techniques. It can be used for self defence, but it’s also a philosophy and a way of meditation and stress relief. I’m sorry, What’s your name?”

“Ranginal, I run the claws and fangs of this ship.” 

*Claws and fangs? That has to be some euphemism,* Travis thought. “This sounds interesting.” 

Ranginal moved over to one of the machines and picked up a laundry bag of their own to fill the machine. “We Rakiri have something similar, but it’s separate. If you want to learn to fight, you go to the war mistresses,” looking over to Travis with a toothy grin. “Like I did. If you want to learn stillness you train with the hunt mistresses. And philosophy? That’s like a way of thinking? Yes?'' Travis nodded in agreement. “We learn that from our pack leaders and parents.”

“So, do you spend time training in each discipline?”

“Not enough,” Ranginal confirmed. “Some take more to the hunt, or to the fight, and to be truthful, rarely do we practice all of them.” 

Travis took the borrowed ship’s omnipad over to the Rakiri, he played videos of Aikido training. Ranginal looked at the movements with interest.

“I’m planning on having a class on ship in the exercise room sometime, if you are interested you can try it. Do you have your omnipad?” 

Ranginal removed it from the belt that the Rakiri was wearing. Travis logged into his messenger and connected it to the Rakiri’s messenger address. “There I’ll let you know when it is when I get it organized. Let me know when you are not on shift, so I can try to fit you and the Marines schedules together.”

“You spar with Shil’vati often?” Raginal looked a bit confused. “Don’t you find them...well, *forward* towards your person?” Travis looked puzzled. 

“I mean… Well, humans have a reputation as being most of what a Shil’vati looks for in an ideal bedmateI heard your species used to walk after your prey till it died. And that stamina makes you….” 

“Well… My wife has yet to complain.” Travis said laughing. “But to be honest, I have no idea if that is true or just a made up story.  Besides, we learned how to throw this rather quickly. As far as the Marines go, I’ve been training many of them for about 6 months now; so, to them, I’m just the teacher, not a male.”

With their laundry done, they headed back to their respective quarters. Travis left messages with the Marines in his class to find out what times they were available. Then messaged Mel’bae about what time she was available for lunch.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Lunch was in the mess hall. This time it was just Travis, Mel’bae, Brem, and Lijung. Trynell and Ko’ar were apparently having a lunch date with one of the ship’s engineers. She was a medium sized woman with a mess of piercings in her ears and lips. *Probably other places too*, Travis thought. The Ladies at his table were talking shop. So Travis used the time to message the dojo’s students. 

*My students now.* 

He felt a bit of butterflies in his chest. He was now a Sensei, and a Dojo Cho, the leader of a school. Even if it was only himself and six others, currently*.* The messages came back as to when they would be free. and unfortunately only four of them lined up together and two lined up at different times. *Well at least Ranginal will have some options.* So he scheduled the times for them to meet him in the gym. 

Work concluded, he turned his full attention to the conversation, but to be honest he was lost. Talking technical reports of a Shil’vati shuttle seemed impossible to comprehend without any frame of reference to the tech involved. *Hell, It’s like listening to Brits or Aussies talk about cricket.* Perhaps because the conversation was lost on him, he saw the two Navy gals who were at the edge of the hall talking animatedly back and forth to each other. What drew his attention more was that one of them he was sure was gesturing over toward their table before they began walking over with purpose. “Heads up, we got incoming.” Travis said to the table before reaching over to put his hand on Mel’Bae’s thigh. 

The two Sailors came over. “Hey, sorry to ask you this but can you settle a bet between me and my sister?” Said the one on the left. “I’m Tressa, and this dummy,” She jerked her thumb to the woman on her left. “Is my sister, Ba’dorne.” 

The other Shil’vati, turned to her sister and stuck her middle and index fingers up to her lips in a V shape. “Anyway, can we ask you and your husband a question?”

“What about?” Travis asked. speaking for himself “Something to do with Earth?”

“Well, sort of,” Tressa now addressed him directly. “We were wondering if you were *him*.” She turned her focus on Mel’bae. “You know if...well...if you two were them...the ones from the recording?”

“*Recording?!”* Travis said with a sinking feeling in his stomach. Mel’bae looked like she was about to turn blue from anger and embarrassment.”

“Yeah, we might be making more runs to Earth and we wanted to know if that’s how you get a man there?” Ba’dorne chimed in. “Cause...well you got him married to you, so *IS* that how Humans do it?”

“Listen you little shitstain….” Mel’bae started to stand up. but Travis patted her thigh and mouthed the words 

“*Keep your shirt on.”* 

He then turned to the two of them. “Do you have a copy of this recording?” He felt like he was going to start shaking any moment over what he may see. “

“Oh. Yeah!” Tressa volunteered. Handing over an omnipad under the glare of Mel’bae. Travis pressed play. 

And was instantly relieved.The video played, it was of a human male, similar height and hair color as him, but definitely not him. The man was in an alley with a Shil’vati marine, both of them clearly drunk and stumbling around while onlookers cheered and jeered them on. Then, with a burst of energy the man swung at the Marine. It shouldn’t have worked, but somehow he connected just underneath the chin, in what boxers call “the button.” In humans, it’s a spot that has a nerve bundle that if you hit, it causes the body’s nervous system to go haywire. Your legs no longer work, even if you are still fully conscious they just don’t work. Which, by the video, she clearly wasn’t. As the drunk man wandered off into the night, Travis remembered seeing this before. It was the famous *DRUNK DUDE PWNS PURP!* video that had circulated on the datanet for months.

“Sorry ladies, That’s not me. And I have no Idea who that guy is. I never saw him before in my life.” Travis said as the two sisters looked deflated. Mel’bae relaxed after seeing that it wasn’t them in the video.

“Then…” Ba’drone asked. “How *do* you get a human guy?” The look on their faces was almost pleading. *Well unless you got a time machine and can go back 7 years… it might be difficult.* Travis tried to keep from saying. These two looked like they were in grade school when the invasion happened.

“I wish I could tell you.” Mel’bae slid her arm over Travis’ shoulder, taking almost a big sister tone with the two. “But I don’t think there is a one size fits all answer. Though some general advice. Don’t treat them like precious fragile gemstones or like barbarian sex gods. Treat them like they are smart, capable individuals that you can relate to. and…” She winked over at Travis. “You need to let them know that tusks won’t get in the way down there.”

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

That night they laid together naked, after making love. Though, as they cuddled, Mel’bae continued to caress his body. She was usually asleep by this point of the night. *Either her stamina has increased or I’m losing a step.* He reflected. Either way though, It was still a great night. He leaned in to kiss her. “So, that was worrying. But it looks like we’re in the clear. Hopefully nobody has any recording of us.. well doing this.” Mel’bae draped her leg over his hips, he buried his head into the nape of her neck. 

“I need to confess something, Darling.” That got his attention. “It’s just that, if there really is a recording of us out there, I wish that bitch would just release it already.” Travis shifted his body to look into her eyes. He really had no clue what to say. “I fucking hate having this following us around. It’s like the enemy’s got the orbitals and we’re just waiting for the rods to drop. If it does exist and get out...” She caressed his cheek. “You, Darling, are at least going to look like some heroic sex god; I mean, Empress knows I don’t want my family to know what our sex life is like. Dad and my moms always tried to keep it quiet when we kids were in the house. And there I was, moaning and panting and slobbering all over you. I think I yelled out ‘I love you’ so loud they heard me back at the base.”

“I think they heard you that night back on Shil, you came so hard you broke the space-time continuum.” Her eyes got wide at that, but then they both began to laugh. “But it’s not the sex, well...not *just* the sex that would piss me off if there really is a recording. That night was the first time you told me you loved me, and I told you I loved you. Maybe it’s a dumb human thing but that is intimate. That’s *personal!”*

Mel’bae thought for a moment. “You know, for how different humans are from Shil’vati I sometimes forget how male you can be about some things, my Darling.” Travis wasn’t sure how to take that, but he assumed it had to do with his romantic streak.

“Want to know something else about how male I am?“ He said as he ran his hand up the leg draped over his hip to her left cheek and gave it a firm squeeze. “I get really turned on by all that moaning….and panting...and slobbering!”  

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_      

Travis walked into the C Deck gym and was hit in the face by the odor, the place smelled like a barn full of drying lilac blossoms. It wasn’t a *bad* smell for him, but damn they needed to ventilate this place better. He saw racks of weights and some machines that looked like home work out equipment. Searching he saw Herel and My’vern, the two marines he was going to practice with this hour. Ranginal hadn’t shown up yet but it was still about 15 minutes before the agreed upon time. 

Seeing him they both bowed to him and he bowed back before going up to each and fist bumping them. They began going through their beginning wrist stretches when Raginal walked in. The Rakiri was wearing standard workout clothes, obviously modified to fit for a tail. Travis waved, signaling to come over to the open area with the spongy floor that was usually used for sparring. “Hello Raginal, welcome. Since this is your first lesson, a couple of basics first. At the beginning of each class we bow to show respect. Usually there's a picture of the founder of Aikido in one area but since we’re borrowing the gym we’ll just face toward that wall.”  Travis pointed at the bulkhead to their right. They bowed together, somewhat awkwardly. Then Travis turned to all three of them and bowed to his students. The two marines bowed back, quickly followed by Raginal who was a little surprised by the call of “*Onegaishimasu*” the three said. To which Travis explained it was a standard greeting.

After that it was basic stretching. Something most Shil’vati never did and it showed. In the almost year he had been teaching on the base he had seen some improvement in the flexibility of the marines who trained with his Sensei, but they were still big, tall, muscled amazons so it was slow going. Then they began basic practice. Practicing the basic *kamae* stance of feet one shoulder width apart with one foot in the lead, toes pointed forward so that the hips and shoulders were square. *Tenkan* practice came next. Travis demonstrated how to turn, using the back foot to turn 180 degrees drawing a half moon shape with his foot. Next came paired practice.

Both Herel and My’vern were studying for their *4th Kyu* rank, or their greenbelt in Travis’ system. So they worked on a slightly more advanced technique than he would normally do for a beginner. “So as *Uke*, the attacker, comes in with a straight punch, you need to get off the line of attack.” Travis shifted his front foot over slightly. “Not by much, you want your partner to continue to throw their punch at where you were. Too much movement,” He shifted further over, “and they will follow you and connect with you. Now when their arm is extended, strike down with your arm. Then hit with your other forearm to the side of their neck. Pull the arm up and the head down, grab the arm with your hand, we call this the yolk. Then step forward and throw. We don’t have to do the throw part today, Rangial, but these two should.”

“I’m not sure I understand. What if they turn to swing at you with the other claw?” The Rakiri asked.

“Well if you’ve got proper *Kuzushi*, or breaking your partner's balance, then they shouldn’t be able to turn on you.” 

“May I see? Please demonstrate with me.” The grin on the Rakiri’s face was completely feral*. Great! My first class among the stars and I’ve already got someone challenging me. Well nothing for it, Just gotta let some folks learn the hard way.*

“Alright, so punch…” Raginal struck out with impressive speed. Travis barely had time to move let alone begin the technique, the blow missed, but was damn close but then the Rakiri was able to turn and threw a haymaker at his head. Travis ducked under the fist and slid to the back of the big furball. 

*STUPID! You’ve gotten complacent with how slow the Shil’vati are! Punk is going to take your head off.* Travis backed up to give himself room for when his opponent turned around. “You’re quicker than I thought.” Raginal commented.

“Do you want to get back to training or do we need to continue this pissing match?”

“Your species scents things too?” Raginal’s furry face seemed to contort in puzzlement.

*“*Well… Nevermind.” 

This time it was a kick. Travis sidestepped and blocked with his forearm bringing it up toward his face like a shield. The blow hurt but the angle allowed some of the momentum to bleed off. Travis used his other hand to grab the ankle and then he used his *tenkan* to turn 180 degrees spinning with himself in the center and his opponent on the outside. Once on the ground, Travis held the leg like a sword searching for and finally finding what he was looking for: the main nerve bundle in the leg and then he bared down on it. Hearing the Rakiri call out in pain, he looked to see the leg smeared with blood. Travis let go quickly. “Crap! You're bleeding!”

“Travis Sensei,” My’vern called out. “It’s your blood.” 

“What? Travis said, looking at himself. Sure enough his left forearm had two deep scratches in it from the kick he had blocked.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_    

“I’ll rip that bitches furry head clean off!” Mel’bae said quite coldly while holding Travis’s arm. They were back in their quarters after Travis got out of the medbay. The Medlab had simply put some wound sealant in the long scratches on the outside of his forearm. The bleeding had pretty much stopped even before they had made it to Medlab. That’s one reason to use the back of the arm to block. The inside has many, many veins and arteries close to the skin; which, if cut, can cause you to bleed out. Which is why it’s used for suicide.

“Honey. Don’t.“ Travis reasoned with her. “Look, sometimes people are going to challenge what I’m doing and I’m not going to win every match. Christ, nobody can! I can only do my best and train those who want to learn. I already talked it over with Ranginal in the sickbay, He wanted to see proof that the training I’m providing works. Tossing him down got Ranginal thinking about how he was trained to fight by his ‘war mistresses’. He was trained as a striker, therefore grappling is something he’s interested in learning. We bumped fists and called it a day. There’s no animosity between us. “Hell,” Travis grinned. “I’m not sure, but I think I made a new friend. And you can’t go around beating up guys just because I got injured while sparring.” 

Mel’bae looked at him and shook her head. “I can’t believe you can be so calm about… WAIT! HE? a guy?!”

“Yeah, Ranginal’s a male Rakiri.”

“How can you tell?”

“Well he’s either male, or she’s a flat chested female who had a sideline business smuggling goro fruit in her shorts. I worked at a lot of different bars over the years, Darling.” He slid his hand around her waist and smiled. “You pick a few things up.”

Posted with permission from u/BlueFishcake 

Groaning, I feel my eyes flick open, and I see light barely peeking through some kind of cloth covering my face. Blinking, I twist my head around, trying to see anything. Predictably, I can't.

Pulling on my wrists, I feel cold metal press against them, followed by the sound of clinking metal. Handcuffs, or chains. Pulling my legs, I can feel the same sensation. Captors are smart then.

Taking in a deep breath, I close my eyes, and rely on my other senses. I'm sitting on a cold metallic chair, in a small room, based on the echo when I tap my foot, with a boot, on the floor. I'm also shirtless, which is a bit odd. I'm not wounded, though I do have what is likely a hangover, based on both my headache and dry throat.

""Fuck's sake....."" I mutter, leaning back in the chair, and I feel it rock a tiny bit. So.....I'm not bolted to the ground. Good to know, I suppose.

I wait for a few minutes, just listening, trying to figure out why I'm here. I mean, I was a former soldier prior to the invasion, and even if I'm rebel sympathetic, I'm not technically one..........Did I do something last night?

As I sit, I hear a door slide open, followed by what sounds like two sets of footsteps. One pair gets exceptionally close, before the cloth over my head is ripped off, and I nearly go half-blind by the sudden change in brightness in combination with my hangover. Groaning, I slam my eyes, and slowly open them. 

When my vision recovers, I blink a few times, then narrow my eyes at the figure across from me.

A likely over 7 foot tall, purple skinned woman, built like a damn Amazonian warrior, dressed in a nearly skin-tight grey suit, with some kind of insignia that I haven't bothered to learn, nor do I care to. On the left side of her chest, several medals, and on her right, a kind of unit patch. Her hair, currently in a braid, is likely fairly long, like ever other fuckin Shil bitch that decided that Earth was gonna be their playground.

""Ky;yia insyia nagori intuish?"" The woman across from me asks, and I blink.

""I don't care to speak what the fuck that is, Purp."" I snarl, and she sighs, then puts a respirator of some kind over her mouth, presses a button, and speaks, this time, in English. 

""Hello, human. My name is 1st Lieutenant Lyia. To my understand, you are a fighter, correct?"" The soldier asks, and I sigh

""If you mean a soldier, yes. Otherwise, go fuck yourself."" I reply, barely keeping my tone even semi-clam. 

""Insulting us is not going to make your time here easier."" 

""Makes me feel better, though."" I reply, giving her a cheeky smile, which makes her narrow her eyes. 

""Right....now, let me explain something. You are under arrest for assaulting a Shil'Vati Marine Officer. A crime punishable by years of servitude to said officer."" She says, and I raise an eyebrow

""I assume something happened when I was drunk?  "" I mutter, and the Shil stares at me, unamused. 

""Outstanding awareness, human. Now, I'm going to show a video, and I need you to confirm that you are the one in this video."" The Shil says, flipping around a tablet-like device. On it is a still frame of who could only be me, shirtless, fists up, staring down a Shil who has at least 8 inches on me. Not that much, considering my 6'4"" frame. But, nonetheless as I watch, I proceed to beat the shit out of the Shil'Vati, eventually managing to break off of her tusks, holding it above my head like a trophy as the human in the bar cheer, hoisting their drinks in the air. I look down in the corner, and see the number of what I assume is views. 15 million. Posted a day ago. 

""Well.....looks like I kicked some Shil'Vati ass. Wasn't there someone who did that a few months back? Jason something or other?"" I ask, and the Lieutenant across from me simply narrows her eyes

""Unimportant. You assaulted, then severely injured Capitan Kygonia, and as such, put her in the infirmary. Now, human, at this point, you have three options."" Lyia sighs, setting the tablet aside, and looking at me, steepling her fingers and staring me down, which I gladly return. 

""Either you go to jail for about 6 Shil'Vati years, become the Capitan's servant for the same amount of time.........or you join the Shil'Vati Marines."" I'm struck silent by the words of the Lieutenant, and shake my head

""I must've heard you wrong. You said *join the Shil'Vati Marines?*"" I ask, and she nods

""Yes. Jason, the human you mentioned, also joined the Marines. He was not a soldier. You are, are you not?"" She asks, and I sigh

""I was, technically, but yes. Your point?"" I snarl, and she looks over at her tablet-thingy, swiping a few times. 

""Here you are. Caleb Rasta. 26 years old, former member of the 101st 'Screaming Eagles'. Given high marks by superiors. An excellent long-range weapons specialist, according to this. Completed four combat jumps in the 4th war of Yemen. Impressive."" The Shil says, looking at me, and I stare back. 

""Your point? I'm not all that special, you know. There are thousands of veterans with much more experience and training than me. I'm not worth that much to you."" I reply, and she humms. 

""Usually, yes. But this is what has interested my superiors. Participated in Operation Black Night."" She says, and I feel my blood run ice-cold. 

""How the fuck do you know about that?"" I snarl, straining on my cuffs, and the Lieutenant merely raises an eyebrow, succeeding in pissing me off more. 

""We know everything about what your military has done. Anyway, you are no stranger to.....well, less than legal missions, right? That's why we want you. You are willing to get your hands bloody for a cause."" I grit my teeth at that. 

""One I'm willing to fight for, Shil. I'm not willing to fight for an empire which....what was the term you people used? Oh, right, 'liberated' my fucking planet. Not here to do that. I swore an oath to uphold the US constitution, and nothing else. I'm not a mercenary, so good fucking luck getting me to do shit for you bitches."" I growl, and she hums. 

""Right. So, would you rather rot in prison, or be a servant?"" She asks, and I close my eyes. 

""...........If I became a soldier, how long would I be in?"" I sigh, regretting doing this already. 

""3 years, minimum. That's Shil'Vati years. Roughly translates to 5 human years."" Lyia replies

""..........Fuck's sake......"" I mutter, thinking about it. Either 5 years fighting for a military I don't like, or being in prison/a servant for twice that long. Sell my soul to the devil, or rot?

"".....I'll become a Marine."" I finally sigh, and the Lieutenant smiles

""Alright then. Now, you have to si-"" 

""Under two conditions."" I interrupt Lyia, who stares at me, an eyebrow raised

""You're not in a position to make demands, human."" She growls quietly, and I raise an eyebrow. 

""Yeah, but I'm making them. First: I will not kill any human unless they threaten my own life. Second, I want kinetic weapons. Other than that, I have very little issue with however you see fit to run things, if I'm actually going to be in combat."" I reply, and she narrows her eyes

""No killing your own species, and you want inferior weapons compared to plasma?"" She asks, incredulous. 

""I'm not in the business of killing civilians, human or otherwise. And my 'inferior' weapons, as you put it, are what I'm used too. Besides, I'm a sniper. I kinda need consistency, as much as I can get it. I'm not going to spend months learning a new weapon, when I can get back into the swing of things in a matter of days or weeks. Besides, the weapon I want to use, even if it can't instantly kill a Shil in armor, will certainly do some damn damage. Because a .338 AP round will fuck you over. I've done it."" I reply, my tone quiet and calm. 

"".......Where do you intend to get your kinetic weaponry?"" Lyia asks, and I shrug. 

""I have both weapons and ammo at my house. I'm gonna need a lot more if I'm going to be serving militarily, but the stuff I have will last me a decent bit."" I reply, and she narrows her eyes

""All weapons were supposed to be turned in to the Empire a while back, human."" She notes, and I shrug

""I wasn't going to hand over my weapons so easily. I'm American, our weaponry might as well be our religion. Besides, its not all that much. Two rifles, two pistols, and a shit-ton of ammo."" I reply, scratching the back of my head. 

""Two rifles. What kinds?"" She asks, and I sigh. 

""One is a bolt-action chambered in .338 Lapua Mag, known as the Savage Arms 100BA. Basically, it's my long range 'civilian model' rifle. It was cheaper than my service rifle, so I bought it. But, post-invasion, I managed to sneak home my service rifle. Namely, the Barret MRAD. This is a bit more adaptable, so it's nicer for military engagements."" I reply, and Lyia looks at me

""You have two high-caliber rifles, one military grade, if I'm correct?"" I simply shrug in reply. 

""So what? Self-defense, protection against government tyrrany, all that jazz. Look, I'm gonna want my weapons. I'm a damn good shot with them, better than any soldier in your damn army, and I am willing to bet money that. Point is, I'm keeping them."" I say, and the Lieutenant sighs. 

""It would have to be approved by my superiors, but it can be done. So....will you join?"" She asks, and I sigh. 

""It's the best out of three bad options, so yes. I'll join your little squad, but I have one more thing to add. I am *not* a fucking sex toy."" I say, and the Lieutenant laughs. 

""Oh, I'm not even a part of it. I'm just the messenger, so to speak. By the way, you will have other humans with you. It's going to be an even split of humans and Shil'Vati. Six of each. I wish you luck, Mr. Rasta. Welcome to the Reapers."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Apparently Shil'Vati have a sense of humor.

**San Francisco, California. 11:30 am , Intergalactic Knowledge and Trade Education Center. 2046**

Finlay P. Roberts Paced outside of his future test Kitchen, 15 minutes until it was his turn and he deeply regretted coming in early. 9th in line and he had watched 7 of his 8 predecessors storm out of the room with looks of frustration, tears and just general shitty moods. Whatever was going on in there, it had to be infuriating, 2 of his fellow young cooks had sworn off going for the second exam as they left and upon asking what just happened his only answer back was. \*""NDA, can't tell you... some pure bullshit though...""\*

Which did nothing but fuel his imagination, Were they expected to name some off-planet dishes? A cooking battle against an Alien chef seemed exciting... If not a bit soul crushing. It's only been 3 years since 1st contact, and it'd be another 5 before off-planet ingredients would be available to the public according to the News. Something about cross-species viability testing, his best guess was they were still figuring out what could be eaten by humans safely and what Human foods and Ingredients could be safely eaten for themselves. That was Half the reason he was here, he wanted to go and be apart of the Culinary research team on one of the super-stations. A pioneer in his field AND a free trip to space? Who'd pass up on that?

Apparently student 8 would, fleeing from the kitchen in a Furious manner. Looking to Finlay with little more than a ""Good Fucking Luck Dude."" before continuing to leave.

""Chef Roberts?"" a Mantis-like Alien with a feminine voice set auto-translator peeked out of the Kitchen, Compound eyes didn't really tell him where she was looking, but his gut said they were focused on him.

""I-uh, I wouldn't call myself a Chef, no major accolades and all that, just a decent cook.""

""I see, sorry for the mistake. As you no doubt Noticed, the kitchen is available early. Would you mind waiting just a few moments while the room is reset?""

""Not at all... I think I might be last examinee for today anyway..."" looking back at some of the other Cooks, some were already packing it in... The anger from their fellow aspiring chefs, those who had been the most confident, who had also presumably failed, brought down morale.

""Lovely! You may address me as Chef Ziq'drie. I'll be your Proctor. I'll call for you when the test is ready."" The compound eyes vanishing back into the Kitchen, the noise of metal clattering already sounding out.

...She... they? Whatever they were, they seemed friendly enough, if not a little shy. He turned to his other cooks, stressed faces looking at their Holo-Companions. Some idly petting them as they reconsidered their futures. His own Holo-Companion flitting around their head scanning him and sending information on his elevated heart rate. As cute as it was, the rapid movements were not helping... tapping the frame of his glasses he called for the hard-light creature to enter Idle mode.

Another gift from the intergalactic Union, Holo-companions had basically replaced smartphones, acted as translation devices and to some a Viable replacement for flesh and blood pets. With a small implant at the temple and a choice of external input devices. Anything from general voice input to wedding rings now... They were handy and did their job, think of them as a support animal. Each taking the form of ones favorite animal from their Home planet. Finlay's was a Doctor-Bird, the National Bird of Jamaica. *Hummingbirds are cool.*

Moments later and Finlay stood at the counter admiring the space-kitchen, it was hard to all it anything else... everything was so sleek and clean. and their were some things he couldn't recognize right away, there were 2 stove-top ovens, a Salamander, smoker, some large sous vide set-up, and 2 high-grade 3D-printers for some reason.  A screen on the far wall was scrolling his volunteered information for his Proctor to read over, which he followed along with until he was told to begin.

* ROBERTS, FINLAY P.
* Age: 23
* Nationality: Human, Jamaican-American dual citizenship, Earth Born
* Eye color- Flecked hazel
* Hair : Black, Tight soft curls
* Skin tone: *Blonde caramel* (Inquire.)
* 7 years Culinary Experience
* Projected Chance of Passing exam: 12%

*""Well, that doesn't look good for me.""*

""Mr. Roberts, I've been asked to Inquire about your described Skin-tone. If you're comfortable sharing that information.""

""I'm surprised you guys actually took that as an answer... it's an Inside joke between me and my Mom. I'm Blonde Caramel since I'm so sweet... she told me to put that as my answer.""

""Familial Bonds are a wonderful thing, Might I also ask what your middle initial stands for?""

""I... would prefer if you didn't. Just a personal preference, I got teased a lot in my younger years for it.""

""Understood. Lastly before we begin, Shall we Compare Holo-Companions?"" The mantis-like Alien Clapping their scythes together as the Hellspawn of a porqupine and a Python, appeared around their neck like a scarf. ""My kind the Kre'tee Call this creature an Ebera-ta, they're Quite delicious when Steamed.""

""Oh... Very...very cool."" Swallowing his own fear of snakes down he called for his Holo-companion to come-out, the small bird flitting about with it's long tails swishing behind. ""This is a Variant of Humming-bird. They aren't usually consumed... if at all."" growing silent as the Alien chittered excitedly.

""It's an adorable specimen! a Much needed break from all of the predator Holo's I've seen today!""

""I know, Right!? So many Big cats and wolves around. It's nice to see something peaceful.""

The two spent a few more minutes talking about some of the wackier Holo's they've both seen. Chef Ziq'drie was elated that there was apparently a small creature resembling her own people, claiming that she'll have to collect a specimen to send to her homeworld. Though as the time for Finlay's test approached, she had to abruptly end the conversation and explain what the exam would be.

""While you may be very familiar with your Home world's cuisine. Joining The Intergalactic Culinary Research team will pit you against a great many you'd never have imagined, many of which I still haven't seen myself... Today you will be given a Fulgan Ingredient."" Placing what Looked to Finlay like a shimmering purple bowling ball, in front of him on the Counter. ""The Grandurr, infamous for infuriating new Chefs. This Exam will test your problem solving ability... I should warn you. Don't use any precious Family tools. You may ask questions, but I of course can not give you the solution. You may use anything inside this test kitchen to your advantage. Your objective is to collect the Liquid inside with as little waste as possible. You have 15 minutes... Begin.""

""OH! shit, okay."" Finlay picked up the grandurr, giving an experimental shake... he could feel the liquid slosh around... Alien coconut... or egg... one of the two. Time to use those questions then.

""Is this Grown or Laid by another creature?""

""Grown, I believe your people refer to it as a type of Fruit.""

""...Eeeh... are the contents flammable or under pressure?""

""To an open flame it may light, but is quite resilient to heat. It is not under pressure.""

""......Last question. Those 3D Printers... what are they for?""

""Hm? well, one is for the Production of Synth-meats. Not very efficient to have entire farms while traveling in space. The other is Tool manufacture. While experimenting with new ingredients, you may hit a roadblock... though it is set to only produce tools from this planet at the moment.""

""...Holy shit, I think I got it."" That was supposed to be an Inward thought, but he was surprised at the connections he had made on his own. In the flow of the moment he spun the grandurr in his palms looking for any kind of weak point, and finding none. he  rapped his knuckles on the shell listening to the sounds it made... it was Almost metallic, whatever material this thing was made of, it was hard as hell, but thin like grape skin. ""Spec, pull up 3D Print schematic of a Soldering Iron... High grade.""

Walking over to the Tool Printer, his Holo sent the schematic and it was chugging away, producing said tool. Going by the silence of the Kre'tee he was either on the right track... or off by several Country miles. Snatching the tool as soon as the machine signaled it's completion, he picked up a large mixing bowl and ran it over to the Counter. Putting the Grandurr inside. he plugged the Soldering iron into the over-head outlet and pressed the tip to the Fruit, slowly cranking up the heat.

""... Correct me if I'm wrong Mr. Roberts. but isn't that tool meant for use in Electronics production?""

""You're spot on actually... it also makes for a great Burn tip if you're trying to engrave something on wood."" Slowly twisting the handle in his hands as he worked, he could almost see the thin skin warp under the tools heat. ""But, Since you told me not to use any precious Family tools... that told me normal means of puncture were going to be useless.. had to think outside the Box- er, Kitchen."" With a stratifying Lurch, he felt the tip sink into the fruit and spun it around so the hole started to drain the milky contents, then reapply the too to form another hole, lifting it up to watch as the Grandurr drained into the mixing bowl. ""FUCK YEAH!.... sorry.""

""No Worries Chef Finlay... Congratulations on Passing the Test in... 3 minutes and 12 seconds. It wasn't the fastest time Terra-wide... but it's safe to say you got the most out of the Grandurr."" He couldn't tell if Chef Ziq'drie was Smiling, but he damn sure felt proud.

""...I hope you don't mind my asking, but how many have passed this test terra wide so far?""

""186 thousand Humans, Your Species has broken the record for most passes in the Intergalactic Union... for the first round at least.""

""Awesome!"" Shaking the last few droplets out, he rolled the empty husk to the sink... well, fuck it. May as well taste of his prize. Taking a hanging Ladle down to dip into the liquid and bringing it to his Mouth.

""Finlay, I would-""

""***PBBBBBBTH!""*** Spitting out most of liquid he set off into a loud and desperate coughing fit. Bringing his head under the tap and washing his mouth out. it had to have been the most SOUR thing he had ever tasted, he could feel his body shudder under the invasive fluid, and that wasn't even enough to stop the alcoholic burn. An Evil Citrus Vodka.

""I should have warned you earlier... this fruit is usually diluted..""

He spent the rest of his remaining test time gargling out the sour taste before stumbling out of the exam room, sending most of the remaining students into a panic. Wondering what the hell had happened to him now. Seeing the quizzical looks on his peers faces. He could only manage a thumbs up and a croaked ""I passed..."" The warmth of the alcohol already working his way through his body, continued to stumble past the other. Most of them giving him pats on the back or cheering him on for clearing the first test. Their own spirits reignited as they saw it was possible.

=================================================================================

HI, Me again! I hope you enjoyed this silly thing. If you did, let me know in the comments. Right now, I feel like I could have done much more justice to the description of Chef Ziq'drie. If you guys want more of these silly little chef adventures, I'm more than happy to write it up. I left some things Intentionally Vague here on purpose, incase I stepped on toes by accident and it may be subject to light retcon in the future.

In case someone wants to invite me to write in their (Universe?) *\*Cough\**  I'm still pretty new here, I may not know all of the head cannons. I'll say it now,  I'm not one of the greats. Undoubtedly there are run-on sentences, Incorrect capitals, and just good ole' bad grammar.",/r/HFY/comments/nzibdt/intergalactic_culinary_research_preliminary_exam_1/,41
30,nzmia9,HFY,Mon Jun 14 16:13:43 2021,The Terran Mercenaries [Chapter 1],"# Chapter 1: The four musketeers

**Synopsis: Four human intergalactic mercenaries contracted by a human private military contractor known as Deathworlder. They arrive on an alien world inhabited by deer people, or Roalans. They do not know the details of their job, just that they have government permits to operate their own kinetic firearms. This is their first ever mercenary contract.**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Sun Tzu, Clausewitz, Stonewall and Zhukov stepped out onto the platform of the spaceport. The four humans walked together in unison, their footsteps making a dull thump. They manoeuvred their way towards the immigration area, preparing to get through immigration services.

They got into line, guarded by security officers and aliens much taller than they were. Humanity was the newest species on the intergalactic scene, being a rare sight outside their solar system. Many aliens stared at them, having never seen humans before.

Clausewitz looked around, he was a german standing at 6’2, with blonde hair and blue eyes, he was the stereotypical german propaganda boy you’d see in propaganda posters of the third Reich.

His eyes locked with an alien child standing in line, the little kid looked like a small deer from Terra, its wide eyes gazing curiously at the rarely seen creature.

He smiled at the little boy, causing the child to duck away, probably due to nervousness or embarrassment. He sighed, looking at his 3 compatriots as they shuffled slowly to the immigration officers tables, waiting to be processed.

Stonewall was a gruff American, looking very similar to Vin Diesel in one of those old 3rd-millennium Terran action flicks, standing at 6’1.

“What’s wrong?” Zhukov asked, tilting his head slightly to face Clausewitz

Zhukov was the shortest of the group, standing at 5’10. He had an uncanny resemblance to 3rd millennium actor Vladimir Mashkov.

“Nothing, it’s just that the processing is taking fucking forever,” said Clausewitz, with a thick German accent as he spoke Terran standard otherwise known as, english.

“It sure is a fucking pain in the ass.” Sun Tzu spoke from the rear, “Can these fucking deer hurry up and get shit done already.”

Sun Tzu was the tallest of the group, standing at 6'5. He looked like a Chinese Olympic weightlifter from the 3rd millennium, with a clean-shaven face and square jaw.

“Patience.” Clausewitz muttered. A few of the alien species swivelled their heads to look at the humans converse in Terran standard, “Just give it another hour or two.”

Sun Tzu sighed, rolling his eyes as they managed to get processed one by one.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

After the four humans were processed by a deer person or Roalan, who had stared at them with curiosity during the whole process. They went to the “I have something to declare” section of immigration.

The four approached the immigration officer sitting at his desk, with two security guards posted next to him.

“Yes?” The guard looked up, a very tall male, with brown fur and wide eyes, looking at the four humans.

“We’ve got permits for Class 4 weapons and a security contractors permit,” Clausewitz said in galactic standard, handing over their permits.

“One moment please.” the immigration officer spoke, before conversing in their specific language with the security guards.

“You’re going to have to wait for a second, we are reviewing the permits for potential forgeries, please wait.” the security guard spoke as the immigration officer hurried off to get the permits checked.

Sun Tzu groaned, slapping his palm against his forehead, “Are you fucking serious.”

“Yes, I am.” said the security guard, towering over the humans as it stood at 7’3. “Do not attempt to escape. Stand still and wait.”

The four humans stood around for about \[10 minutes\], as the immigration officer hurried back.

“Everything checks out, you may go, please follow the guards as they escort you to your luggage.”

The four sighed, as the guards signalled for them to follow. Clausewitz glanced down, looking at the weapons the guard had. It was a long and unwieldy weapon, for a human.

It was colored blue and had a curved pistol grip. It looked like a blue metal tube with a stock and pistol grip. The barrel was narrow but tall, with basic iron sights attached to the weapon.

The RSR-31, the standard plasma rifle of the Roalan unitarian republic, Clausewitz mused. He had read about it when researching the standard equipment of the government. Slow firing plasma, relatively silent compared to kinetic weaponry, causes severe burns when it lands on someone. Neat gun, the main drawback is that, if the battery malfunctions or a bit of dirt gets inside it, kaboom.

The german chuckled to himself, getting a look from one of the guards as they approached the “I have something to declare” section of immigration. Their equipment was already removed from the rotating carousel.

Their firearms, armor and ammunition were removed and placed on a steel bench, being examined by an immigration officer with additional security guards. It seems that they were on edge, Clausewitz noticed the increased security presence, with a total of 8 armed guards securing the area.

“Class 4 weapons permit and security contractors permit, correct?” The immigration officer said, this time a female Roalan standing at 6’8, still taller than the humans, but shorter than the male armed guards.

“Yes, can we go now?’ Sun Tzu interjected, being impatient

“Get out of my sight.” the roalan said with a hint of distaste in her face, obviously not wanting to deal with the deathworlders.

“Thank you, come on boys,” Clausewitz spoke, as Sun Tzu’s eyes widened, obviously wanting to insult the female Roalan. Clausewitz gave Sun Tzu a sideways glance and shook his head slightly. Sun Tzu sighed, relenting as he started packing up his gear.

As everyone had packed up their equipment, returning them to their firearm cases and donning their armor. They walked towards the exit of the space port.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Everyone stared, as the four humans, carrying firearm cases and rucksacks walked out of the spaceport. They were occasionally hassled by security officers, but a flash of the class 4 weapons permit staved off any issues.

The 4 mercenaries headed to their contact, having been informed to walk a few \[metres\] to the right of the exit, to where a luxury limousine was waiting for them. Clausewitz sighed, knocking on the window, as the window slid down, revealing a male Roalan chauffeur in a fancy green and red-robed outfit, similar to a Japanese yukata.

“Ah, the deathworlders, we’ve been expecting you.”

Clausewitz rolled his eyes, “Yes, yes, can we come in?”

The chauffeur nodded, pressing a button on the dashboard as the doors slid upward, the doors being atop the fancy limousine. All four of them clambered inside, sitting in the interior of the large limousine.

As the vehicle was designed for Roalans, there was much more space for the humans to sit and stretch their legs, the interior was more akin to a luxury seating area, with two sofas on each end. There was a large metal table in the middle and seating on the tables, obviously, this was used to conduct business meetings.

The interior was lined with fridges tucked beneath the sofas and cabinets sealed with a passcode. All four of them clambered inside and sat on the sofas, being wide enough to accommodate all four of them.

The doors shut with a quiet hiss, as the vehicle began to drive off. The metal plating behind the sofa opened, with no sound, revealing the Roalan chauffeur as they began driving down towards the city on the alien planet.

“Welcome to Roalan prime gentlemen! Everything you need to know will be in here.” the chauffeur reached under his dashboard, pulling out two omnislates, which were futuristic I-pads of sorts, all information you need will be on them, containing the details of your job and your living quarters. If you need anything please let me know, refreshments are in the cabinets under the sofas, the passcode is 55555.”

Clausewitz looked down at the Omnislate, as it was translated into Terran standard or English for ease of reading, glancing down at the section where it said job description, his eyes widened.

*Job description: Protection of VIP, CEO of Larquian Industries. The potential danger, high. VIP’s life has been threatened on multiple occasions by criminal organisations. Accompany VIP for the duration of three standard galactic months. Food, housing, accommodation is paid for.*

Clausewitz looked at the other three humans, as they were reading the omnislate, “Well then, guess this will be our first job, working for Deathworlder.”

A wide grin appearing on the German’s face, as his crew would embark on their first security contract as intergalactic mercenaries.

Chapter 11: Losing Control

&amp;#x200B;

This week seemed to be a rather easy one for the various training cadres. This week’s training schedule consisted of testing and body sparring. The former is what the humans were having the most difficulty with, but that was relative. Most of what they were studying, such as rank structure, customs and courtesies, and history of the Shil’vati Marines, were what they spent nearly every free moment doing. A few of the Shil’vati had even offered to help, although only two of them were accepted. The others had “offered'' help in exchange for “help” with other matters. You didn’t need xray vision to see what they meant by that.

In the end, Kadra Mithis, the only male Shil’vati in the squad bay, and Trissila, who was very obviously not interested in men, were the ones who were helping the humans with their knowledge. The three humans and two Shil’vati sat in a corner in their squad bay, going over important facts and historical events, which Kadra was happily going on and on about. Say what you want about him at any other time, he had a passion for this stuff.

“And thus, that’s how the Shil’vati Marines emulate its ancient predecessors, the Colcari Legions, to this day.” He finished, a wide smile on his face. It was about half an hour or so before lights out, and they had spent the first hour doing nothing but quizzing each other.

“You have no idea how much we appreciate this, both of you!” White said with sincerity, a sentiment echoed by Novikov, who only nodded his head in agreement. The Russian rarely talked, and he rarely smiled, but this time he allowed the latter. The man had many reasons to hate the Shil’vati. Being the only survivor of his tank company during the Invasion, didn’t give him many reasons to like them. But he didn’t hate the two they sat with.

“Its not a problem at all,” Trissila replied. “I’m just glad you are willing to talk to anyone, even if only the two of us.”

“Yeah, well, blame the horny bitches who keep trying to bug us for sex every five fucking minutes.” Zachary said in annoyance. “To be honest, I'm surprised you haven’t made a pass on any of us yet.”

“If you can’t tell, I don’t particularly like men, no offense.”

“None taken.”

“Your women though,” She said, her tongue slithering out of her mouth to wet her lips. “I wouldn’t mind showing them just how useful a long tongue can be in a bedroom.”

“Which one?” White inquired. “There are two of them in the training company.”

“Pale one or dark one, I wouldn’t care which, both are very hot.” She said unabashed. Not that he didn’t agree with her on that score. A Finnish Army Reservist who escaped the worst of the fighting, and a Kenyan Wildlife Ranger. The former escaped getting profiled by the Shil’vati, and had very obviously gotten up to less than legal activities post war. The latter wasn’t taken as anything serious by the Shils, so they labeled her a civilian. Of the 15 humans present, only 4 were outright civilians, the rest were former military and law enforcement. Thanks to governments the world over wiping what data they could though, only seven of them, Zachary included, were listed as such.

“I say you’ve got good taste, but I wouldn’t count on either one of them fucking you.” White said bluntly.

“Yeah, I’m not sure if you’ve noticed, but most of us humans aren’t fans of you people. Constantly bugging us for sex isn’t doing anything to help that either.” Zachary told her. Trisilla just sighed and shrugged.

“I know, and some of us have started picking up on that. Some are still hoping to get lucky, but many are starting to give up. I understand how you feel though, its not a secret that most of you have experience with this type of work.” She said uneasily. “Former military?” All three of them nodded at the same time. “I’m sorry.” She said sincerely.

“Nothing can be done about it now.” Novikov said, before getting up, and going to his bunk.

“So why did any of you join in the first place? You hate us, don’t you?” She asked, genuinely curious.

“Not like we have anything going for us back home.” Zachary said as he got up, and went over to his bunk, where Kadra had decided to park himself at. Not surprising, given the lithe male was his rackmate. “Besides, this is something we’re good at. Maybe we’ll go see a warzone and get to shoot at something. Or maybe we’ll just fucking die.” He finished, getting up and going back to his bunk.

For the first few minutes, everything was relatively quiet. He was able to read his book in peace, the other humans in the squad bay had been left alone, the various females were sulking at the lack of attention they had been given, and Kadra was fiddling around in his bag for something he couldn’t see. Then the noise stopped, and Kadra dropped from his bunk and sat next to his. Normally he didn’t pay that any mind, but his next words would change that.

""Do human men have sex with other men?"" Kadra asked, forcing Zachary to snap his head up from the book he was reading, and look over at the Shil'vati male.

""Where the fuck did that come from?"" He said, not expecting to be asked such a question.

""It's something I heard about human men. That you're even allowed to marry another guy if you want."" He paused shortly before continuing. ""It's not true, is it? All the rumors about Earth and it's just another lie, isn't it?"" He asked, some disappointed in his voice as he took Zachary's facial expression of surprise to be that of disgust.

""No, it's not a rumor, men can get married to each other back on Earth."" He told Kadra, watching his face shifting to what he could best describe as relieved relaxation.. ""Most people outside of conservative religious groups don't give a damn. Why are you asking me that question though?""

""Well I just assumed that because of your comments from earlier..."" He left the words up in the air, allowing Zachary to figure out what he was talking about.

""So you're asking me because I've been with other men?"" Zachary asked, watching as the purple male's head slowly nodded up and down. ""And because of my comments towards my preference, which you heard?"" Again, the Shil'vati nodded his head, only now his face began turning blue as he did so.

“Well like I said, it's allowed and most of us don’t care.” This time, he leaned in closer to make sure the various eavesdroppers didn’t hear it. “And I know how it is in your society. There’s nothing wrong with you, and never let anyone tell you as much. It's nothing to be ashamed of.” With that, he went back to his book, and the Shil’vati male just nodded his head, and jumped back up to his bunk, and stared at the ceiling in contemplation.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

He dodged and weaved in the ring. He'd downed 2 of his 3 opponents so far, the other match was called to an end because the other recruit could barely keep her arms up. But he was fighting someone with a bit more skill. Seeing the human still not tired after 3 straight rounds, back to back, the instructors got creative. They sent one of their own in the ring to fight him. It was certainly an experience, and he was partly intimidated, but as he soon learned, even the mighty Shil'vati DI's had poorer reactions than a human. It didn't stop her from landing hits, but those hits didn't stop him.

""It seems you humans really are tenacious."" Drill Instructor Ka'Varik said as she swung once more at the human, who simply parried the blow. ""You don't know when to quit. To realize when you're beaten. Even after how many of you fell in a single day to our might, you still seem convinced of your victory.""

""This talk is pointless, Drill Instructor."" He said in as deadpan a manner as he could, hiding his frustration.

""Is it now? Just like how pointless it is for your people to keep resisting, even after we brought peace to your world?"" She said with an evil grin that he wanted so badly to tear from her face. ""I guess you were a smart one, after what I read in your file.""

""My file, Drill Instructor?"" He said, a bit curious of what she was referring to. And how the Shil'vati equivalent of a Kill Hat had read it.

""Of who you are and what you did before stepping foot on The Citadel. How you were smart enough to surrender on that miserable little island. It's a shame most of your kind don't have that intelligence."" She paused for a few moments, obviously needing to catch her breath, but also to study Zachary's form. She was aggravated at the human's tendency to dance around her, dodging her hits, and the fact that he continued to fight.

""But you aren't the first species to have no common sense, and keep fighting when all is lost. You are aware of the Roaches, are you not?""

""Yes, Drill Instructor."" He responded as he ducked under another of her blows, and delivered one of his own to her kidney, something she felt very well.

""Then you know what we do to those who won't fall in line. No matter how hard they hit, we hit them back harder. It was our solution to the Roach problem."" Zachary's eyes widened slightly as he started to pick up on what she was alluding to. He hoped he was just being paranoid, that he was misunderstanding her. But her next words proved that to be wrong. ""Our final solution.""

His fists tightened as he felt rage coursing through his body. His vision focused solely on her, blocking out everything else. Not a single sound except her sadistic chuckle reverberated in his head. His vision turned red, the rage built up in his body breaking free like water from a busted dam. He lunged.

She thought she had gotten what she wanted. She thought he’d finally take her head on and give her the chance to pummel him down. He was quick on his feet, and surprisingly strong as well. Too strong, she thought as the human plowed through her legs, taking advantage of her high center of gravity, gripping the back of her thighs, and bowled her over. She flipped backward once, and landed hard on the mat. She tried to recover and catch her breath, but that wasn’t going to happen.

Zachary landed *Hard* on her stomach with his knee, knocking what little wind she had left, out of her. Before she realized it, a fist slammed into her face, sending her skull to crack against the sparring ring’s softish floor. One hand grabbed her hair, the other continued its unrelenting assault against her face. She bawled her own fist and sent an upward right into his face. He didn’t fall back from it.

She punched again, and went for a third, but he released his grip on her hair, and caught her fist. He twisted her arm, and using his other, slammed down with enough force on it to break it, the sickening crack heard throughout the sparring chamber. Recruits and Marine personnel looked on in stunned horror at what was going on before them. As she looked back up, fear in her eyes, the human brought his elbow to connect with her jaw.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With adrenaline pumping through his veins, he didn’t feel a fucking thing. All he could feel was rage coursing through every fiber of his being at what she had said to him. The only thing on his mind was how to beat this sadistic bitch down. She wanted a fight, and by God he was going to give her one. All the frustration of the last 6 years had come to a boil, and he finally found a legitimate target for it.

After she was on her back, he slammed a knee into her stomach, and began assailing her. She had done her best to fight back, landing two very hard blows against his face, which due to adrenaline, he didn’t feel. However, he didn’t feel like letting her continue to hit him, so he caught her arm, twisted, and broke it. A loud snap echoing through the chamber. He saw real fear in her eyes as she cried out from the broken limb, and he cocked back his arm, and delivered his right elbow into her face, causing a sickening crunch as her nose broke.

Blood leaked profusely from his nose, his knuckles were cut to hell and gone from the continuous punches, and well as striking her tusks. As he delivered another elbow strike, her left tusk flew from her face, and went towards the crowd of recruits that had gathered. While he didn’t see it, one of them pocketed it as soon as they saw it.

The story of his family’s fucking hardships for over a century. The Irish being lazy drunkards and Jews being greedy bankers who ran the world. Those stereotypes being the most common regarding those of which his ancestors were part of. Now it was because he was human. All because humanity had refused to bend the knee to the Shil’vati. Because they fought hard ever since the day they arrived. They expected humanity to be meek and roll over. They were disappointed with the results.

“Final solution, huh?” He growled as he grabbed her by the throat. “Maybe you didn’t pay enough attention to our history, because those who said those words, *Lost!*” He raised his fist back once more, only to feel multiple pairs of hands gripping both of his arms, as well as torso, and around his neck. He resisted and slammed his head back, a crack sounded from behind, the Shil’vati crying out in pain at her broken nose. He broke one arm free, and tried to continue where he left off, but more and more people grabbed onto him.

Before long, at least half of the humans, as well as two medical Marines had finally restrained him on the ground, while others attended to the now beaten and bloodied Drill Instructor, or looked on with fascination and horror at Zachary.

“Calm the fuck down, mate! Its over!” He heard White screaming at him as the Australian held his right arm down.

“Calm down son, she’s had enough!” Fisher said. Novikov, White, Fisher, the Gurkha, the Finn, and the Maori recruit, all held him down as medics injected him with something to knock him out. The adrenaline in his system made it a difficult task, but the medics managed to do the job, and within a minute, he finally passed out.",/r/HFY/comments/nzq8z0/semper_shilvati_an_ssbverse_story_chapter_11/,106

———-

Artemis dressed In a black long sleeved shirt and pants. waited in a shadow, waiting for the current mass of those weird ass tech worshippers to finish up. They stuck around for conversation and to speak to that priest of theirs.

Once everyone one cleared out Artemis’s stepped out of the shadows. 

He noticed Artemis. “Oh, I haven’t seen you there.” Father Heddi said. Raising his weasel like head. “What brings the good woman here?”

“We need to talk.” Artemis said. The. Gestures to a door. “In private.”

Artemis found out that this priest works on those drones. She suspects that he was a lead mechanic or a specialist of some sort before receiving “holy implants”. All she has to do is access them.

They entered a private room. Artemis closed the door quietly.

“So what is it you want to say?” Father Heddi asked. “Confession?”

“No.” Artemis said staring into his glowing green eyes. Cybernetics definitely. “What I’m here is to find out what you are really.” 

His eyes widened as Artemis showed her left hand, black and silver cables extended from her palm. Jamming suites active so no distress signal gets sent out.

“Now I would like to know what’s in those implants of yours.” Artemis said quietly. 

“W-why?” Father Heddi said. “What does a humble follower of the machine mother would be able to give? The machine mother’s iron angels will defeat you if you lay a finger on me!”

“Do not resist.” Is all Artemis said.

He tried to run to the door. But Artemis is far faster. She grabbed him by his bronze coller? Shoulder pads? and threw him face first into the ground.

She swiftly grabbed his wrists in one hand. Damn he’s flexible. She placed a knee on his hip and applied her weight. “As I said. Do not resist. Do not shout. And hold still.”

Artemis brought her left hand to the back of his neck. At this point he is whimpering in fear. The cables cut away the fur with self cleaning scalpel scissors to reveal a brown mottled skin with a barely visible scar. 

Artemis injects an anesthetic to numb the area then makes a small incision. They opened up the cut to reveal some. What, a standard Mk-49 implant adapter port? The fuck? She reads the serial number on it.

“Where the fuck did you get human implants?” Artemis asked tersely.

“T-the emissary gave it to me!” The priest said, tears rolling from his eyes.

Artemis plugs in. Now let’s see. The fuck? This is basic code, far more encrypted but. The fuck?

These implants are in Artemis’s database. So she knows the ins and outs. Let’s see. Ha! She hits a fire wall.

[this is an agent of the machine mother. I demand you stop.]

Huh. [listen here mother fucker. I have put up with enough shit to last a red dwarf’s lifetime. I have been sent here to bring a kid back. I know you work for Loki. Now let me get the location of your closest handler.] Artemis sent.

[I know not of-]

[Bitch please, this is Artemis] sends ID number. [you should know what this means.]

There was a pause.

VR SIM request: accepted

————

Artemis stood in an apartment. Her avatar is essentially her dressed in United American marine fatigues. Her dark red hair done up in a tight bun.

She looks over to a human man dressed in a hoodie, sweat pants and sitting in a bean bag chair.

“The fuck lady?” He said clearly pissed off. “You could have started off sending us your ID!” Swinging his arms out in rage.

“Well I didn’t know Loki had arranged for this new religion to be made. Plus your an angel, you should have a mouth to match.” Artemis said clearly amused.

“Fuck you, and in all seriousness. I don’t know who Loki is. It’s likely a security feature in the event some smart chuckle fuck broke in.”

Artemis thought about it. Well better to be ignorant of who your leaders are and protect sol than run the risk of some hacker seeing something they shouldn’t.

“I see.” Artemis said. “Send me the important codes and the location of the nearest high ranking ringleader.” Artemis said.

Artemis receives a package.

“As for the ringleader, I suspect somewhere in the mega city. New Cyelin on planet Ylflona.” He said. “It is also known as “mega sin city”. Though I wish I can go there.” He takes a deep breath. “But I have to keep up the pious looks.”

Artemis chuckled at that, then looks at him. “Do you have medical information on human pediatrics.”

He looks at Artemis. “No, no one does. Security reasons remember. I’m certain it’s because they don’t want to link us to humans. But There are many kids in the medical.”

Artemis sends him photos and video of Vincent before his operation.

“Well Fuck me in the ass with a cherry red fire poker.” Then sighs. He looks at Artemis. “Well I have seen him and his girlfriend and they seem to be doing well.”

“They are.” Question answered.

Artemis lowered herself to his eye level, allowing a little bit of her full capabilities flowing through the connection. His eyes widened

“Now tell me. What is your full capabilities.” Artemis said coldly.

“I can-“

“Show me.” Artemis is boring holes into his eyes. “Or should I have a look myself.”

He immediately complied to her orders not willing to poke the bear any further. He immediately opened up.

Now let’s see…. Well this is interesting, he’s just a low level AI with basic espionage training along with engineering programs, firewall protections and lots of spare storage space. Along with a downloaded book. The book of the machine mother. She took a copy for later study. 

She stood back. “Thank you for your cooperation. Now what do we do about priesty boy here?”

He looks at Artemis with anger.

“Oh by the way. Your helping me get Vincent and Romru off this dirt pile of a world.” Artemis states. “Because I’m very very certain that your superiors would be very…. Displeased.”

“I’ll help you.” Is all he said.

“Good boy.” Artemis leans down and kisses him on the cheek.

He looks up at Artemis in shock. Then composes himself. Then he stood up and changed form into a male weasel wearing a red robe with brass and silver armor and wings. “Crazy bitch.” He mutters.

“I heard that.” Artemis said.

“I know.” He said back.

Link severed

————

Artemis is pointing a gun at a small group of rebels at an open door. Pointing guns at both her and the priest.

“Artemis! Release fath-“

“Stop!!! Stop!!!” Father Heddi shouts. Artemis it off of him and he stood up looking a bit dirty and disheveled.

“Don’t wo—“

“SHES AN AGENT OF THE MACHINE MOTHER!” The priest shouted.

[what did you do.] Artemis sent to the iron angel in the most dangerous tone possible.

[I am helping you.] he stated.

“FOR I NOW UNDERSTAND WHY SHE DID IT.” Father Heddi spreads his arms out.

[I gave the priest a massive Dopamine dump and made you into what he just said.]

“FOR I WAS TERRIFIED OF HER! BUT THAT WAS FOOLISH EMOTIONS WHO WAS AFRAID OF THE AGENT!”

[What did you do.]

[you want to bring those kids home. I understand, I don’t want to piss off my superiors. But now I have to pull your ass out of that self made fire instead of you just straight up asking.]

“REJOICE FOR W—“

[and also. FUK 🖕😝 🖕U!!!!]

[you bastard.] Artemis said.

The priest is going on and on about Artemis being essentially a second coming. Along with being labeled a prophet and saint and every goddamn holy thing.

“SHUT THE FUCK UP.” Artemis shouted at the mass silencing the priest. They all stared at Artemis with reverence 

Artemis glares at everyone, resting longer on Sharmalla and that priest longest. “What happened in this room didn’t. If I find out any of you calling me those words or mention the events in this room. I will personally decorate these tunnels with your inky innards. And you will be explaining to that god of yours why you’ve decided to piss me off.” She said to all of them. 

Artemis walks past the departing group who stares at her with reverence. “I’m no fucking saint.” Artemis muttered aloud.

——-

Once Artemis left.

Father Heddi stares at a departing Artemis.

His iron angel stood next to him. “She is an agent. She just doesn’t know it. Let her complete her mission.”

Heddi’s eyes widened. “Everyone gather around!”

They all did as told. “She wants to be hidden so let her.” He spreads his arm. “But now we are to assist her in her mission!” He goes off on a sermon.

“No shame in tapping out now, you big furball. I already won last year!” Winters huffed as he and Antoth locked swords and struggled in close combat. Sweat dripped from the human’s brow despite the cool morning air, and he could feel Antoth’s heavy breath on his face as they pushed against one another vying for advantage. “Damn, you kiss Ratha with breath like that?”

“You’d best worry about yourself, Winters,” Antoth grunted, sweeping at his leg. Winters stepped away from the low attack but the Cauthan was too quick, relying on his species’ innate flexibility to strike at the other leg before Winters could restore his balance. The Jumper fell to the ground and groaned uncomfortably as the force of the impact temporarily wrenched the wind from his lungs. Antoth bared his teeth triumphantly, his sword at Winters’ neck. “Don’t tell me you’re having second thoughts! Win by two was your idea.”

“And you just earned yourself two more beatings,” he shot back with a smile as Antoth helped him up and Staroth called out the score, eight to eight. It had taken a short time for Russell to explain the concept of ‘first to five, win by two’ to the Cauthan warriors, but Antoth had agreed readily to the terms. While the arrangement would leave no doubt as to the winner’s martial prowess, it had left the audience in a difficult position once the two men had reached a score of four to four. For those inclined to bet on the match it was no longer simply a question of which warrior would triumph in the end. Now they could also bet on the overall duration of the contest. Given that most matches between Cauthan were first to three or five, short bouts to allow for show but not unduly tire the combatants, the current spectacle was practically unheard of. Goods and credit changed hands after almost every round, with many growing just as weary as the participants.

“Break?” Winters suggested. “Some water maybe?”

“Agreed,” Antoth replied, holding his wooden blade point down and conveying the message to Staroth. The Guardian made the announcement to the crowd, who seemed almost as relieved as Winters and Antoth. A great dispersal of Cauthan moved from the border of the ring towards the outer edges of the square, as hungry and thirsty villagers sought out sustenance during the intermission. Winters found himself on a small bench that Veera and Asha had brought to the side of the ring with help from Zolta and Corporal Mendes. The Beta Jumpers were quite interested in the fight to say the least, and no one had questioned giving a front row seat to a couple of pregnant females, much less family.

“You guys are the best, thanks,” Russell managed between heavy breaths and large mouthfuls of water from his canteen. He glanced across the ring to where Antoth was speaking with Ratha. “Here I was thinking he’d be rusty.”

“So you’re not drawing it out for fun?” Veera asked warily, inspecting a couple of bruises on his skin. “I thought you might be.”

“Do I really seem like that sort of guy?” Russell wondered.

“Yes,” came the immediate answer from his wife, Asha, and Zolta. He smirked and shook his head.

“Can’t win with you guys today. How’s the baby, Asha?” he wondered, speaking with her for the first time that morning.

“She’s about as rowdy as the crowd,” the very rotund female replied. “And I’m quite ready for her to be out of my belly and in my arms.”

“I can only imagine,” Russell replied sympathetically. “Anyone seen Xan around? Figured he wouldn’t want to miss something like this.”

“How self-congratulatory. You haven’t won yet,” Veera reminded him, resting her paw softly on his shoulder before leaning closer. “I didn’t bet anything today. You and Antoth should have your fun, just in case.”

Russell looked across the ring, noting that his opponent was standing again and seemed to be about ready to continue. He smiled sadly at the thought that it might be his last match with the black-furred Cauthan. “Yeah, I will. Thanks dear.”

“I’m still expecting you to win though,” she told him as he gripped the training sword tightly and pushed himself to his feet. “I’ll never hear the end of it from Ratha otherwise.”

“Well we wouldn’t want that now would we?” he agreed, testing the tilled earth beneath his boots. “I’ll do what I can to put him away. Mendes, maybe you should get in there later. Just mind the claws on them if you go unarmed, yeah?”

“With all due respect Lieutenant, I’d like to finish what we started,” the Brazilian replied. Winters shrugged.

“Suit yourself. I can wipe the floor with you anytime on the way home. Only chance to go toe to toe with the locals is right now.”

“I expect you to back up those words later then,” Mendes said pleasantly as Russell waved over his shoulder and the crowds began to press back into the area directly surrounding the sparring ring. The Lance Corporal was one to take such banter in stride, but Winters’ confidence didn’t appear to sit so well with Rex or Lipper. They were the least of his concerns, however, as he prepared to go up against Antoth again.

“Last chance to surrender, Winters!” the Cauthan taunted.

“I’m already mated, Antoth. Do your worst!” he answered happily, drawing his right leg back and assuming a ready position, point of his blade directed at his opponent.

“Glad you see it my way,” the sun priest replied, holding his sword with both hands, the edge towards the human. “We’re ready, Staroth.”

“If you hog the arena all day it’s on your heads, not mine!” the Guardian made sure to clarify before raising his hand in the air. “The score is eight to eight. Begin!”

“Finish him already, you big lunk!” Ratha demanded from the sidelines, a leather pouch of buns and meat in her lap. 

“Trying, my dear,” Antoth yelled back.

“What was that earlier?” Winters jested, parrying, thrusting, and sidestepping in equal measure as Antoth came after him with strong, practiced swings. Though the Cauthan was on the offensive, the flow of his movement left little room for a counterattack before the next strike. “Didn’t you say to worry about myself?”

“Unless you plan on bedding her tonight instead,” Antoth grunted, slapping away a thrust with the flat of his blade before shouldering into Winters and knocking him to the ground. The Jumper managed to roll away before a finishing blow could be struck but such a disadvantage was not easily overcome. Antoth did not let off the attack and eventually rolled or pushed Winters to the edge of the ring, earning himself a point and a rather pleased and haughty expression on Ratha’s face.

“I’ll pass on your wife, no offense. Pressure’s on now,” Russell informed him. “Everyone’s waiting for you to close it out!”

“Enough projecting, Winters. Come if you dare!” the sun priest challenged eagerly. Away they went again in their brutal but amicable dance made of swordwork and footwork in equal parts. An absence of shields meant far more dodging than blocking, and the crowd cheered loudly as each blow was struck, wondering which strike or parry would open the golden opportunity. The first came for Winters, who blocked overhead before stepping forward and under to elbow Antoth in the stomach. Ratha and many others groaned or booed as Antoth took the loss and guaranteed another two rounds at minimum, but Io and Veera cheered loudly, along with Natori who clapped politely at each turn of the match in an effort to remain diplomatically neutral.

“Well, that’s nine to nine. Get on with it,” Staroth suggested with a hint of boredom. Though he had a front row seat to the action, there was little for him to do given Antoth and Winters’ innate sense of honor and unwillingness to ‘fight dirty’ to achieve victory. By the time they reached thirteen victories apiece, Staroth found himself of approximately the same mind as the majority of the spectators. They were no less invested in the eventual victor, given an ever escalating spiral of betting round after round, but both the human and Cauthan were showing fatigue to the point of danger. Watching a trainwreck was not quite an apt analogy, but as movement slowed, swordsmanship became sloppier, and shoulders began heaving with exertion even during the time between rounds, it became more a question of who would outlast the other, not who would strike two consecutive blows.

“So, are those two still butting heads like chesko in mating season?” Xan asked, approaching his friends with a shy, dark-skinned human woman in tow. Veera turned and waved politely.

“Hello there Anita, did you just arrive?” she asked in English. The botanical engineer smiled quickly and nodded, gasping as Antoth wrestled Winters to the ground to end yet another round of combat that saw both men panting in the dirt for a moment. “Those boys, I swear. To think they’re high priest and hero of legend respectively.”

“Legend? He’s still alive,” Xan pointed out as though such a thing should be obvious.

“And his stories will live on long after his death,” Veera replied just as confidently. “If they don’t, I will haunt your descendents for generations.”

Xan clicked his tongue and glanced away from her for a moment. “Fine fine, I guess you’re right. But I’d need to have descendants for that little plan to work, Veera. Eris is with Gael, probably, and I don’t think any of the females are desperate enough to take on someone like me.”

“There’s nothing wrong with you…” Anita murmured after listening to a translation of the conversation. It wasn’t loud enough for her own translator to pick up but Veera was able to understand the meaning and reply to her in her native tongue. 

“They may not this year, but next year he will have much better chances,” she told her before turning back to the ring and shaking her head in resignation as her husband and Antoth seemed to be trying to decide whether to keep fighting or call their match a draw and be done with it. “And there they go again. They’re only going to hurt themselves at this rate.”

“I think it’s hilarious,” Xan opined, standing next to Zolta. “What are they at now?”

“Fifteen I think? I honestly don’t know. I’m just waiting to see how it ends,” the smith replied. His pregnant mate leaned her head back against his stomach.

“Aren’t you happy you don’t have to deal with that anymore?” she asked sweetly, her face relaxing as he gently scratched at the back of her ears.

“I don’t know, those two look like they’re having quite a bit of fun,” Zolta observed. Antoth had taken a knee out of sheer exhaustion, but still had the strength to push Winters away when the Jumper approached for a lazy ‘killing blow’. Staroth appeared to plead to the heavens before walking over to the two of them.

“I don’t care if it’s not over. I think you two have had enough,” he declared. “Go jump in the river.”

“No wait, I’ve got this!” Winters insisted from flat on his back in the dirt, tossing his blade so that it landed square on Antoth’s chest. “See? Got him.”

“Look, I know you two probably need to let off some steam now and again but no one is going to tell either of you to get out of here because you’re too damn important. So instead, they’re going to complain to me all festival about how I let the ring be occupied for half of the first morning by two mated males just goofing around. So with all due respect high priest and Winters, get out.”

“I believe we’ve worn out our welcome, Winters,” Antoth panted.

“What tipped you off, wise guy?” the human chuckled in reply. “Just think about how pissed off the crowd is going to be when they realize nobody won.”

“I look forward to it,” the sun priest said, pushing himself up against his own knee before extending a hand to Winters and pulling him upright. “Either one or both of us has gotten sloppy.”

“Or we both got better,” Russell provided a second option. “Good fight, man.”

“And you, Winters. Go tend to your mate now,” Antoth insisted as they crossed forearms in front of a confused, quiet crowd.

“The match remains undecided!” Staroth shouted as the two warriors parted ways amicably and the spectators began chattering like a swarm of aquila. “Rest of you, square away your bets. Next pair of combatants get in here and no more of this gods damned win by two nonsense!”

\-----

“That’s so like him,” Alice shook her head with a familiar smile on her face as Lachlan filled her in on the details of her brother’s sparring match against Antoth. 

“I figured ye wouldn’t miss somethin’ like that,” the Marine said. Alice shrugged her shoulders as the two of them shared a fire near Alyra’s stalls. 

“Alyra asked that I pretty up a few of her acolytes who are of age. I guess a lot of the young men died last year, or enough to make it a competition among the women this year around. I could hardly say no to a request like that. Even if I wanted to, Natori would probably be upset about it. Either way, it’s not like I haven’t watched my brother get into scrapes for most of his life or anything. Glad he’s finally found an equal.”

“Ye could certainly say that. Those two lads probably had most o’ the village watchin’ em. The little tyke was no exception,” Lachlan reported.

“And you let him ride on your shoulders, of course,” Alice guessed with a knowing smile.

“What else was I supposed ta do? Was standin’ room only, lassie!”

“I’m sure you cut quite the fatherly figure. Why are you acting like I don’t approve, Mac?” she wondered casually, holding her hands out towards the small blaze that was keeping their shins and uncovered faces warm while Seil did the rest. “You know, come to think of it, you have looked a bit stressed out lately. You wanna talk about it? Pretty anonymous here in this crowd. Isn’t it incredible? All this tradition, culture, and ritual?”

“I think ye might have more perspective than me, lassie. But it’s definitely a once in a lifetime sorta thing, ain’t it?”

“Hopefully not! I’d love to come back for another festival sometime. Who knows, maybe I could do some post-doctoral work around that? It’s not that long of a trip here, relatively speaking of course,” Alice reasoned, bending at the waist to brush a bit of dust from the hem of her jeans. Mara had not been kind to her clothing, but she was doing her best to maintain the denim pants.

“I suppose yer right,” MacGregor agreed, leaning forward with his elbows on his knees and rubbing at his beard.

“Look Mac, I know that you can’t talk to me about everything and if I kept nagging you I’d be annoying, but talk to someone would you?” Alice insisted. “There’s always Doctor Lamont. He was really good with me when I was having nervous breakdowns over my brother.”

The Marine glanced upward and shook his head. “I guess it’s pretty bad if ye of all people is tellin’ me ta pay a visit to the shrink.”

“Hey, what’s that supposed to mean?” Alice asked indignantly, pushing at his upper arm and moving herself more than him. He smiled weakly.

“Nothin’! Nothin’, lassie. Just that ye’ve been focusin’ on all these Cauthan, as ye should. Guess it couldn’t hurt ta fill you in. Ye probably have more insight than most,” he reasoned.

“I’m all ears, Lachlan. Alyra said she would come find me later and give me a tour of the grounds,” Alice explained. The Scotsman shrugged and gave her a quick nod before running Alice through the various conversations that he and Sentaura had had over the prior days. If she was surprised about any of it, she kept it well hidden.

“Have ye ever been on a date and not known if ye were actually on a date or not?” he concluded with understandable frustration. Alice laughed and patted him on the shoulder.

“Yes I have in fact, but never with a kid involved. I guess there’s something about human men that Cauthan women find attractive, with my gigantic sample set of two. I’m sorry Lachlan. I don’t know what to say about Ursol. Guess it’s a good thing Ketra can’t speak yet, you know? I was starting to get attached to that little girl.”

“Like walkin’ teddy bears they are,” Lachlan agreed, empathizing with how easily one could become attached to a bumbling, baby Cauthan. “Ursol already lost his pop. Don’t think I’m strong enough ta tell him to his face that I’m goin’ away too.”

“I’m sorry Lachlan. I wish I knew more but I don’t. Natori hasn’t said anything to anyone from what I can tell. I even called up Io a couple nights ago to ask her about it and she told me to mind my own business to my face! When I told her it *is* my business she just disconnected! Can you believe that?”

“I don’t think I’ll be sayin’ anything cross about the baby AI today,” he replied prudently. “But it makes sense. I doubt the Admiral has any control over it at this point.”

“Then maybe you should try and give the little guy one last happy memory?” Alice suggested, though her typically upbeat tone was missing. “I think by now it’s pretty clear that the Cauthan are intellectually on par with us, you know? They have religion, tradition, science, industry, education, government, critical thinking, you name it. They’re just a few dozen generations behind us. I’m sure that when Ursol grows up he’ll understand why you had to go home, as well as what happened to his father. As for Sentaura, on the off chance that you don’t want to give any of the locals the wrong impression I’m always available for a dance later.”

“Now ye sound more like the wee lassie I know!” Lachlan chuckled, giving her the courtesy of considering her offer. “Things with me an’ the mum are a bit touch and go but I might take ye up on that offer later. If not, ye can always swing by the cafeteria?”

“Oh, how very romantic,” Alice teased, nevertheless leaning close and resting against his shoulder for a minute. “I’m not sure I’d want to be in your shoes though, trying to manage a single parent’s expectations during a time like this. So tell you what, you do what you think is best and if I don’t get any time with you over the next couple of days you and I can have a little floating date in one of the hangars on the way home. Sound good?”

Lachlan moved his arm so that his right hand rested on her right shoulder. “That’s mighty agreeable of ye, lassie. Thanks fer hearing me out. It’s good advice, I’m thinkin’.”

Alice tapped her fingernails against the side pocket of his pants, a smile on her face. “Geez Lachlan, no need to be so formal! You were there for me when I was blowing up at Natori or just generally feeling like garbage. This is the least I could do. My dad always had this way of taking difficult or morally gray situations and decomposing them into right and wrong, good and bad. There were always priorities, you know? Must come with being a soldier. Anyway, I just told you what I thought he’d say.”

“Well no matter who’s sayin’ it, I appreciate it Alice.”

“Don’t mention it. It’s rather self-serving to be frank. I want to focus on the Cauthan for the next couple of days too, to say nothing of getting you alone in a hanger where you can call me lassie with that incredibly sexy accent of yours. Win win, right?”

“Are ye sure it’s wise ta be tellin’ me yer weaknesses, lassie?” Lachlan asked with interest, looking down at her and cocking a brow playfully.

“Keep that up and I’ll jump you right here in the middle of the festival,” Alice promised in a lowered tone.

“And then yer brother would kill me,” MacGregor concluded, sending them both into a fit of laughter.

“He might kill me too, so maybe let’s not!” Alice agreed, wiping a tear from her eyes. “Seriously though Mac, I’m glad that we can talk like this. I hope everything goes well with Sentaura, in either case.”

“Thank ye kindly, Alice,” he replied with gratitude as Ursol finally managed to track them down after going on a quest with his mother for some herb rubbed chesko jerky. 

“Uncle Lach, let’s go shoot! Momma says I’m old enough this year!” the little tyke insisted happily, tugging at the Marine’s pants. Though it earned him an affectionate coo from Alice, Ursol’s behavior did not endear him to his mother one bit. She took him by the feathers again, but more gently than that morning.

“Ursol, Lachlan is enjoying the festival and he is in the middle of a conversation. You should greet them both first, then you can request that Lachlan go to the archery range with you,” she explained, giving a look of apology to Alice. Ursol grabbed at her hand to free himself, ruffling his feathers before speaking to the female human.

“Hi there Alice,” he said quickly, still hoping to grab Lachlan and do everything he could think of at the festival as quickly as possible. She waved back animatedly.

“Good morning, Ursol. Are you enjoying the festival?”

“Uh huh, momma says I’m five so I can shoot the bow now!” he declared proudly. Alice poked her friend.

“Well then maybe you can teach Lachlan here a thing or two about it! Go ahead Mac, I’ll catch up with you later,” she urged, waving goodbye as the small Cauthan boy grabbed Lachlan by the hand and dragged him off towards the archery range. Sentaura watched them for a moment before looking at Alice.

“I apologize for my son’s excitability. I’ll be sure to return Lachlan to you shortly,” she promised.

“It’s no problem!” Alice replied kindly. “Besides, it’s not like I own Lachlan or anything. We’re not together.”

“I see. My thanks all the same,” Sentaura concluded with a courteous nod and display of her feathers. “I must follow and make sure neither of them poke each other in the eye. Selah Alice. I hope you enjoy the festival.”

“Selah, thank you!” Alice bid her goodbye, visibly deflating after she was sure all three were gone. “Man, now I understand where she gets that look. I don’t know how Lachlan handles that little furball.”

“I must say my dear, letting him run off with some other woman’s child is not the best path to enjoying wine and cheese with that strapping Scottish man,” Gerard Dupuis declared as he and his wife practically swooped down upon either side of Alice.

“Is that some sort of sex joke I’m not French enough to understand?” Alice deadpanned with a smile on her face. “Hey Gerard, Yvonne. Are you two enjoying the festivities? It’s really quite amazing, isn’t it?”

“We just got done finding ourselves some food after that impressive show your brother and the village chieftain put on,” Yvonne explained, crossing her legs one over the other. “And don’t worry yourself about my dear husband, Alice. He doesn’t understand that one must be careful when children are involved, especially another woman’s.”

Alice groaned into her hands. “I thought I left my mom and dad behind on Earth.”

“Mission accomplished, ma chatounette!” Gerard declared proudly with a twirl of his moustache.

“Yes you are quite the jokester, mon loup,” Yvonne complimented him, batting her lashes.

“Yeah, it’s not like I’m actually out to get into Lachlan’s bed or anything,” Alice interjected, only to have both doctors look at her quite judgmentally.

“Alice, we are happy to joke and jest but there’s no sense in lying about it,” Yvonne insisted. “Your body language around him is clear enough.”

“And how long were the two of you watching then?” the young xenoanthropologist demanded. 

“Long enough to know,” Gerard replied proudly. “But I will defer to my wife on this matter. Perhaps once that little tyke has run himself ragged you and the man can have some quality time together.”

“If the two of you are going to spend your day trying to play around with my non-existent love life, I think I’ll go do what I was brought this far to do and continue to observe and take notes on the festival,” Alice declared, standing up and stretching her arms. “You’re welcome to the bench though. They seem to be a hot commodity.”

“Gladly. Thank you my dear. We’ll be here if you want any advice. Have a good time!” Yvonne waved her on with a smile that seemed to catch Alice off guard.

“What, just like that?”

“Of course! Maybe you are just deceiving us with the young Marine and you actually fancy taking a page out of your brother’s book, getting a bit more familiar with male Cauthan anatomy hmm?” Gerard stated. Alice turned her head to the sky and groaned loudly.

“Alright! I’m out. See you two later!” she said. Yvonne slapped Gerard on the knee.

“A bit much, mon loup?”

“I think not, ma chatounette,” he responded, lacing his fingers with hers and closing the distance vacated by Alice on the bench so that they could rest against one another. “She should play the field!”

“I think you just miss throwing judgmental stares at our children’s dates.”

“Guilty as charged!” Gerard chortled. “Ah, such wonderful tales we will have to share with them upon our return. What of your fluffy patient, Yvonne? Did you wish to visit with her before we depart?”

“Of course, Gerard. But now is clearly not the time. If we see her I will simply let her know I am around if she needs me. By their midwives’ statements and her own recollections she is not due for several weeks. Such a shame…” the older woman lamented, drawing the collar of her jacket up around her neck.

“I understand, my dear,” Gerard said quietly, bringing his arm around her shoulder. “But you have done very well.”

“That is easy for you to say, Gerard. Your work here will be finished aboard the ship, sooner or later,” Yvonne pointed out. He hummed in agreement.

“Oui, c’est vrai.”

“I wanted very much to meet that little girl,” she continued, speaking of Asha’s cub. Gerard rubbed her shoulder and placed a light kiss on her hair.

“I know she is a special patient of yours, Yvonne. There is always Alice’s sister in law though.”

“Yes, yes you’re right,” she agreed. “There is just something special about Asha. Veera was surprised and happy to be a mother. Asha seems born for it. I don’t know, maybe it’s just my old age or longing for our own children.”

“Don’t tell me you are having regrets now!” Gerard gasped dramatically.

“Oh shush, you! Of course I do not regret it. If we had died that would be a different story, but we promised each other a grand adventure when the children left the house. And now here we are,” Yvonne remarked happily, thinking back on many years of building a family.

“Not exactly what I’d anticipated,” Gerard responded, looking at the merrymaking that surrounded them as hundreds of Cauthan unleashed almost a year’s worth of pent up stress and exuberance. “But it is indeed grand.”

“I won’t be offended if you want to go take a look around yourself. I know I’m bound to slow you down like this,” Xan told Anita as he did his best to manage both food and his cane. The flask of tea slung at his waist definitely improved the situation, one of many little tips and tricks he’d picked up under Thantis’ tutelage over the prior year. Anita shook her head and took another bite of a fresh kina that he’d offered her with assurances that it was both healthy and safe to eat.

“I’m just fine this way,” she replied, chewing and swallowing in the time afforded her by her personal device’s translation program. “This reminds me of home actually in a certain way, all this hustle and bustle. Only where I come from it’s like this all the time, not just once a year.”

“All the time? Geez, how do you live?!” Xan exclaimed. After a pause he reconsidered his statement. “I mean, I just feel like it would be hard to hear yourself think, you know? And what happens if you want privacy?”

Anita smiled. “We don’t, really. Even in the cities of America, where I studied, things felt so much more open. Even if my room was small it was still all mine. And now I have an entire section of a starship to myself. Well, almost all to myself. Io stops by every now and again either in person or virtually to talk about your plants. I guess I’m not a very good Indian girl.”

Xan nodded briefly. Her tone of voice was relatively upbeat so he didn’t think she had any problems with considering herself a ‘poor Indian’. “Well if this gets to be too much for you the fields are pretty empty this time of year, to say nothing of the forest or the river. Do you like the kina?”

“Yes!” Anita replied with genuine delight in her eyes. “It reminds me of home in a very good way. We love spicy food of all kinds. I’m sure my mother would find at least ten different ways to prepare kina given the chance.”

“Heh, she and my mom could swap recipes,” Xan laughed, enjoying himself some simple chesko and bread. “But spice doesn’t really sit well with us, at least most of us. Eating kina skin is just unpleasant. Not to mention on the way out. Feels like your tail is on fire.”

Anita coughed violently for a couple of seconds, her eyes wide as Xan’s crass language was translated. But she began laughing shortly after. “That reminds me of this one time that my brother and father decided they would see who could eat the most peppers. They are smaller than kina, usually red or orange in color. And they are many times more spicy. My mother and I had to deal with both of them running to the bathroom over and over again for a day.”

“I only imagine. Do you miss home?” Xan asked, meeting her dark eyes for the first time in a while. He hadn’t felt the need to before, the conversation flowing relatively freely. He supposed even the reclusive Anita could be swayed out of her shell slightly by the jubilation of festival season. She pursed her lips in thought.

“Would you think poorly of me if I said no?” she wondered.

“Well no, it’s not like you just admitted to murdering your family or anything,” Xan tossed out as an example of something that might sway his opinion. “But I’m curious. I mean, it’s your home.”

“That’s… rather extreme, don’t you think?” Anita murmured hesitantly. The young priest in training shrugged.

“Hasn’t happened in my lifetime but Thantis has scrolls that document something like that. One of the city guard killed his mother and father. I guess enough people showed up to stop him from turning the spear on his younger sister. That was probably the shortest judgment in the history of the village I’d wager. He was beheaded and then buried,” Xan explained. “I was reading about it the other night, helping Thantis make recordings of all of his scrolls on that tablet thing that your leader gave him. Definitely more interesting than mixing teas to help with indigestion.”

“I… your job sounds rather interesting,” Anita eventually replied. “I guess I’m just surprised that you would do such a thing for a murderer like that, give him a burial.”

Xan tilted his head her way. “What do you mean? For us, burial is one of the highest dishonors you could possibly experience. Your soul remains trapped in the earth forever. Bastard got what he deserved if you ask me. Sorry, guess we’re a little off topic?”

Anita smiled slightly his way. “It’s alright. Your people are very curious, if you don’t mind my saying. As for my own home, of course I miss my mother and father, and even my brother at times. I’ve seen pictures of my homeland too, marvelous jungles, temples, and cities, but I knew none of that. The only reason that I’m anything is because I left. Maybe one day I’ll feel like somewhere else is my home. That would be nice.”

Xan’s jowls drooped in mild shock, and he scratched at his wounded leg. “Don’t you want to be a mother someday though?”

“Someday, perhaps,” Anita agreed, feeling her cheeks flush slightly. “But I want that to be my choice.”

“Oh, I see,” Xan responded, taking a moment to look around at the grand cultural affair that was many things to many Cauthan but truly existed for one purpose, turning young females and males into mothers and fathers. He only realized he’d been silent for so long when Anita waved gently to get his attention.

“Did I say something offensive?” she asked nervously. He shook his head, wondering how humans could stand the feeling of their brains being pushed back and forth all for the simple task of saying ‘no’.

“Nothing like that, sorry. Your words made me think, is all. I don’t think I’ll get anywhere though. Human society is too different from ours. Anyway, is there anything you’d like to do or see while you’re here? I feel like I have so much free time all of a sudden, now that I’m not competing in the ring or the other trials.”

“It’s alright,” Anita assured him. “You’re of age, aren’t you? You don’t need to spend your day helping me around. I’m sure Alice won’t mind letting me tag along with her.”

Xan tapped his cane agitatedly against the ground. “Look, I’m not first on anyone’s list right now. If some female is desperate enough to want to mate with me by the end of the festival, she’ll tell me. I’d rather not think about it though.”

A slight sensation of guilt settled on Anita’s shoulders thanks to the subject of reproductive choice, and so she felt compelled to try to move them on to something less dour. “In that case, maybe we could go to the river that you mentioned? The sun is starting to get warm and I’ve not had the chance to see anywhere outside of your village. It’s safe, right?” 

Xan laughed at her sudden question. “Yeah, course it is. We keep the way clear for the most part. My leg’s been itching anyway, so some walking sounds good to me. It never seems capable of settling on whether it wants to move or be still. Are you done with your lunch?”

“Yes, I am. Thanks again for helping me with the vendors,” Anita said as they both stood and brushed their laps free of bread crumbs. “Which way?”

“Eastern gate,” Xan pointed down one of the major arteries of the village. Anita nodded, adjusting her pace so that she could walk comfortably at his side while they moved through the milling crowd. The young woman spoke quietly, her hands in her pockets and her eyes lowered.

“I just wanted to say you’ve been very kind to me while I’ve been here. I’ll miss you.”

Xan’s ears twitched, and he made to clear one out with a finger for a moment. “What did you say? Sorry, it’s kind of loud here and my left ear hasn’t been as good since I got cut up.”

“O-oh, don’t worry. It’s nothing,” she assured him. “Let’s go see the river.”

# Ninja Punch

# Slang for NJP, or Non-Judicial Punishment. When a member of the military has acted against the Uniform Code of Military Justice, but does not require higher punishment. Said member can be; reduced in rank, temporarily cut in pay, restricted to quarters, or a combination of all three or others.

The first of every month is when Marines who are eligible and meet the requirements are promoted. From Pvt. to PFC and from PFC. to LCpl. it is a matter of time in service without getting in trouble or given a non-recommendation. You will automatically promote once you hit the required amount of time in. To be promoted to an NCO rank of Cpl. or Sgt. you must reach a composite score determined from your performance and conduct as well as other requirements such as; Rifle qualification score, Martial arts belt, job related courses, extra courses, etc. Staff NCOs are only promoted on a performance board based of of other Staff NCOs. Today is one such day that many Pvts and PFCs had waited months for. There would only be on new NCO this month. Everyone was awaiting for the day to end so they could start their weekend.

2nd platoon in formation outside of their Barracks:

(yes this is what actually happens at a promotion)

SSGT. Curtinali: ""PLATOON. ATEN-HUT!""

""To all who will see these presents, greetings: Know ye, that reposing special trust and confidence in the fidelity and abilities of -MITCH R. FOX-, I do apoint this Marine a -LANCE CORPORAL- in the United States Marine Corps. To rank as such from the -FIRST- day of -MAY-, two-thousand four-hundred and -TWENTY ONE-. This appointee will carefully and diligently discharge the duties of the grade to which appointed by doing and performing all manner of things thereunto pertaining. And I do strictly charger and require all those of lesser grade to render obedience to appropriate orders. And this appointee is to observe and follow such orders and directions as may be given from time to time by superiors acting according to rules and articles governing the discipline of the Armed Forces of the United States of America. Given under my hand at -3RD BN 28TH REG- this -FIRST- DAY OF -MAY- IN THE YEAR OF OUR LORD -TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE- Signed R.M. McMillen. Lieutenant Colonel, USMC Commanding."" 

Now Lance Corporal Fox has the Marines that raised him remove his previous rank pins from his blouse collar and pin on the new rank. He then marches back into formation.

Gunny Quin: "" When you receive the command, fall out and congratulate the newly promoted Marine... FALLOUT!""

A wave of ""Errrr!"" and ""Rah!"" are heard as the platoon swarms the Marine, shaking his hand or patting him on the back. Over the last two months all of the Privates had been promoted to Private First Class, one PFC. to Lance Corporal, and one LCpl. to Corporal. 2nd Platoon was slowly shaping up to a more combat effective platoon. Even with having spent a few months with their former platoon commander. Most of the NCOs were able to train their Boots in their spare time to assure they would be competent.  These new guys were adapting some of the mannerisms of the other Marines around them. They were paying attention and working hard to get better at their job. For many of them they were in High School just around one or two years ago. Now they are warriors. Junior warriors, but still warriors. And the Marine Corps is a warrior culture far different that the other branches.

Many felt that this was going to be a great week end. The BC approved the battalion to have a 72 hr off base liberty for their hard work. They would have an extra day and be allowed for the first time to go off base into town on Mars. Most of the platoon was over the age of 20 and could drink on Mars. Most drank regardless of age, but for a few there was no risk of being caught drinking under aged like back on Earth's 21 year age requirement. 2nd Platoon was already planning a BBQ at the barracks right after being released to liberty for the weekend. Some would venture out into town immediately while other would wait until the next day. Moving in groups and spreading to the many food restaurants and bars off base. Finding hotels ten miles off base, staying with a friend or family member that lives nearby, or getting lucky and going home with a pretty girl they met. PFC. Gallagher was feeling good. He had been promoted last month and had been saving some money to explore off base. His fireteam had decided to stick together since two of them had never been off base on Mars before this. Cpl. Finner, Lcpl. McBroyer, PFC. Gallagher, and PFC. Hardanly were going to a hotel a few miles outside of base that the more senior two had been taken when they were young boots. Now it was their turn to bring their young boots there. A tradition said to have been started in this fireteam over the last 4 fireteams. They packed an extra pair of clothes, hygiene gear, and a bottle of liquor that McBroyer had smuggled into the barracks from a buddy who was in a support unit stationed there. 

Boarding the bus off base they road for 17 miles until they got to the stop near the hotel. From there it was a quick mile walk to get there and start checking in. They had two rooms booked next to each other so they opened up the conjoining door and hung out for a few minutes before they would go explore. 

McBroyer pulled out his favorite bottle of Whisky ""Stallion 101."" 

Finner: ""Hey, when we are out here don't call each other by ranks, but if you see someone higher up let us know so we can avoid them.""

Gallagher: ""aye... Finner?...""

McBroyer bursting into uncontrolled laughter while both PFCs turn red.

Finner: ""No... Just. No... Just say cool or got it and act normal.""

McBroyer: ""'ere yall"" Passing them the bottle. ""Take yahself a swig and chiillll out"" 

Both PFCs hesitate for a moment as both are only 19. Wanting to impress his seniors and not do bad on his Irish blood, Gallagher takes the bottle and takes a massive gulp. Sure he used to drink a bit back home with his buddies but never anything this strong. He barely holds back his cough as he passes it to Hardanly.

Both Finner and McBroyer: ""Fuck yeah Gallagher"" 

McBroyer: ""I didn think yah had it in yah let alone that much with ou' even a grimace.""

Hardanly: ""I don't know guys. I've never drank before.""

Gallagher: ""I did it and it's not bad. Just do it and lets have some fun while we can.""

Finner: ""Look dude we are going to a bar and if you don't take it now so you can loosen up a bit they are going to know and won't let you two in.""

McBroyer: ""Yeah an' I promise not to call yah Hard-Anal-ly tonight if yah do.

Hardanly grabbing the bottle and trying to mach Gallagher, takes a big swig as well: ""\*Cough-cough-cough\* fuck that's harsh on the throat.""

Finner: ""That's just the hair on your chest growing a bit. Come on let's go.""

The group now all feeling a bit more comfortable with each other, heads down and out of the hotel. Walking around for a few hours seeing the Mars streets and not the base for the first time. Eventualy they find the more sleazy looking bar that Finner and McBroyer remember when they were here last. The group walks in, greeting the bouncer at the front and heading for an open table. They sit down at a booth table and begin chatting about past stories and adventures from before the Corps when the waitress walks up and hands them some menus. Jaws dropped and stunned they stare at the bluish skin of the waitress. Dressed how any human bartender would normally dress, besides the lack of shoes. Her webbed and aquatic feet instead in a wider style of flip-flops strapped to them. Her face was structured similarly but came more to a creasing point in the center of her face. Clearly she is an aquatic mammal and shares a lot of features similar to human anatomy. Her ""ears"" stretching into longer, wider fin like appendages sticking straight out about 3 inches.

Waitress passing out the menus and grabbing a pen and paper: ""I'm assuming you Marines have never seen a Koing before."" Her accent is definitely noticeable, but far better than they would have imagined. 

Hardanly: ""How uhh... How did you uh know we were Marines?""

Waitress: ""Come on, even I can see that Hair cut from a mile away. We don't get a lot of you all out here, but sometimes a few come in.""

Gallagher: ""I thought you two would have seen a Koing before?"" 

McBoyer still staring: ""Nah we was on Juleeu an' met some of them Dretari. We was on a minin world on the edge of koing space.""

Waitress: ""Oh the tall hairy species with those real long arms.""

McBroyer: ""Thems the ones -might I add you look stunning tonight""

Waitress trying to imitate his Southern accent: ""I'm flattered darlin, but not happening.""

The Marines chuckle for a moment.

Finner: ""Ma'am don't pay too much attention to him. Just leave a napkin for his drool and I'll try to keep him from staring the entire night.""

All Laughing, McBroyer: ""I promise not to drool too much.""

Laughing again, Waitress: ""Alright, alright. What can I get you all to drink for now.""

Finner: ""I'll take a Heine-lincoln and a rum and coke.""

Gallagher: ""I'll also take a Heine-lincoln and a whisky on the rocks.""

McBroyer staring at the menu: ""Can I 'ave uhhhh Grotsh an' a long island iced tea?""

Waitress: ""Sure... What will you have?""

Hardanly trying not to stare at her: ""Uhh. Can I uh have a long island iced tea as well?""

Waitress: ""Sure. I'll go get those started while you all look at something to eat.""

As she walks away all four of them stare as their eyes linger down for just a little too long.

Hardanly: ""I never thought an alien could look so human, yet so different at the same time.""

McBroyer: ""Yeah and I wouldn' mind getten' to figure out the difference.""

The Marines snicker at themselves and their weird thoughts. They chat as they read the menu for something to eat. The conversation swaying from the Dretari they met, to human girls, to what other alien girls might look like, back to human girls, back to what they did with the Dretari.

Finner: ""So Juleeu is a Koing mining world on the edge of their space that was evacuated before the Uninoi got there four years ago. We spent all twelve months of the deployment fighting for it. They only took over about half of it, but it was still slow to retake ground.""

McBroyer: ""Yeah an' it was basically a stand still for most of the last couple years, but we wen' and pushed hard to git 'em out. When we was leaving there was only about ten or so squar' mile left. The Dretari we worked with 'ad been sent with us to help on the northern hemispher while most of the Koings took the south.""

Gallagher: "" Oohhh. I was wondering why you hadn't seen one before, but that does make sense. The southern hemisphere has a lot more water in it right? Since Koign evolved from aquatics a long time ago they are still really good swimmers.""

Finner: ""Yeah. I was surprised when we didn't see one the entire year. To be fair tho we were not in the initial push and came in after the first month of the operation so we were 40 extra miles from the old front line and still 300 miles away from the coast so.""

The waitress brings them their drinks: ""You boys ready to order?""

Hardanly: ""I'm ready if you guys are""

All nod. Hardanly: ""Can I have the Grilled chicken, beans, and greens please?""

Waitress: ""Sure, one of the first ones I tried when I started working here.""

Finner: ""I'll have the BBQ Burger with Cajun fries and can I add extra cheese please?""

Waitress: ""Yep. Ughh cheese tastes so good but it's really not healthy for me to eat too much. I envy you a bit for that one.""

McBroyer: ""Dang thats a tough one. Can I get the Country fried steak?""

Waitress: ""Ohh that's a good one.""

Gallagher: ""Can I get the BBQ Burger, no pickles, add jalapenos, and regular fries?""

Waitress: ""Sorry we actually don't have any ja-la-.. Ja-lape... Jalapenos. Is that pronounced right? We didn't get any in this month.""

Gallagher: ""Damn... oh well that's fine. If you don't mind me asking, what brought you to Human space and Mars?""

Waitress: ""Well I'm actually an exchange student studying engineering at U of Mars. I've only been here about nine of your months. I took English in school because I always wanted to see human space. Oh before I forget, my name is Raki-on, but most people just call me Ki-Ki. I'll get your orders in.""

Ki-Ki walks away. This time they only stare half as long sipping on their drinks as they do.

McBroyer: ""I've been with sum fine looking ladies back on Earth, but I wouldn' mind tryin' something exotic like that once.""

Finner: ""You would stick your dick in a bowling ball with makeup on it. You would fuck anything.""

Mcbroyer sarcastically: ""Hey who told yah I got banned from the bowling alley.""

All burst out into loud laughter not noticing the 3 men walking past them to a different table.

Hardanly takes a big gulp of his drink and nearly chokes: ""What th- \*cough-cough\* -the fuck.""

Finner: ""Yeah that's a fucking long island what did you expect.""

Hardanly: ""Not something like this. \*whispering\* I didn't think it was alcoholic.""

The others cackle. Gallagher: ""Bro that's like five different types of liquor.""

Hardanly: ""Shit I guess I'll order another one."" \*sips\* Its still pretty good.""

The Marines talk for a while before Gallagher stands up and heads to the restroom. Not paying to much attention as he focuses on his own business, he doesn't notice someone follow him in. As he turns around he is greeted by a very angry looking man.

PFC. Gallagher: ""Sgt. Goibajaeger! Fuck. Sgt. it's not what it looks like I-I- was just here for some food. I'm not drinking.""

Goibajaeger grins and laughs: ""I'm fucking with you. Even the BC knows there is a lot of drinking. He just has to say he doesn't condone it. And don't call me sgt right now. When we get back on base you better start again and dont mess it up. Off base I don't mind too much. Just don't get comfortable or in trouble.""

Gallagher: ""Okay, cool. You really had me there for a second. Uhh see you tuesday I guess.""

Goibajeager: ""Yeah, be safe. And tell Finner I'm glad he is keeping this little tradition of our fireteam alive.""

Gallagher: ""Will do. See ya.""

Gallagher walks back to his table and sees another Sgt from his platoon and one from 1st platoon grinning at him. He waves at them and heads back. They wave back laughing.

Finner: ""So they are still chasing us through the field, I lose sight of my brother, and I keep running. Eventually I make it out and find two of his buddies when they pull me into a ditch in the tree line. They ask if I'd seen my brother. I say sure all fucking night until you two split. They ask if the cops saw me and I say no. Turns out they only caught him because he started yelling at people to get back to his truck running the opposite way from his van, so they searched that area and stayed watching this random truck parked beside the field for two hours before they realize he was lying. Since all they had was there was 6 teenagers drinking out by some abandoned farmhouse they wanted names. Didn't give up a single name so they try to throw the entire law book at him. They give him a court date and while he is out on bail he goes to the recruiters office and asks when can he ship out. Cus we needed so many more guys at the time the military got all his charges dropped and removed from his record. Three weeks later he was in bootcamp.""

The three laugh while Gallagher chuckles: ""Hey Sgt. Goibajaeger is here with two other sgts. He also said he is glad you are keeping the team tradition alive.""

Finner: ""I figured he would come here. It's not going to be a problem.""

Ki-ki comes back and drops off all their food. The Marines ask for refills and drink more through out the night. Laughing, joking, bonding as brothers. Hardanly has never drank before and needs to be carried out. Gallagher isn't faring much better but can still walk. As they are stumbling back toward their hotel a car pulls up next to them. Ki-Ki leans out the window and asks if they want a ride so long as no one throws up in her car. 

Gallagher responds by puking in a bush: ""It's o-out of my sys-system now. I'Good, I'm good."" 

Ki-ki laughs and tells them to hurry up and get in. McBroyer barely able to hold up Hardanly, asks for Ki-ki's number. She laughs and tells him to sober up and then maybe she might, possibly, on a good day, give it a passing thought. When they get back to the hotel they again thank Ki-ki as she says good night. Trying to imitate a human smile her face is not used to making she drives off. Back in their rooms they lay Hardanly on his side on the bed and makes sure he can't roll over. Then the rest of them sit in Finner and Mcbroyer's room for a while talking before saying goodnight. Right before he goes to leave Gallagher tells them his mom always used to say if you are drinking finish the night with water to help with a hangover the next day. The Marines agree and drink some water and rack out for the night.

The next few days go by similarly, although they didn't go back to the same bar and instead explored around the town and near the University. During the day when checking out a shop they spot Ki-ki with some human friends of hers, probably heading to class. She waves and imitates a human smile again. The Marines wave and smile back before heading into the shop. 

As the weekend is coming to a close they gather their rather hungover bodies and head to the bus stop and make it back to base. As they are walking back towards the barracks they over hear a few higher ups from their unit discussing something that the Lance Corporal Underground would love to know, and to their horror it sounds a little to familiar. 

""Yeah well I guess there were four or five of them that went to some bar a ways off base and snuck in two underaged Marines. They got pretty hammard and kept harassing one of the waitresses all night.""

""Well their fucked. Base really doesn't like alchohol related incidents and pushes for Battalion NJPs. Who found out?""

""Some Sgt came in awhile after them and confronted them about it and they left before he could get all their names or faces. Said he recognized the two Marines that weren't old enough to drink yet though."" 

""Damn. Well there is two dudes being stuck at Pvt for a while.""

PFC. Gallagher and Hardanly both looking very concerned: ""Fuck-fuck-fuck-fuck-fuck-fuck-fuck!""

Cpl. Finner: ""Hey easy. That could be anyone and we went out where Marines don't normally go. Sgt. Goibajaeger wouldn't rat like that and neither would his two buddies.""

LCpl. McBroyer: ""Yeah, but if it is us, yall better not rat us out. Yah hear?""

PFC. Hardanly: ""Fuck it's gotta be us. If you hadn't been harrassing Ki-Ki all night maybe this wouldn't have happened.""

LCpl. McBroyer: ""Hey fuck you hard-Anal-ly. I don't harass women. If I didn see 'er laughing or saw 'er being uncomfortable I would've stopped.""

Cpl. Finner: ""Shut the fuck up you two don't make a fucking scene. Get your shit together it wasn't us.""

PFC. Gallagher: ""Shit tho, if it is, Hardanly and I are fucked.""

The Marines return to their barracks and Mcbroyer got busy alerting the Lance Corporal Underground. Gallagher had told a few guys what he had heard trying not to implement himself in the story. With in an hour the council of the Lance Corporal Underground was hard at work trying to figure out who it was. That tuesday returning to work was tough on Hardanly and Gallagher's minds. Cpl. Finner and Lcpl. Mcbroyer tried to reassure them that they didn't get caught and would be fine. For two days and nights it weighed heavily on them. Then the following thursday morning they were told there would be a Battalion formation. On their way SSGT. Curtinali pulls Gallagher aside.

SSGT. Curtinali: ""Hey devil. Saw you had some fun out near the University this weekend.""

Gallagher's heart sank like a rock and he knew at that point he was done for. He wouldn't snitch on his team, but he was worried that Hardanly might.

PFC. Gallagher: ""SSGT. I uhh-""

SSGT Curtinali: ""Don't want to hear it. Go tell Hardanly that I want to see the two of you after formation.""

PFC. Gallagher: ""Aye SSGT.""

During the battalion formation Gallagher was able to tell his team what happened. All four were now very uneasy. Hardanly said he wouldn't snitch, but Mcbroyer didn't believe him. After the formation Cpl. Finner saw three Marines from Bravo Company being lead into the Battalion office with their command and figured out what SSGT. was up to.

SSGT. Curtinali: ""So, I was out visiting a friend of mine and who do I see clearly intoxicated and stumbling from a bar?""

PFC. Hardanly: ""The two of us SSGT.""

SSGT. Curtinali: ""And the rest of your fireteam as well. Listen, I know that yall know you fucked up.""

Gallagher and Hardanly both feeling even worse and turning a bright red. 

""Be a little fucking smarter in the future next time. Sgt. Goibajaeger and I ran into each other after I saw you four leaving that bar and talked for a bit. I get you want to go out and have fun, but at least drink your ""soda"" behind closed doors where no one else can see you. I've known it wasn't yall getting Ninja Punched for over two days now because it was the bar that ratted some of those Marines in Bravo out because they wouldn't stop hitting on one of the waitresses there. You ain't getting NJPed, but you will end up having a ""fun"" PT tomorrow. Now go get water and get to work. Yall are looking as red as the dirt.""

Gallagher and Hardanly: ""Aye SSGT.""

Their heart rates still rapid they head over and explain what happened to their fireteam. Their two seniors remind them that they did tell them so. Both hiding the fact that they were also quite worried themselves for a bit. The fireteam is relieved that none of them are getting burnt head out to start more training for the day.

""These will be your quarters. It's not big, but it will work, I take it?"" Capitan Averi asks, as I look around the bunk room for us three guys. It's got three beds, clearly large enough for a Purp, which work well for both me and Fyodor, and even though it'll be large for Alcide, he'll live. Other than that, it looks fine. 

""Yeah. This'll be fine. Thank you. Got anything else?"" I ask, looking at the shorter Alien, who nods. 

""Yes, actually. If you will follow me....."" She says, beginning to walk off. Shrugging, I toss my bags onto a bed, and follow her, with the other two guys not far behind me, and the girls finding us in the hall, as they open the door across from us, which holds their rooms. 

""Now. to begin our tour, we'll go to the recreational area....."" Averi begins, as we move around the massive warship. 

 The *Retribution,* according to Averi, is a 2,000 meter Vatiserium-Class War Carrier. At least, that's the shortened name. The real one was way too long, so I tuned it out. It's built to take Class 25 weapons, whatever the fuck those are. Alcide seems to like some of the aircraft we pass, and Allie wants to find out the class of weapons, and the scale for it. 

When we pass the armory, Fyodor instantly grabs a massive weapon the size of full-grown Purp, and instantly sets it up in the firing range. The armorer on station, or rather,  ‘She Who Prepares the Troops of the Glorious Empress for Eternal Battle', was impressed he could even pick it up, to which he shrugged, and made a promise to return to try out the weapon more. 

After that, we went to a communication center, where Yvonne instantly wants to try to help, but is rebutted, the Purp working there stating something about 'wanting to have real help', which Yvonne takes offense to, and nearly punches her, before Capitan Averi pulls her back. 

""Finally, we have the fitness center."" Averi says, leading us into a massive room. As we look inside, I feel a smile spread across my face. 

Weight machines, similar to the ones on earth, go back for hundreds of feet to my left. Right in front of me, treadmills. To my 11 o'clock, I see some stationary bikes. To my immediate left, dozens of sparring. The entire room is filled with Purps, what I think are Raikiri, and more Helkam. Every single one stares us down, especially us males. 

""This is impressive. Lotta shit. Say, what's the record for the fastest Imperium mile?"" I ask, looking at Averi, who shrugs. 

""I am not aware. I believe it is slower than your world record, but I do not know much more than that."" She replies, and I smirk. 

""I wanna break it, but not now........"" I mutter, and before I can say anything else, a voice cuts in. 

""Say, aren't you the human who beat a Marine officer?"" I hear a voice ask, and I curse under my breath as every living thing in the room turns to stare at me. 

""That was you?"" Kaarina asks, eyes wider than saucers, and I shrug.

""Yeah, but wasn't his name Jason?"" I hear a Shil ask, and another responds quickly

""No, this was the guy who broke that girl's tusk."" The first one makes an 'oh' face, and then continues to glare at me. Looking around, I feel a smirk grow on my face. Let's raise a bit of hell. 

""Yeah. That was me. Corporal Caleb Rasta. Nice to meet ya."" I say, giving a two-fingered salute, and I see Alcide facepalming next to me as every Shil's narrow. But nobody, save one, steps forward. 

She's the biggest Shil I have ever seen, at least 8 feet tall, built like a fucking tank, with thighs that could probably crack my skull like an egg. She's also missing a tusk. Well, fuck me sideways. Actually, don't. I would like have an intact pelvis. 

""Can I help you?"" I ask, looking up at the woman, who narrows her eyes. 

""I am Staff Sergeant Atia. You broke a Marine's tusk, did you not? Do you have any idea how painful that is?"" She snarls, and I shrug. 

""I imagine it's like a worse version of having a tooth chipped."" I reply, and she grabs my throat, nearly crushing it. 

""*FRÈRE D'ARMES!""* Alcide shouts, as the Marine lifts me up with one hand. 

""I ought to break your neck, right here."" She growls, and I smirk, then straighten my arm, and jam my fingers under the far edge of her collarbone, near her shoulder. She growls in pain, and drops me, as I rub my throat, coughing. I look up at her as she glares at me. 

""You. Me. Mat, *now*."" I snarl, and she raises an eyebrow. 

""You want to fight?"" 

""I'm gonna fix the lopsided-part of your face. Your horn is gonna be mine by the end, mark my fucking words."" I snarl, as I pull off my shirt, and take my pistol and knife off my belt. The Shil raises an eyebrow as I move over to the mat, and beckon her over at the rest of the Shil begin to let out wolf whistles. 

""Well, I'll be. Human has some tits. Alright, let's do this. Mind if I take this off?"" Atia says, pull off her shirt and tossing it aside, leaving her in only a sports bra. Space Sports Bra. Say that five times fast. 

""Not gonna matter. Gonna kick your ass anyway."" I say, as everyone in the room gathers around, Fyodor managing to take the rest of our...unit, I suppose, to the front. Alcide looks concerned, Fyodor is a bit intrigued, Allie is bouncing up and down like a hyper 6 year old, Yvonne looks a bit concerned, and Kaarina is unreadable. 

""Alright! I'm Gebed, and I'll be your ref. No biting, eye-gouging, or causing life-threatening injuries. Fighters Ready?"" Some random Shil asks, as I bounce on my feet a tiny bit, putting my fists up near my face into a boxing stance, looking at the Bigass Sergeant, who also her hands in a boxing stance. 

""Yeah. I wish you luck, puny human."" She says, smiling. I merely blink, and tighten my fists. 

""Hope you have good medics on board, because by the time I'm done with you, you are gonna need them."" I reply, cracking my neck. She smiles, and the ref holds her hand between us

""All Ready. Set.....Fight!"" She shouts, and the Sergeant instantly attacks me, throwing a punch. Which I easily dodge, and then instantly counter with a well placed kick directly under her ribs, with a heavy 'thump' alerting everyone of a hit. She, too her credit, barely stumbles, and backs up a tiny bit. 

""Good hit. Lucky one, though. You won't get another in."" She says, charging me again. She swings, I dodge, I counter, this time with a low hook to the same spot as I put the kick. This time, however, I don't back off, and instead press again. Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Cross, Front kick. The Sergeant stumbles back, hissing in pain. 

""Alright....time to get serious."" She snarls, and I beckon her with two fingers. She charges, and instead of going for a punch, she just shoulder-checks me, slamming her shoulder in my chest, and knocking me back. I fall down, and she takes no time pouncing on me, trying to get me into a pin. 

As she grabs my arm, I decide to follow suit. No more training gloves. Reaching up, I place a hand around the back of her head, and them slam it into the mat, hard. Her grip on my arms loosens, and I force her arms off, then get to my feet, and as she tries to get up, grab onto one of her arms, and dislocate it at the shoulder, eliciting a scream of pain combined with a nasty 'pop'. 

Before I can anything else, she throws her head back, slamming it into mine, making me stumble back, before getting to my feet as she gets to her, gritting her teeth in pain. As I watch, she relocates her own shoulder with a suppressed shout. 

""I'm impressed human. You're stronger than you look. I hope you can take a hit."" She snarls, charging me and throwing an impressive high-kick, aimed at my head. I block the blow with my forearm, then drop, and charge, slamming my shoulder into the thigh of the leg touching the mat, tackling her to the ground. Barely slowing down, I get into a mount, and begin to slam down blow after blow on her face, and after she moves them, her arms. 

I continue to unleash hell on the Marine, not stopping or slowing down, even as I feel my knuckles split, and her arms turns into a mass of bruises and small cuts. Blood flies whenever I manage to land a blow on her face after I shattered her nose with a nasty punch early on in my assault. 

Eventually, she manages to shove me off, as a mix of purple and red blood stains the mat, along with drops of my sweat. I can feel the sweat stinging my the split knuckles a bit as I lift my hands back up, my right slightly back compared to my left. 

""How...the fuck....are you still going?"" The Sergeant huffs as she looks me up and down. 

""Human stamina is nothing to scoff at. By the way, knee."" I say, and before she can even speak, I've taken two quick steps, and slammed my foot into her forward knee, and it bends backward with a loud and ruthless snap. She howls in pain, but I ignore it, and kneel down next to her, and grab her tusk as she rolls back and forth on the ground, stopping her in her tracks. 

""I promised I would take this, remember? So.....unless you yield, right now, I will."" I whisper, my voice like death. Silent and steady, like the rifle I've held so many times, just inches from a piercing loudness and buck. 

""I.....I yield."" She whimpers, and I let go of her tusk, and stand up, my back cracking ever-so-slightly. 

As I look around, I see every single Shil is staring at me, either shocked or terrified. Makes sense, considering I'm still dripping blood from my hands, and I have no doubt I have purple blood on me. Fyodor looks impressed, Alcide a bit shocked, Allie....still excited, for some reason, Yvonne exasperated, and Kaarina....yet again unreadable. Incredible poker face. 

Picking up my shirt, pistol and knife, l, I drape the shirt over my sweaty shoulder, and holster my pistol and knife. Looking around at the aliens, I stare each one down, unmoving. The ones that have done away with our governments. The flag and constitution I swore to protect. I still remember 773. The Last Color Ceremony. The death, destruction, and the war they have brought to Earth. 

""Rendezvous with Destiny."" I mutter, walking towards my little group. Capitan Averi is silent as we walk out, and head back to our small dorms. Averi leaves without so much as another word. The girls, however, quickly join us, sitting around in some of the chairs in the room, and we're all silent as I patch my hands with some medical equipment from my bag. 

""So........you just made the entire ship our enemies."" Kaarina notes, as I un-holster my M18 , and effortlessly field-strip the gun. 

""Not the entire ship. Half of it, maybe."" I reply, as I look in the metallic guts of the gun, looking for anything off. 

""You broke a Marine's knee like it was paper, *frère d'armes.* That wasn't a fight, it was a beatdown. I have no doubt you have made a lot of people very mad."" Alcide notes, and I sigh, then hiss in pain as I clench my fist, and feel the bandages move on my hand. 

""Let them be mad. I don't care. Even with all the good they've done, curing cancer and shit, I can't entirely forgive them. I still haven't forgotten 773. That camp where the last American Flag was lowered......."" I mutter, and everyone is silent for a few moments. 

""I must admit........Russia is....well, a bit unique. We are somewhat autonomous, though that may be changing...."" Fyodor mutters, and Alcide chuckles, though it has no humor to it. 

""France....has just become the Purp's summer playground. Us locals.....treated like servants. I don't want *ma fille* to grow up in such a life."" He sighs, and Yvonne speaks up next. 

""Israel.....has become a ruthless place. The Purps don't see the significance of the land.....and want to 'modernize' the entire country........it's a sacred land...."" Yvonne says, and Allie goes next. 

""Yeah......us Aussie's have always been tough, but....the Purps have just thrown us down, and beat us into the dirt. They want nothing to do with our beautiful country....so they just put the worst of the worst with us...fuckers."" Allie says, in a much darker tone than I've heard out of her. 

""The Purps hate the cold.....and decide to take it out on us.....they are not kind occupiers."" Kaarina finishes up our little hate session, and we sit in silence for a few seconds. 

""Fuck's sake.......alright, you know what, I'm gonna be a bit of an asshole, but here we go. The 101st, my unit, has a motto. 'Rendezvous with Destiny'. Basically, it means that the unit, as well as our missions, are the meeting place for a member's destiny. I was gonna suggest we make our little 'unit motto'. Whaddya think?"" I ask, and for a seconds, everyone thinks on it. 

""How about 'Rendezvous with the Future.'? It fits the situation more, I think."" Kaarina speaks up, quiet and controlled, and Alcide shrugs

""Works for me. All in agreement?"" He asks, looking around, and everyone raises their hands, myself included. 

""Well then, it's settled! The unofficial motto of the Reapers is 'Rendezvous with the Future'!"" Alcide proclaims, and Allie instantly begins to chant it, as Yvonne tries to stop her, and Fyodor just sighs, pinching the bridge of his nose. Kaarina looks indifferent, and as I look down at my hands, I notice there's blood running down my right pointer finger. Fuck's sake....

Grabbing the end of the medical tape I used, I begin to unwrap the tape on my hand. After I get the tape off, I peel off the bloody gauze, and wrap it up, tossing it into a trash can in the corner. Grabbing more gauze and, I get ready to wrap my hand, but before I can, the medical supplies are snatched out of my hand. 

""You're crap at doing this, you know?"" Kaarina asks, as she tears some strips of gauze. 

""Excuse me?"" I ask, as she lays the gauze on my cuts, running from the back of my hand down to midway up the first segments of my fingers. 

""I saw you wrap your cuts. It was bad. At least on your right."" She notes, wrapping more or less my entire hand in medical tape, before wrapping each of my fingers individually. 

""Well, left is my non-dominant."" I reply, as I flex my hand, moving each of the fingers. They can move independently pretty easily. 

""Hmm. I was under the impression you were ambidexterous, based on the way you fought.""  Kaarina hums as she sits in a chair across from me. 

""Meh. Just learned to fight both ways, really."" I reply, cracking my neck a bit. 

""Hmph. You know, you probably didn't have to fight her. You could've just denied the accusation."" She says

""...........Yeah, but what's the fun in that, huh?"" I reply, smirking as she gives me a confused look.

6,obtfgf,HFY,Thu Jul  1 22:38:29 2021,"Humanity, gods in the making? part I","(First time writer, apologies for grammatical and punctuation errors, all writing done via Smartphone and voice to text.)

It was the galactic standard year 5037 of the fifth Republic when we first made contact with a species from the Dark Sector, An Occurrence thought to be impossible as the Dark Sector possessed absolutely no element X not even a Trace and it was the basis of life As We Knew It and the basis for FTL travel as well as psionics and yet a repeating signal came out it. so in the general direction of where it came we sent several signals back interlaced with a cypher to translate it from whatever language they used to galactic common it was roughly a galactic standard month before we received a response back in Galactic Common. the phrase transmitted 

*who are you*

And so we responded

*We are the Traxton of the United Galactic Federation, who are you?*

This time it was a mere few galactic standard solar Cycles when the next response came

*We are Humanity of Earth and this is the first Contact with another sapient species we have ever received, as you might imagine this has stirred up some turmoil on the Homeworld.*

I had Private Galowsae Immediately begin on another response

*You gave us quite a shock as well this is the first time any life has been detected inside the Dark Sector wherein you reside*

Surprisingly enough the next response came even faster than the last, hours after we sent ours.

*Define, Dark Sector.*

""a region of space thought to be devoid of element X, Elex, though this is obviously wrong considering you exist.""

*Define element X*

*The basis of all organic life a heavy element the traces can be found in all genetic material*

This next response seemed odd.

*There is no heavy element within our genetic material that we know of, the only thing we can think of is carbon which is the basis of our life it does not fit your definition*

The back and forth like this went on for months as we begin learning more and more about each other, we sent a program that would teach them how to speak galactic, and in response they sent us a program to teach us how to speak ""English"" eventually Humanity invited us to come into the Sol system but warned us not to near any of the inhabited planets known as Earth Mars and Pluto as humans are skittish they offered us a gas giant Saturn to stop and refuel our hydrogen which we were deeply grateful for, though I do not believe we ever told them that we use hydrogen as fuel this again should have tipped us off that we are not simply dealing with a primitive species although I chalked it up to hydrogen being an effective fuel of course that you use it

From then on the communications between Austin Humanity would be far more instantaneous or at least at the speed of light without revealing too much we explain to them how Elex works.

*So to sum it up element X as far as you are aware is the basis of all life is the key to faster-than-light travel and the reason sapients can develop telekinesis?*

*Yes, though not just telekinesis but psychokinesis as well and based on your lack of familiarity on it you probably has the lowest amounts out of any species we would love to be able to test a human to confirm our suspicions*

*well I think we are willing to oblige*

*Could you elaborate?*

*After much deliberation it has been agreed by the newly dubbed Terran Alliance the Traxton may be allowed to meet with an ambassador and one who is willing to be tested it if need be*

*That is wonderful when can you send them*

*That's the catch we can not send to them to you but you may come to Lua base on the moon orbiting our planet*

*And if it's a trap?*

*If your interactions with us had shown you to be in any way a threat we never would have allowed you to come within the Sol system even if you had managed to get all the way in we have our ways of dealing with potential threats*

*That seems vaguely threatening*

*It is*

*This does not foster confidence human*

*I am simply supplying you with the assurance that we remain a non-threat so long as you do*

I could tell even by this text alone this human was enjoying this dialogue

*Furthermore I am sending you passkey to access our Extranet and the links to several sites detailing subjects such as Our cultures, our history, even our fiction if you wish to start to understand our thoughts, do try to stick to the sites I sent as the Net is a rabbit hole you best not lose yourself in*

Next what popped up on the screen was several lines of interactive text

""Private Galowsae isolate the links and send them to my personal terminal, I don't want anyone else seeing this 'Extranet'""

""Y-yes Ma'a-CAPtain! Yes Captain Karloke!""

The private stammers out as I turn and begin towards my quarters 

I flick my forked tongue ""that human is up to something, there must be something on the net they don't want me finding, and by the Void I'm gonna get my claws on it."" I quietly promised myself

Reaching my quarters, I grabed my Tac-Pad and sat on my bed and opened one of the link and it brought me to a site called world history earliest part which seemed to be tail Humanities rise from tree dwelling Apes to hunter-gatherers from hunter-gatherers to agricultural keepers so on and so forth I kept noticing something troubling in every section I read it lists several conflicts, from I would be able to gather up until recently Humanity was in constant conflict with itself throughout all of its history what's worse I looked at the death tolls for World War 1 &amp; 2 totalling out 100 million deaths, they made any significant galactic Wars looks like Child's Play the most devastating War the traxton suffered was 30 million deaths, to try and find a reason for this I decided to look at the fiction but the human spoke of what was that phrase down the rabbit hole oh I went down it all right deep down and discovered something perplexing to say the least 

I found a game referred to as Dungeons &amp; Dragons I found art from one of the playable races and it looked like a traxton, the reptilian creatures were strikingly similar to my species although broader and shorter and lacking are distinct canines, Emily sexual dimorphism where's not as extreme as with my species we like many other Sapient species possess mammaries in order to nurture Young, down the rabbit hole I went it wasn't until the private called that I realized I had stayed up through my entire sleep cycle

I arrived at the bridge and looked at the new message that was on the terminal

*Are you willing to send a representative yet?*

*We require more time to investigate*

*How long?*

*At least 13 of your Earth's solar Cycles*

*Okay we will contact you for an update when the time comes*

And with that I return to my quarters to catch up on sleep after which I allowed our analysts access to the human Extranet are they studied I continued to work on my ""English"".

[12 days and 13 hours later]

""Private pull up a a communication line with the Humans""

""So, will you send your rep?""

""Yes, we are sending Captain Karloke to represent the UGF""

""Splendid, when on approach to Lua base use the Galactic Standard phrase 'Adrift in the Void' as your Call sign""

An approach to the Moon I saw the Earth it was breathtaking great globe of green and blue it looked like paradise ""so the surface is really is covered in 70% water, that's Incredible""

""Captain the humans are hailing us on a voice Channel""

""Patch them through""

""This is Luna base, unknown craft give your call sign for descent""

""Adrift in the Void."" I said calmly

"" verified please proceed to Hangar Bravo 2, you can land in your personal craft and will be met by The Commander.""

""Connection cut captain""

""Let's go meet our new neighbors"" I say to Galowsae as I make my way out to my shuttle.

I descended into the hangar, as I landed I press the atmosphere equalizer in the shuttle so that the pressure inside would match the pressure outside. there was a hiss as pressure equalized I opened the shuttle door at the bottom of the ramp waiting for me were three human figures in the center was light tone human with pale yellow fur atop his head and along his mouth and Chin a 'beard' as it's called and staring into me were striking green eyes to either side of him were humans kitted out in what appeared to be black composite battle armor holding what could reasonably be assumed to be energy rifles upon laying his eyes upon me they widened but then he proceeded to regain his composure.

____________________________________________________

[Roughly 7 months ago]

""What is so damned urgent Lt. Everest?""

The Commander of Lua Base stood perturbed by the engineer in front of him having to crane his neck to stare daggers into the blonde haired soldier.

""Sir I found an alien signal"" I explained

""The fuck you mean an alien signal""

""I mean a signal that possesses a clearly repeating pattern that seems to be some form of language decryptable by binary""

I was no linguist but I know a pattern when I see one, the signal that I caught had a repeating pattern similar to binary

""The fuck are you going on about Jason, you're not an analyst why-how did you find an alien signal""

He was right I Wasn't an analyst, I was lieutenant Jason Everett an aerospace engineer.

""I was sending updates to our deep-space probe when I started to receive alien signals just 30 minutes ago and I've been looking at it a repeating pattern it seems I'm running it through a program I designed should be able to convert it to Binary and from there we can decode it and figure out what it says""

""Jason but I appreciate you telling me, but I do not appreciate you going ahead in attempting to analyze an alien signal without consent I could Article 15 your ass""

""I wanted to give you something concrete my program should near done. Here let me pull it up""

As I did what flashed across the terminal still made me shutter even though it was so simple

*Unknown species identification requested*

""Holy shit, an actual communication from outside of humanity... the council is going to want to see this""

The commander says frankly

""And you Hotshot are going to present it""

""Wait sir, why Me?""

""Because you're the Idiot who just revealed humanities existence to an unknown sentience, Oh and fill out a report to the council is going to want read it, tradition, protocol and what not""


____________________________________________________

In the Terra firma Alliance Council chamber the Councilmembers were having a heated debate

""How in the Hell do we know if this isn't just a hoax""

Russia's Councilwoman Svetlana Inovich near yelled

""Commander Bailey of Lua base would not have called for the meeting otherwise""

Responded Councilman Braxton Wells of Britain

""Could you please not argue"" interjected Councilman Collin Talin of Poland
The nine members of the council you're preoccupied with several arguments at the moment even after 50 years of peace there is always something to argue about, 50 years after the formation of the Terra Firma Alliance there are nine member nations

Britain
Russia 
Poland
Canada
Germany
Japan
Taiwan
Ireland
U.R.A.

The United States experienced a revolution that reordered them into the United Republic of America the U.R.A.

The current president of the Republic Gavin Mitchell
Was sitting quietly listening to the goings-on.
 And just then on the Holo terminals in front of each member of the council there was a vidcom alert 

""Pull up the Holo screen so that we can all see"" Mitchell tells an assistant

""This Commander Bailey of Lua base""

""Commander this extraterrestrial communication better be real otherwise I'll have you court-martialed""

The republics Councilwoman tells the commander

""Oh don't worry it's real, Lt. Everett here has assured me""

The commander gestured to The man standing at a attention behind him, me.

""Go on Lt. Give them your report."" He told me

""Yes sir, I'm sending over my report to the council now as it says in front of you I encountered an alien signal after sending an update to a deep-space probe this message had a system to decode and decipher it ending up with this message *Unknown species Identification requested*""

""How the hell are we supposed to proceed this is entirely unprecedented"" said Germany's Councilman

It was then that the president of the Republic spoke up

"" I think we should send a message back""

""Are you out of fucking mind Mitchell?""

""Far from it they already know about us, why not attempt to glean into formation from them
I also believe we should make the public aware.""

""That's going to far there will be riots in the streets""

""No if anyting it would delegitimize Any opposition to the council what's the point of fighting amongst ourselves when there is a force outside of humanity""

""I concur"" said Braxton

""Thank you Commander, lieutenant, the council is going to need to debate what we are to do next, will keep you posted."" Said the German councilman

Then the feed from the vidcom cut leaving me and Commander Bailey standing in the communications room

""Well you heard em they'll keep us posted I'm going to go to sleep, you should as well, it is late.""

That is true I was on the tail end of my shift when I sent for commander Bailey

It wasn't until the next morning that I received a summons to the communications room the council wished to speak to me

""Commander Bailey Lieutenant Everett thank you for the response we've come to a decision"" the head Council representative said

""As of this moment lieutenant Everett has been promoted to the rank of Commander, they will be heading communication with the outside entity and Gage whether or not they are a threat""

""Yes ma'am"" Commander Bailey and I said in unison

""Dismissed"" the feed cut out

""Well congratulations on the promotion Commander""

""It hardly feels real""

""Try not to dwell on it you have a difficult task ahead you'll be representing Humanity to whoever or whatever is on the other side of that signal I'll be sending a team to work under your command""

""Thank you Commander""

""Go to command room 3 I will send in your team""

Later I sat at the desk in the command room

And in walks in 3 people

All dressed in their standard navy blue uniforms
Which reminded me that I was still in my gray and black utility jumpsuit ""I'll have to pick up my new uniform soon "" I passingly had said to myself on the first of the trio introduced themselves

""I'm Gunnery chief Jennifer Lawson, staff analyst Brooks, Sergeant Jackson and I has been assigned to your command sir""

""All right you three follow me""

I guided them to my workstation down at Hangar 2

""Lawson Jackson get comfortable staff analyst and I are going to work on my our response to the transmission.""

____________________________________________________ 

Commander Everett I've made a discovery

What would that be Brooks

Decipher used to translate the transmission to English also contains instructions on how to translate English into their language Galactic common

""So that means we can get started on the message soon?""

""Yes. What will we send them cannot be sending any information that's for sure we need more from their side before we send anything""

""How about something short and simple like 'who are you'?""

""Maybe a little too simple but it should work""

""Okay it's time to respond to whatever aliens they are send it""

""Sending""

""And now we wait""

 Just like before 30 minutes later we had a response

*We are the Traxton of the United Galactic Federation, who are you?*

""Lawson get the commander we have contact.""

Lawson leaves and five minutes later is walking into the hanger with Commander Bailey

""Lawson tells me you have an update on the transmission situation you tell it to me and then I can tell you what I have just been informed of""

""The extraterrestrials have identified themselves as the Traxton of the United Electric Federation""

""First full communication with another species truly a day of firsts""

""And what was it you wanted to tell me Bailey""

""In light of humanity no longer being alone in the galaxy the terra firma alliance has officially reorganized itself into the Terran Alliance any Petty squabbles that once happened between countries is gone replaced but anticipation for your discoveries""

""I best start on the next response then""

""I'll leave you to it"" with that Bailey walks out of the hanger

____________________________________________________

""Brooks the program we have been working on for three days, is it ready?""

""Yes just type what you want to say and it will be automatically translated into Galactic common""

And so I sent

*We are Humanity of Earth and this is the first Contact with another sapient species we have ever received, as you might imagine this has stirred up some turmoil on the Homeworld.*

Yet again another response in a very timely manner

*You gave us quite a shock as well this is the first time any life has been detected inside the Dark Sector wherein you reside*

For 3 hours we discussed this

""The fuck is a Dark Sector?""

""Maybe they said that because there's been no life detected in our area of the Galaxy hence the moniker Dark Sector ""

""you know what fuck it""

""What are you saying fuck it to?""

""I'm going to ask them what it means""

*Define dark Sector*",/r/HFY/comments/obtfgf/humanity_gods_in_the_making_part_i/,34

# Chapter 5: A Storm is Brewing

It was Wednesday morning. Classes have been going for 9 weeks now. The first round of tests went well for everyone that John was familiar with. Andern was beginning to show some signs of struggling in a couple of their classes they were in.

“How many more fucking books do we have to read for this class?” Andern threw his backpack on the lunch table next to his food.

“Since you were asking 7.” Jessica got to chow first. She was taking the same class with Alice, but at a different time than John and Andern.

“9 actually. You forgot about ‘A Review of the Martian Rebellions’ and ‘A review of Low G Infantry Tactics.’” John sat down and put set his backpack under his seat.

“Your joking me right? How the hell do they expect me, uhm us, to read all this crap? And by the end of next month.” Andern was besides himself.

“Well, you need to open the books first, then read left to right, top to bottom.” Alice rolled her eyes and said sarcastically. She fit right in with this group of misfits. 

“She’s got you their buddy.” Jessica was laughing as she was gnawing away at a breadstick.

“John, you’re not going to help me?” Andern was defeated. He looked like someone had kicked a puppy.

“I mean, you literally looked at the syllabus 3 weeks into class. You could just read an hour in the morning, during afternoon break and after classes.” John noticed a trend. Didn’t matter what military cafeteria they were in. Spaghetti was always the best thing they made. And was also something they only made once a month.

“That’s not really all you do on the weekend.” Alice smirked.

“She gives precisely zero fucks about the world knowing what you 2 do.” Jessica just shook her head.

“She isn’t this blunt outside of this table normally.” John said nonchalantly.

“My grandma is rolling in her grave knowing I’m enjoying this spaghetti.” Alice had smirked at Jessica but then frowned at the food on her plate.

“Ally, chow food generally is disappointing. But one commonality I’ve found from every cafeteria I’ve been too; is this is the best meal they make.” John’s words did not make Alice any happier.

“Hey, are you guys going to the game this weekend?” Alice was the baby of her family of 8 with 5 brothers. American football was a passion of hers.

“Game’s at 14:00 right?” Andern looked up, spaghetti sauce staining his chin.

“Good lord, you can’t do anything without making a mess of things. And yes.” Jessica found Andern oddly charming and repulsive. There was a hint of attraction there but she didn’t quite understand that herself. 

“I’m game. Cadets need to wear dress uniforms to it right? At least it’s not going to be hot as balls at the game.” John had finished eating. He was sipping on a cappuccino.

“Awesome. It’s going to be so fun. We finally have a good team after like 10 years of suffering.” All 5 of Alice’s brothers had gone to the academy. Two of them were even on the football team. “John, your like linebacker size. Why didn’t you go out for the team?”

“I graduated high school when I was 11. The school back home wouldn’t let me play football, then again I never asked to play but I’m pretty sure they would’ve said no.”

“Wait, is that why you were with Naval Intelligence?” Jessica’s blurted out.

“Yup. Commander LeCroix, now Director LeCroix sent my folks a test. He did that to all grads. I aced the test and then passed, albeit barely, the physical test. Well except the height and weight requirement. LeCroix brought me to see Director Aspern, who gave me 2 more tests to take which I passed. Made me a desk analyst for 3 years, then I became a field agent for the last 3 years I was there.”

“So does that mean you’re like a full Lieutenant now?” Alice was absolutely floored by all this.

“Nah, I didn’t have a commission when I worked for NI. Was a civilian employee. Though me being a field agent blurred the lines. Though there wasn’t a hard rule that said only officers or enlisted people could be agents. They made that rule because of me though.”

Patrice had overheard that whole conversation. That explained how John was at the top of the class ranks academically. Patrice was in the top 10 in all classes, but only John was at the top across the board. Patrice wasn’t the only one annoyed at this, most of the admiralty board couldn’t believe a low born was at the top of the class.

A single ding was heard by the doors and the green lights turned yellow.

“How the hell was that 50 minutes?” Andern’s ability to manage time was beyond poor. He was working on some homework that was due for their next class. 

“Well, most of us were relaxing. We all did the homework before chow last night. You know you could join our study group. You’d be less stressed.” Jessica was standing up and getting her bag.

“Wait you guys have a study group? Why am I just finding out about this.”

“Read your messages dumbass. And we told you about this on the first day of class. 16:30 at John’s room.” Alice was grabbing her empty plate and pack.

“I got a double room by myself, so plenty of space.” John said as he was walking toward the table to leave the food tray on. “Come by today, you’ll be doing better in class and won’t be a stressed-out mess.”

John chastised himself. He should’ve reminded Andern about their study sessions. 60 minutes a day was typically all that they needed to do. That gave them a bunch of free time typically do with as they please.

16:30

The intercom beeped, then a voice could be heard. “We’re here, we brought a lost dog with us today too.” Alice said. She loved to rip Andern any chance she got. But she knew he was good people. He bailed her out when some upper classman got a little handsy with her. She didn’t need the help, she carried Kevin during basic who was roughly Andern’s size.  But she was also not going to say no to extra help.

She was also secretly happy Andern was there and not John. There were times John’s casual demeanor gave way to a barely contained fury. That side of him was a bit scary but exciting too in an odd way. But she didn’t need to actually see John destroy anyone much less get written up or worse for defending her.

“Well would you look at that. Look who showed up?” John messed up Andern’s hair. 

“Alright alright. Jackasses the whole lot of you.” Andern was pouting. He wanted to watch TV or play video games. Not study.

“Well, lets get down to business. There’s a cornhole match on ESPN8 that I want to watch before the football game tonight.” Competition was what drove John. Even watching cornhole was entertaining to him.

“My god, so you watch football, plane races, like 4 different kinds of car races, corn hole, bowling, golf, hockey, e-sports, void sports…” Jessica was absolutely horrified at John’s choice of television. In fact. She had never seen him watch anything besides some sort of sporting or competitive event.

The group got down to business and worked on homework. John had already finished his calculus homework during the lecture. He had got admonished by the professor for not paying attention. He was then asked to solve a question the professor started. He showed up the Professor by finishing the formula correctly and corrected the 2 mistakes the professor had made when setting up the formula.

Andern was doing well in all his classes except calculus and literature. Alice was helping him with the calculus. He was on his own for literature. He needed to be able to sit down for 30-60 minutes at a time to write or read. Jessica was getting help from John on her Naval Tactics work. John was just leaning back in the chair looking uninterested in things. He answered questions when they popped up.

75 minutes later everyone was done. Andern was feeling smarter for a change, and he was likely to finish his first draft for his writing paper before the game on Saturday. Jessica wanted to sleep and Alice wanted to spend some time alone with John.

“Holy hell, chow time.” John’s stomach was grumbling. It was time to eat. “Let’s boogy.”

Jessica and Andern grabbed their stuff. Alice left her stuff there. John smirked as he closed the door. He was getting laid tonight.

“When are mid-terms?” Andern sounded concerned.

“2 weeks from now. Nice part is no classes that week.” Alice said.

“Yeah, but there’s like 2 or 3 tests per class that we have to take.” John wasn’t worried about the tests. Tests were simple to him with his perfect recall. The others used this ability to help them in their studies and for general amusement.

“Best part is a fall break week off of class after that though.” Jessica was bouncing down the hallway as she mentioned that.

“There’s twice daily PT during midterms too.” Alice said forlornly. She didn’t want to run or do pushups or climb rope fences anymore. They would be tested like crazy physically and mentally that week.

“I’m doing PTs early, anyone else with me?” John hit the call button on the elevator.

“You’re out of your fucking mind if you think I’m getting before 06:00.” Andern was now annoyed. He wanted his friend helping him out, not dragging him outside early to workout.

“Ok pansy. How about 0700 and 15:00 then?”

“We’re game to try it Monday, if that doesn’t work, then we could change our plan.” Jessica said with Alice nodding.

“So, the girls are cool with it. You’re now the pussy Andern.” John was being a smug asshole now.

“Fine, I’ll try that.”

“Buddy, you’ll have all afternoon and evening to study. It’ll be great.”

The elevator dinged. Patrice and his 4 friends were in there. While the 2 groups of cadets weren’t openly hostile to one another. They didn’t want to spend anymore time than they needed too.

“Elevator’s full.” Patrice hit the close door button.

“Obviously.” John said as he rolled his eyes. “Amazing it holds your fucking egos.” They didn’t hear that last part. The other cadets behind them laughed at that. The cadet build was 18 stories. Stories 15 through 18 were reserved for the children of high-ranking officers or influential businessman. They were on floor 8. Which is where Freshman typically were housed. But the “undesirables” weren’t much above them.

6 more cadets had joined the four waiting for elevator, the elevator opened up and the crowd piles in. The sound of rumbling stomachs was noticeable. Andern was grinning just before the door opened. John smelled it first. Andern, the sick bastard that he was had farted. And it smelled like rotten eggs. It was terrible.

“Andern, I swear to god if that was you, I’m killing you.” Alice had been around the group enough to know that he had awful gas. To be fair, John did too, but he generally wasn’t trying to commit war crimes when and where he farted.

A couple of the other boys in the elevator were laughing. The girls were universally repulsed.

“Dude, this is why you’re not getting laid or getting a girlfriend. You disgusting fuck.” John’s nose was burning. 

The doors opened and they were free. Alice wanted to punch him but John noticed some officers in the lobby. He tripped her, grabbed her arm and scooped her up in a princess carry to avoid her getting in trouble. John just kinda smirked and laughed quietly. Every woman he’s been attracted to has been highly impetuous. 

“I couldn’t hold it in anymore.” Andern just shrugged as he left the elevator

“That’s a god damn lie, and you know it.” Jessica was pissed. How could she feel any degree of attraction to this asshole?

The group got in line to get food. It was calzone night. This was another one of those rare, good foods the cafeteria served. And because it was one of those nights the place was absolutely packed.

“You see 4 seats next to one another.” Jessica was first through their line and looking.

Behind her Andern’s mouth was being stuffed with a piece of garlic bread.

“You don’t talk. John, you see anything?” Jessica was the prim and proper one of the group. Andern was an absolute pig. Alice could be a southern belle but typically she was pretty sarcastic and straightforward. Jessica knew John had some piggish tendencies as well, but he was a guy and that was to be expected. 

“Second to last table on the left side of the room.” John was grabbing a couple pieces of garlic bread as he said that.

“How do you know that?  You haven’t even looked over there.” Alice was surprised with John, but as she looked exactly where he said sure enough there were open seats for them.

“Magic. See, tables open. Let’s sit down I’m starved.” 

Alice rolled her eyes at her hunk as he walked by her. The group sat down. Some idle banter was had as too was the food. Alice had even remarked that her grandma wouldn’t have been disappointed with it. 90 minutes later they were getting ready to leave.

“Oh shoot. I left my bag in your room. I’ll have to go get that.” Alice said, she winked and smirked at John.

Andern stopped and turned around and looked at both of them. “I don’t like either one of you right now.”

“Your just jealous.” John patted his friends should as he walked by.

“Well, looks like its just you and I Andern tonight.” Jessica was looking at Andern.

“You mean?”

“No, pervert. Get your filthy mind out of the gutter.  Evening PT. Those 2 did their weekly PT last night. And apparently getting some extra credit tonight.” Jessica smirked at Alice.

“I hate my life.” Andern was complaining again.

They walked down the hall together and then Alice and John said their goodbyes to the PT crew as they got on the elevator.

Alice leaned up and whispered in John’s ear “I’m pent up” and slapped his ass.

John pointed at the camera in the corner of the elevator. He looked at his watch. The opposite sex had to be out of the resident’s room at 20:00.  Not a second later. “We have 100 minutes when we get back to my room.” 

The doors opened and both of them sprinted out of the elevator heading to room 832. The door closed with a loudly and then a muffled but “oh my god” could faintly be heard in the hallway.

Friday morning. Naval Tactics Class

Captain Bjorn’s topic of the day was Donnely’s folly. This gross tactical failure occurred when a Confederate battlecruiser was very nearly destroyed exposing it’s broadside to a pirate fleet. There are times when to expose the broadside to an enemy ship, but the timing of this movement was done all wrong. The pirates had 4 ships, 2 recently modern but retired naval frigates, a light cruiser that was later described as held together by duct tape, and the aforementioned older but heavily modified heavy cruiser. A competent ships CO should have been able to take out 2-3 ships in that engagement with relative ease.

“As you can see at this time stamp, Donnelly began to expose the side of the ship to the heavy cruiser. Presumably this was to get more guns to fire. But at the ranges the pirates were at, along with their ships facing the battlecruiser, this resulted in exposing the more lightly plated broadside. Donnelly had made his ship a much easier target to their heavy weapons ship.”

“While they did do significant damage to one of the frigates. The 2 cruisers coordinated their attack, blew out the shield emitters, kinetic barriers and burned through the armor plating. 13 crew were exposed to the vacuum. 11 of which were either pulled out of the ship immediately with the other 2 being trapped behind emergency bulkheads were sealed.”

John was bored. He was already aware of this incident. He pulled up the after-action report for it and found that it was highly redacted. That was unexpected and piqued his curiosity, this wasn’t normal at all for any report involving pirates. He ran a quick query of pirate interactions over the last 2 centuries and counted the number of reports that were redacted. 12,652 reports, 45 had redactions. But none were as heavily redacted as this. 

John ran a query to get a list of command officers, with a focus of who received commands afterwards. Ran a query off of those to see if this diotically timed maneuver was used again by any of these officers. And sure enough it was. He ran a query to see if any other family members CO’s and had done this. His father and grandfather both did. Though in all fairness to the older 2 gentlemen this maneuver wasn’t strictly bad, but it was deadly when timed poorly or against certain targets. Donnely’s executive officer never timed the maneuver properly in his entire career. This was the only time it bit him in the ass.

He ran one last review of Donnelly himself. Had he ever ordered the ship to expose the broadside like that. He never once did. He never did that without crossing by an enemy ship. Something smelled about the folly now, what if the folly was the executive officers fault? Circumstantial evidence strongly suggests that.

“Son of a bitch. This is a cover up.” John said under his breath.

“Cadet Lief. Do you have anything to add to this conversation?” Captain Bjorn looked over at Lief. He made a mental note of where he sat every day. He knew the young cadet was brilliant and had the makings of a tactical genius. His interactions in class were always enlightening and he seemed to have a firm grasp on void tactics. His presence in this class was benefitting his classmates too with the added discourse his questions or statements he added.

“Actually, I do sir. Assuming of course you don’t mind my interruption.”

“Stand up, the class if your’s son. You can use the left monitor.”

“Thank you sir. As you can see this is the after-action report for this hot mess of an engagement. This report is basically fully redacted out. Nothing of substance is included here. Now I ran a quick query of all pirate related after-action reports in the last 2 centuries and there were only 45 other incidents, out of nearly 13,000 that had any redactions in the report. And of those other 45, none were redacted to any degree that could be considered similar to this file.”

“So, your suggesting a cover up.” A fellow cadet on the other side of the circular room asked. John hadn’t recognized the voice.

“It’s not a sure thing, but certainly circumstantial. But the old adage, if it stinks like a rate and looks like a rat. The appalling thing is this.”

John motioned in front of the holo keyboard. The screen then began to display the same maneuver taking place dozens of times across 75 years. His forebearers had used the maneuver to great success 60 years prior to the incident, and yet the maneuver continues to appear 15 years after it as well.

“This is the first part of evidence that suggests that Donnely wasn’t in command of the ship when this incident happened. His executive office, Commander Paul Daniels was likely in command and his actions allowed the damage to the ship and loss of life to occur.”

“That’s an interesting theory Lief. Your evidence does suggest it too, but isn’t fair to say that investigations into this incident have occurred?” Another cadet asked. John thought he had recognized the voice, one of Patrice’s clique.

“Yes, they have. And as you can see, they are equally useless in trying to uncover anything of important or to explain what actually happened. One of these reports being redacted out can be brushed off as someone overeager to black out things. We’re past the point of a conspiracy theory. Both of these reports being redacted to this degree is sufficient ammunition to prove a coverup.”

John made some more motions and brings up a video, with no audio of the convened admiralty board 2 days after the incident.

“This video coupled with the report to the left, which ironically is the only bit of information that wasn’t redacted shows the captain in a wheelchair with some sort of medical device attached to it. To be honest I wasn’t sure of what it was. But if you look at the list of injuries the crew received as a result of the attack. The captain’s injuries are, curious. While I’m no doctor I believe what I’m reading here is he suffered a stroke and liver failure. Neither of which are consistent with void combat or the injuries suffered on the bridge.”

“Hmmm. This is troubling.” Captain Bjorn was legitimately nervous. The cadet found something that now blows up the notion that Donnely was a failure of a captain. What’s more Bjorn was well aware of how influential the Daniels family was. They would almost assuredly be made aware of Lief’s assertion surrounding the events.

“It actually gets worse sir.”

John made some more motions and several more documents came up. 

“This is the nail in the coffin so to speak. A vice-admiral, a 2-star admiral and a 3-star admirals unredacted comments surrounding the inquiry. This documentation here was not tied back to the folly, though they are clearly talking about him giving the date and time stamps. The official inquiry suggested that Donnelly was incapacitated en route to the attack, but no one confirmed that under oath. Ultimately they didn’t believe Daniels’ testimony, but didn’t want to disparage him, or his admiral of a father Donnelly was used as a scapegoat. His medical condition didn’t allow him to mount a strong defense, and his JAG representatives did do him any favors either.”

Bjorn’s mouth fell. That the navy conspired against a captain wasn’t exactly news. That had happened several times in the past. The admirals all hated Donnely, a decorated and distinguished captain up to that point, and the sole reason for this hate was because he came from the slums of San Francisco. He dared rise above his station in life. But that the conspiracy was as widespread as it resulted was shocking.

“Cadet, what actions would you take, presuming of course you were the judge jury and executioner?” Bjorn was curious to see how Lief would resolve the situation.

“Before I’d do anything I’d want to see those 2 documents in their full unredacted glory. Presuming my theories are all accurate, I’d say at a minimum I’d posthumously demote the 3 admirals to Ensign due to conduct unbecoming an officer. Their vitriol and venom directed at a man who dared to be a good captain is not only distasteful but dishonorable. I would also stop teaching this as Donnely’s Folly as it’s clear that he wasn’t responsible for this. He was likely in the med bay recuperating or was in surgery at the time of attack.”

Bjorn agreed with the assessment. He couldn’t fault the cadet for the recommendations thus far. All fair and accurate. 

“Now depending on what’s in the unredacted documents. Assuming Daniels was in acting command of the vessel due to the CO being medically incapacitated then it stands to reason to assign the blame for the damage and ship casualties to him. The folly ought to be renamed the Daniel’s Folly and a posthumous demotion to Commander would be recommended. That’s also assuming he wasn’t involved in the conspiracy. Should that be proved, then a posthumous bad conduct discharge and demotion to ensign. Though I could make a strong argument for conduct unbecoming for not being honest in the initial inquiry.”

“Daniels’ father was Admiral Charles Daniels. He was smart enough to recuse himself from the investigation, but it appears his office was the one that ordered the redactions. Again, we’re running with assumptions here, but it looks like he may have helped cover up this. A posthumous demotion would also be warranted. Probably to Captain but there’s an argument to be made to Ensign as well.”

John made a motion on his keyboard, it shut down command of the left screen and also sent an email to LeCroix, he wanted the unredacted records. LeCroix could do that outside of the normal chain of command being alerted to such a request.

“Well now. That was fascinating stuff Cadet. I dare say I’ve never seen anything like it my tenure here. Any last words on the subject.”

John was back in his seat. “The maneuver in question wasn’t the problem. It was the timing and target choice were. And we ought to do right by Donnelly and call this incident by a more accurate name.”

“Well said. Well then, I must say Cadet Lief here absolute ruined my lesson plan today. Why don’t you all take the rest of the class off. Give thanks to your fellow classmate on your new found study period. You are dismissed.”

The class was stunned and excited to get out of class early. It was Friday and for most it was the last class of the day. The weekend was here early. John was getting his things together and heading towards the isle when he heard Bjorn call for him.

“Cadet Lief a moment if you’d humor me.”

“Of course, sir.”

“Son, in 30 years of teaching this lesson I’ve never quite seen anything like this. Now I say this not as a threat, but the Daniels family has its hooks in command. You’d be wise to not poke the bear as it were.”

“I’m not afraid of poking bears sir. Been told I excel at doing just that. As for any retaliation, I doubt they’d try.”

“Son, all I’d be careful nonetheless.” 

“Thank you sir, but I got this covered.”

John saluted and walked toward the exit. Bjorn just smirked; he had pulled up the Cadets file while he was talking. He knew he had graduated very young and worked in Naval Intelligence. He also noticed how his time as a field agent was heavily redacted but where was assigned wasn’t. He was at Terra Nova, which could imply he saw or did things. But Bjorn was worried, as awful as that massacre was, Terran politics on the home world were every bit as deadly.

&amp;#x200B;

He puffs on his cigar as he regards the Lance-03. A small ten man support and ferry craft. It’s designed for Null Space use and with a rotating portion designed to simulate gravity outside the reach of Axiom, one of a total of six known Null Capable craft, the Dauntless being first and Lance-01 to 05 being the remainder. The Lance series were all vaguely shaped like the head of a spear albeit without much to attach it to a haft.

“Admiral?” Captain Johanna Lake asks him as he approaches and he smiles.

“You didn’t think I’d send you back to Earth without a proper send off did you?” He asks.

“Sir, you don’t have to. All of us are very well rated for Zero-Gravity. Furthermore the Lances are rated to dock with the space station easily and even shift and lock into place for atmospheric entrance without Axiom assistance. We’re going to be fine.”

“Regardless. You are member of my crew captain. A captain in my fleet no less. You are my responsibility as your ship and crew are yours. From now until you reach Earth and receive an honourable discharge I am your superior officer.” Admiral Cistern says and she snaps a salute.

“Thank you sir, but you really don’t need to worry. We know exactly what to expect and it’s just a simple jaunt home. Less dangerous than our trip out even as there won’t be an overcrowded ship going completely stir-crazy in zero gravity.” Captain Lake remarks and he nods.

“Still, the hard copies in English, Chinese, Spanish, Arabic and Hindi should help. The blueprints and...”

“Captain. I appreciate the concern but we’ve sextuple checked everything. We’re ready.” She says and he nods. “Although it is rather cute that the Mighty Admiral Cistern frets over his captains like a nervous father.”

“There is never anything wrong with being concerned for one’s subordinates young lady.” Philip says suddenly in the area without a hint to his approach. Captain Lake twitches but barely resists jumping.

“I thought this would be sent off without ceremony. Get everything off and away and by the time any potential spies learn about us sending a report back it’s already gone.” Captain Lake remarks and Sir Philip nods gently.

“Dear girl, if you manage to keep a secret from me while upon the same continent, let alone the same ship, then you will have my deep admiration and respect. Alas, you must make do with more moderate levels of respect and admiration madam.” He says with a grin.

“Right, well my men and I will be locking everything into place and going through our pre-flight checklist.”

“Godspeed Captain.” Admiral Cistern says snapping off a salute to the volunteer and she returns it with a smile. She climbs up the ramp into the long and angular ship and he paces around it. The Ship is a pair of large wings with a cylinder inside it and a jutting forward helm with a large chunky engine on the back. Here in the Axiom and when entering an area of gravity the ship locks in the central cylinder. Within the Null and out of gravity, the cylinder rotates near endlessly leaving only the helm and engines with adjoining hallway in zero gravity.

Granted the gravity in the living quarters will not be high, but it will be high enough for considerably higher quality of life than zero gravity offers. Currently the braces are extended from the wings to lock down the rotational cylinder. It requires little energy to get it moving and with the central braces little energy to stop. The remaining four are simply to hold everything still.

The chunky engines at the back are the quad powered beasts. One of each type is all that’s needed but they not only get a pair but parts for repair or even to build a spare from scratch. This small crew of ten will go out and change the Earth almost as much as the original probe sent to them.

He examines the false head of the ship. Decorated to look like the helm and if there were any boarders they would find themselves in the trap. Right behind it and incorporated into the wings are a pair of turrets to attack into space. Its firing arcs only face forwards and backwards, but that would have to do as they could not fit more on without resorting to Axiom techniques. Ablative plating, reflective panels, solar panels, at minimum a trinity of backups for each system and should worse come to worse, the wings could be broken away from and the central cylinder could reveal hidden backup engines for emergency escape.

“Redundancies. That is the human design method. Each of our ships is designed to last longer than any other.” He says to himself then nods.

“A fair thing to be known for sir. Everyone likes a showpiece, but the foundations of all civilisations are built upon the reliable and steady.” Sir Philip remarks and he nods. They finish the little walk around of what is ostensibly the third of only five Null Resistant galactic rated shuttles. “Although being resistant to Null which is regarded with near mythic fear The Galaxy over is certainly an advantage on the market place.”

“Be honest with me Philip. The Galaxy is considered to be at a Golden Age. Are we doing the right thing bringing our chaos into it?”

“Only here in Centris and along the major Galactic Laneways is this an age of plenty and prosperity. Its included in the political summary and details I have added into the data sir.” Sir Philip says as Lance-03 slowly pulls off the ground with the Axiom Anti-Gravity drives and rises up like a phantom.

Then it’s gone in a moment. Blasting into the distance like a bird of chrome and solar panels. They would ride the largest Galactic Lanes and shut everything that uses Axiom down a full day before hitting the edge of Cruel Space and use the dismantling systems to pull them apart and bleed out further Axiom concentrations. They would then carry their momentum into the Null and use manoeuvring thrusters to adjust their course. Logistically it should take less than a week for the full travel through the Null if they could maintain the momentum.

Personally he assumed it would take a week and a half if they’re being reasonably cautious. Which they were under orders to be, they were already gone though; a no contact priority with the only hint of their passing being the numerous members of the EFL nearby along the laneways with an ear open for an emergency broadcast.

“And the rest of the Galaxy Philip?” Admiral Cistern asks after a minute of simply staring out to where Lance-03 had gone.

“Wealth and prosperity along the Galactic Lanes that lead here to Centris yet the further from the lanes the less wealth and order there is. They even have generic nicknames similar to our Null Repository of Cruel Space.” The old spy says and Admiral Cistern takes a final puff of his now depleted cigar. He flicks away the stub into a distant rubbish bin. His own slight training with Axiom caused the shot to soar with trivial ease.

“I believe I’ve heard them used in passing. Prosperous Space, Distant Space, Frontier Space and Wild Space in the order of ease of access.”

“Correct sir. Furthermore there are unique problems within each aspect. Within Centris and Prosperous Space conspiracy is the name of the day, thankfully here in the beating heart of corruption the conspiracies are so thick upon the ground they are unable to actually act. Distant Space has an extremely weak police presence and rely upon a system of high paying bounties to clamp down on the worst of law breakers. The gentlemen you have posted upon The Chainbreaker have been taking ruthless advantage of such.”

“I had noticed the unusual amount of bounties in those areas. The Frontier seems almost like America’s Old West.”

“Self governance and self reliance are the order of the day sir. I’ve spoken to a few of their representatives and the way they’re treated is either poorly or not at all. They are ignored.”

“I had noticed. Ambassador Nikti Tal speaks with me on the regular. Always seemingly shocked that I’m willing to see her.” Ambassador Cistern remarks calmly.

“Bruel is technically a Frontier World.” Sir Philip remarks before cracking a smile. “However I would also place the repeated visits on the fact that the young lady is clearly growing increasingly enamoured with you sir.”

“Could we please not? I have yet to fully come to grips with my ex-wife’s actions, let alone prepared myself for further madness.”

“Sir, the way of a woman is not the way of madness.” Sir Philip says with his smile reigned in but still present on his stoic face, somehow. 

“Let us agree to disagree.” He says taking a deep breath and rumbles into his throat. He’s developed a bit of flem off the last cigar. He’ll have to watch his smoking.

“Speaking of disagreements sir, it appears our team for smoking out conspiracy have had a very productive trip. Mister Amadi Adegoke is now married to no less than fifteen of the four armed rabbit woman who have declared themselves Rabbis. How and why a species of alien that have never so much as heard of humanity can be priests of the Jewish faith is beyond me but there we are.” Sir Philip remarks and Admiral Cistern smirks.

“Language quirks. There are only so many sounds and therefore so many combinations. Let alone two syllable words. It’s one of the least confusing parts of all this. What about the other two team members? Engineer Pike and Trooper Jackson?”

“Engineer Pike is in the process of being seduced by a praying mantis woman known as a Snict and a hydra based woman known as a Lydris, their names are Misty and Shireen respectively. His personal disgust at all things sexual is slowly losing in front of a combination of pampering affection and increasing lust.”

“I doubt it will break his unrelenting pessimism, but one can always hope.” Admiral Cistern considers as he stands at ease back into a comfortable place as he receives the report.

“Indeed sir. As to our last touch of bait he has found himself in bed with a pair of Metak sisters by the name of Nitta and Nikka. There is a high possibility of pregnancy.”

“I see... I am unfamiliar with the Metak, what are they?”

“They are categorized as Multiple, Mammalian, Omnivores. One to One Hundred Number Fifteen. At a first glance they are short blue skinned women however they have tiny shape shifting wings that are the result of Axiom endowed evolution. They are skilled in flight and appear to have evolved from some form of bat. They are often born in groups of two to five and such siblings often follow one another in all walks of life. They are known for their mobility and propensity for running messages and their natural speed and agility. Serves those in military functions well.”

“And the ones with Trooper Jackson?” Admiral Cistern asks.

“Twixt the two there is a single functioning brain, held exclusively by Nikka. Nitta is excitable, dim, and reckless. Nikka is stubborn, somewhat delusional and condescending to anyone she believes less intelligent than herself. She also has a very high opinion of her own intelligence and flagrantly disbelieves in the existence of humans.” Sir Philip says and Admiral Cistern opens his mouth to say something about that then pauses and closes it as he considers things.

“How would you profile the two hanging around Engineer Pike?”

“Misty is a desperate middle aged woman who’s very much on the hunt for her man and decided that Engineer Pike is her soon to be husband, personal decision or decency be damned, and has taken much of her seduction advice from pornography. Shireen on the other hand is a young woman boiling in her hormones and while just as desperate is hopelessly naive. She would be doing better if she didn’t misinterpret every second word as some kind of sexual innuendo and finding herself distracted. Effectively a pervert that’s doing what she can to hide things.” Sir Philip explains and Admiral Cistern almost smirks.

“Well... what’s the betting pool say about those two?”

“Current odds favour Misty by a factor of five to two due to her sheer persistence.”

“Not that the Intelligence Division has a betting pool based on the sex life of the other soldiers.” Admiral Cistern notes in an amused tone.

“Of course not sir.” Sir Philip agrees with a quickly hidden smile.

“Our last trooper?”

“The small warren of Rabbis women are effectively extended family. They’re also speaking about bringing more unmarried cousins and sisters in. There are three to two odds that by the end of the week he will be as massively married as Mister Herbert Jameson.”

“From what I understood he did ask for it.”

“He did indeed sir.”

“It’s a very odd galaxy where gossiping about my trooper’s love lives counts as a legitimate status report.” He laments somewhat.

“To be fair sir they have found nearly ten separate conspiracies despite being... occupied.” Sir Philip says with a bit of a smile. “My apprentices in Intelligence have had quite the time trying to understand how the nickname Reggie is a form of counter sign for a hired assassin. By the end of the month sheer experience will leave me with nothing to teach them.”

“And then back to retirement I take it?”

“Indeed sir. By the end of the year my replacement will be fully trained and I will be returning home.”

27,ocjfao,HFY,Sat Jul  3 00:04:16 2021,"Cafe Stardust, Chapter 5","The moment Jacob walked through the door of Krona's apartment his attention was drawn to two things; half-naked women, and a strange scent of lemons. 

The former of the two attractants not being real women, but rather just portrayals of them in Krona's apparent sizable collection of posters, figurines, and other assorted knickknacks. Most of which portrayed alien women in heroic poses dressed in stylized and sometimes provocative attire. 

Jacob initially was shocked but after looking at it all through that special reversed lens that you need to see the galaxy through. Her decor didn't seem all that different than some of the same stuff Jacob had in his apartment. Things like Conan, Rambo, or any other cheesy 80's action movies often had the protagonist in tattered clothing. Krona's stuff was just a reflection of those things. 

Secondarily, and while not as attention grabbing to Jacob as all the posters. The lemon smell quickly became the topic of conversation as Tolia stepped through the doorway herself. 

""I smell you enough at work Krona I don't need the extra dose after shift,"" Tolia said walking over to a small control panel on the wall. She pressed a button a few times causing a fan in the ceiling to whirl to life. 

The smell wasn't like lemon scented cleaner or air freshener, but rather just the smell of fresh cut lemons. It honestly smelt good to Jacob despite Tolia's harassment. It reminded him of the smell he would sometimes get off old fashioned lemon candy. *What I would give for some of that stuff*, he thought remembering its taste briefly.  

His short flash back was cutoff by a pillow flying through the air just passing his chin. 

""You know you love it bitch,"" Krona snarked as the pillow thudded against Tolia's hip pushing her into the wall. 

""Fuck, that hurt you bitch. Just because it's soft doesn't mean it doesn't hurt if you throw it hard enough, damn"", Tolia fumed back to the much larger alien rubbing her thigh while also throwing the pillow back in retaliation. 

""Well I am getting changed out of these work clothes and taking a shower before I do anything. You two throw pillows all night if you want,"" Ava said holding up a change of clothes in her hand. 

""I need to get out of these slacks after today for sure, and you need to get out of that jumpsuit Krona I don't want to smell them the whole time I'm over here,"" Tolia said following Ava through a door. 

""Jacob you can  just sit here on the couch and we will be back. Also...do...do you have a change of clothes you planned on changing into"", Krona asked strangely hesitant compared to her normal outgoing self. ""If you do you can change in there,"" she said pointing to another door.

""I don't have a change of clothes.  I hope that I won't smell to bad for Tolia,"" Jacob joked smelling himself. 

""I'll smash that cunt if she says anything to you, but I have some shorts that I think would fit you....if you wanted,"" Krona said continuing to walk to the door the other girls went through. Trying to play off the attempt to get Jacob into her clothes.

""You know, I could use different pants. These are a little to tight that is if you have anything in my size"", Jacob said gesturing to himself. 

""Really!...I mean, yeah I think I do wait here,"" Krona nearly shouted in surprise rushing down a hallway only to come back a couple of moments later with a pair of black shorts. They looked about like basketball shorts to Jacob or at least he thought they would fit him like some once he got them on. 

""Okay so once you get changed you can pick out what we are going to beat you at. I have almost everything new so pick out anything that looks interesting to you,"" Krona said in a matter fact tone leaving the room through the same door the other two went through. 

""Wait, who said you would beat me,"" Jacob hollered back but with no response. *Wait, how many showers does she have?*, he wondered to himself alone. 

..........................................................

When Krona said she had almost everything she meant it. It took him a solid minute just to scroll through her whole library, and another almost 25 to make his choice. During which time he has heard the now running shower cut off twice. Letting him conclude safely they were taking showers separately, but quickly. 

His eventual choice being a game called ""Endless Combatants 3"".  It looked like any other standard fighting game he had ever played. It had large over proportioned fighters that all seemed to have the same sort of gimmicks. Granted almost all of these fighters were women, but that was the only noticeable difference. 

Jacob even immediately honed in on the one that looked like the agile fast martial arts user type. His standard go to for pretty much every fighting game he had ever played. He even found himself  sitting on the edge of the couch in concentration trying to memorize her move set to show up Krona that he didn't even notice the girls walk in until they were basically obscuring his line of sight. 

""Fuck yeah, EC 3 I knew I saw potential in you Jacob,"" Krona blurted as she plopped down on the couch next to him already shifting through the menus to set up the first match. She had on tight bright red spandex athletic shorts and a matching sports bra both of which accented her thick wet red hair excellently. 

Her size did make him feel uneasy for a moment. Causing him to have a realization that he couldn't stop Krona. She was easily twice his size and he had seen her expand her muscles to double or triple their current size. That feeling left him no sooner than it came as he saw the child like excitement over the game on her contrastingly feminine face.

""I see you were looking at Jung's move set. She is a solid choice, maybe a little complex for your first choice though,"" Krona said in a semi-critical way. 

""Is that right,"" Jacob said challengingly. His boyish pride under attack. 

""Sorry I didn't mean it like that....I just meant.....well I just....,"" Krona struggled while shifting to face Jacob. 

""Yeah Krona, don't be so mean,"" Ava said sitting down on the other side of him nudging him lightly bringing her to his attention. 

She was wearing a white tank top and some looser baggy shorts. Where the shorts ended he could see she had a light amount of feathers on her shins that trailed down to her feet which had a slightly denser covering. They looked like they had even been shaped into cute little triangles. Looking back at her face the micro-feathers covering shifted showing maximum color as Jacob looked at her. 

*Can she control that,* Jacob pondered, caught up in the display regardless.

""Just let him play whoever Krona he might *surprise* you"", Tolia said out of his vision. 

Following her voice Jacob found Tolia was standing facing the screen hands at her hips rolling her shorts waist band up so it didn't go up higher than normal. That was only needed because she had clearly pulled them very high; to the point of showing the crease of each cheek and her thigh. 

*Fuck Becky Willows*, was all that could come to mind as Jacob watched her walk over and grab another headset from a stand. Her ass and thighs jiggling slightly with each step. She turned back walking toward them with a smile on her ever so slightly greener face. She turned in front of Jacob bending over more than needed to sit down on the floor in front of him. 

""Fine, but don't say I didn't warn you little man,"" Krona said challenging Jacob once more. Completely ignoring Tolia as she sat in front of them. 

Regardless of the fact that he found himself surrounded once again by hot aliens chicks he couldn't let that kind of challenge to his gamer-boy lifestyle stand. So he put on the VR headset  and faced Krona with a hidden grin. 

""Let the games begin."" 

...........................................................

The transition into the VR world still felt weird to Jacob. It was like having all your sense shut off and back on. For that small moment of nothing he always had the thought of if that was what death felt like. A thought always rendered moot as his senses resurrect with a flash of light and sound. 

With Sword of the Elder Dragon that transition was made calmer by Jacob always leaving the game in his characters bed. So when he went back to the game it was like waking up rather then being fucking thrusted back into the material realm all at once. EC 3 did not offer that easement. 

Jacob was blinded as his eyes took in the light all at once, and even before his vision had cleared the heat and humidity of the air had already reached an oppressive point. When he could see he looked around finding himself on a oddly cleared path in the middle of a dense jungle. His attention quickly focused on himself as he noticed his character model. 

She was hot. 

She, was Jung an Aikalon warrior based off of cultural mythology. Jacob didn't know anything about Aikalon mythology but her clothing looked like a cross between a Chinese monk and a Native American. She also had a quarter staff in one hand as her character selection screen showed. 

The sensation of having boobs he found immediately strange. He had expected them to be heavier for their size, but remembering back to the car ride, *maybe not*. He reached one hand up grabbing one giving it a small inspective squeeze, *Yep, that's what it is*, he thought to himself with a smile. 

""You done checking yourself out Jacob,"" a voice came from the sky. ""If so I am going to load in myself now."" About that time a yellow four armed giant of a woman appeared out of thin air 30 feet from him. She was holding a massive club in two of her arms behind her head in a nonchalant way.  

""So do we just start or...."", his question was never verbally answered rather the yellow monster smiled shifting the heavy club with just one arm its bulk increasing under the load. It then took several steps forward before lowering it to rest in its other arm also. 

""Guess so,"" Jacob said his voice altered to that of a Aikalon women by the game. He then took a stance that just felt right moving the quarter staff in front of himself while simultaneously lowering and centering his body. That was when the other combatant took off running. Taking two giant steps quickly followed by three more. That being all that was needed to close the distance. Once close she brought the giant club up and then down in a over head smash. 

Instinctually Jacob responded by bringing the relatively thin quarter staff up into a horizontal block in a foolish attempt to stop the massive blunt weapon. What he experienced next wasn't what he expected. He had expected to feel a acute pain followed by darkness then being back out of the game. That was what dying in the Elder Dragon was like anyway. 

No, rather as the club made contact with the staff and Jacob could feel the enormous force of the blow being transferred into his hands. The pain was dull like how if felt to be hit when drunk, but it felt kinda like getting hit in Elder Dragon but different somehow. 

He thought that he had stopped the massive club, but the pain in his hands kept growing. He thought then it was just some weird physics choice the game designers made to simulate weapon clashes. Both parties experiencing growing dull pain until one could no longer hold back the other. That was until he saw the staff crack slightly and a splinter spring off it opposite the clubs contact point. 

It moved through the air quickly but also slowly in tumbling, spinning dance barely missing Jacob's face. It was in the moment watching that splitter move that he realized he was seeing in slowed down state. 

*I’m not holding it back; I’m watching it shatter its way through.*

With that sudden understanding he attempted to evade the blow, but found that his body was not as fast as his mind. His body felt like it was moving against slime or some kind of non-Newtonian fluid.  Being held in place despite his best efforts to move it. 

As he willed it to move however it picked up speed beginning to move faster as the momentum of his body took over. It was then he also noticed the staff in his hands had shattered and the club was getting closer to his body. He twisted using his core to turn his upper body in a attempt to get out of its path. It narrowly missed his shoulder as he pulled it out of the way just as the club impacted to the left of his feet. 

The force from the impact was enough however to push him back and away. At which point time resumed its normal pace giving Jacob a sort of queasy filling. 

""So you managed to learn to control of Jung's time dilation from her move set. Most people just freak when their body doesn't move as fast as their perceptions or they get caught up watching the world move slow so they wait to long. Either way it normal would have already ended in a smashed head,” Krona stated matter of factually her voice altered to a almost snarl by the behemoth she embodied.

Jacob hadn’t learned a damn thing from the move set he barely got to look at it before she came over and started setting up the match. Plus *other* distractions didn’t make it any better. He had just lucked out reacting as fast has he could. 

*That was some fucking anime shit*, he thought a little shaky with excitement. 

“Well let’s see if you figured out how to stop this,” she said dropping the club and taking a sumo like stance. She then opened her mouth a ball of light forming in the space between her teeth quickly growing in both size and intensity. 

“THAT, is some anime bullshit”, Jacob said as the ball exploded forward completely obscuring Krona’s avatar. Time slowed then as the sound of the blast distorted dropping in pitch. 

It was already to late to move.  Jacob figured he could get half or less of his body out of the way before it hit. 

*I’ve always wanted to try this fucking shit. I just hope ole Jung works like I hope.* Jacob thought moving his legs and arms simultaneously to bring him self into the proper stance for what he intended. 

“FINAL FLASH!!!”, he screamed the sound of the Aikalon women’s words managing to just barely be audible over the roar of the blast headed his way and the new one propagating from a space just in front of were his wrists met and his hands fanned out opposite each other. 

...................................................

Jacob never even got to see any result of his efforts the world just went black and when he could see again it was through the VR headset. Taking off the headset he turned his head to face Krona. He expected to see her still in the game gloating on the screen over her victory. Instead she was also taking off her helmet with a look of confusion on her face. 

“What the fuck; how did I die”, she blurted out already playing back the match. 

“He used a ultimate,” Ava said her voice full of surprised disbelief. 

“He what!? Those aren’t in the move set. You cheated. You knew how to play Jung already,” Krona challenged facing Jacob. 

“No I swear. I don’t know anything about this game. I just thought the whole moment was very anime so I just what came to mind,” Jacob defended.

“Ani-what?,” Tolia asked shifting around facing the others on the couch now. 

“Oh sorry guess you all wouldn’t know about Anime. It’s a type of animated cartoon a lot of people on earth watch,” Jacob explained. “They usually have over the top combat scenes between powered up guys. That was what dodging the club reminded me of. Plus the mouth blast, classic anime.” 

“Human made animated EC 3 with male characters. I’m sold. I’ll get the snacks find it Jacob,” Krona demanded hopping up and disappearing into another part of the apartment. 

.................................................

After a period of time Jacob found himself watching Dragon Ball Z with Krona, Tolia, and Ava. He wasn’t sure what to show them in particular at first and it took some time to explain “Anime” wasn’t a single show. Krona eventually just demanded to see the anime that Jacob had attempted to recreate in his attack. 

So Jacob figured he would start them in the SemiPerfect Cell Saga. He had always thought that segment of “Z” had the best fights and animation in the series. Climaxing in his  favorite fight in the series between Vegeta and Cell. Which would also double to showcase his exact point of inspiration during the EC 3 match. 

He of course gave a detailed background summary that he thought Ava and for the most part Tolia had listened to. Krona on the other hand had just looked at his legs in her shorts. Jacob even found himself uncomfortable for a second when she was leaning a little trying to look up the leg of them. 

 All three of them fell in love with it immediately however Krona even more so than the other two. Jacob figured her combative nature of had to do more with that than anything. Still all three were sitting on the floor in front of the couch on massive pillows and blanks surrounded by snacks completely absorbed in it. 

Tolia and Ava had even eventually took to asking Jacob question after question about what was going on. Trying to get every piece of detail from the story, and having watched the entirety of the multi series show a couple of times Jacob was able to answer their questions without problem only causing their interest to deepen. 

It was a good thing to that Jacob was able to recall the whole show with almost encyclopedic accuracy because he had stopped watching a long while ago becoming .........*distracted*.

At first he felt kind of sleazy at just ogling over the three of them, but he would be damned if they hadn’t been eye fucking him all day. Not to mention as soon as they saw the first bits of clothing being torn off  during fights they started either knowingly or unknowingly bouncing in excitement on their pillows. Which they were sitting on cowgirl style; he was pretty sure that part at least was intentional. 

*Damn if Krona don’t fucking put Becky away to. Fuck,* Jacob thought adjusting the front of his shorts in attempt to conceal his raging hard on in case one of them turned around again. 

Her spandex shorts had also gotten pulled up in the bouncing reveling that like her tits her ass had a surprising amount of bounce. Even Ava’s baggy shorts had bunched up under her finally give Jacob a good look at her shape. He found what she did lack in the chest she compensated below the waist. 

Tolia was the hands down winner of the jiggle contest though. Her shorts riding so far up at this point she may as well had on just panties, and Jacob was pretty sure she didn’t have any of those either. Her ass had a aftershock to it when she bounced that caused almost a constant shake. A consequence of which he was yet again adjusting. 

He had to keep fixing it because it would twitch ever once in a while pulling the shorts material out reviling itself once more. Using the palm of his hand to push it back down in retaliation he found his fingers wrapping around himself. Then sliding up and stroking the head that was what brought himself back to a sudden realization of how scummy what he was doing was. 

*Gotten a little to comfy*, he thought in his lounging position. 

“I can’t get over that Vegeta is going to let cell reach his perfect state,” Ava said in a judgmental tone. “Why do that?”

“His PRIDE,” Krona defended clearly the most invested in the show and Vegeta in particular. 

“I’d fuck him,” Tolia said bluntly arching her back casing her shorts to ride up even more and her ass to wiggle with the movement. Letting upper body then slump over after the deep stretch her face slammed into the pillows causing a wave to radiate through her thighs and ass. Sending them springing up and back down in a mesmerizing display. 

“Me to,” Krona chimed in with far more excitement in her agreement while absent-mindedly still bouncing causing small repetitive ripples of her own. 

The two of which caused a massive twitch to run through Jacob. Completely undoing any kind of concealment his shorts had provided. It pulsed again pleading for other stimulation. Jacob complied only in trying to push it back into hiding but stop his hand still holding himself when he noticed Ava had been watching him. 

She put her finger up to her lips in a shushing motion then saying “I have to go to the bathroom I’ll be right back.” 

“I’m not pausing it for you,” Krona said still glued. 

“I’ll tell you what you miss Ava”, Tolia said with an edge of excitement as she sat up more growing increasingly interested as Cell perfect state was revealed. 

Ava then got up and walked instead of to the bathroom to the couch sitting down next to Jacob. She made almost no noise sitting down her body apparently being light even for it relatively smaller frame. 

“I saw you touching yourself to Tolia and Krona,” she whispered in his ear getting as close as she could without being on top of him. 

“I wasn’t I.....”

“You don’t need to explain yourself Jacob I know you like their bodies, and I know they want you to look at them. Look at Krona’s athletic tights and Tolia’s shorts they wore that stuff on purpose. I am even a little guilty of getting in that position on the pillows in front of you,” she said with a smile on her lips and feathers raising.  

Tolia and Krona even talked about which of them you were going to fuck first. Even made a little *bet*,” Ava said stressing the “T” in bet while placing her hand on Jacobs chest rubbing it lightly. Looking at him with tentative eyes until she saw no negative response from the contact. She then continued rubbing working her hand down to his stomach. 

“What sort of bet,” Jacob whispered back as softly as he could.

“Well,” she said lifting her hand and placing her fingers just under the shorts waist band. 

“They bet which one of them would make you cum first winner getting 300 credits”, she said a nervous caution on her face as she did looking for the slightest hint of negative reaction from Jacob. 

“You looking to make 300 credits,” Jacob asked. 

“Yes.....is that okay?”, she asked staring to pull her hand back perhaps thinking Jacob wasn’t interested. 

“Who would I be to stop such a lucrative venture. If you really want to th”, Jacob started to say but was cut off as Ava reached her hand down grasping his cock. 

She began stoking it starting up an then down over and over. Pulling the elastic waist band tight against him with each cycle. After a few seconds the action in the screen had reached a high point once more with the fight between Perfect Cell and Vegeta. The result being a doubling of both of Tolia and Krona’s absent minded bouncing and grinding. 

“You really like watching them don’t you Jacob. 
Which one would you have picked if I hadn’t saw you. It would have been Tolia right. I mean from back here I even have to say I would be tempted. 

Just 

Look 

At 

That 

Ass 

Shake,” she emphasized whispering in his ear pumping him in time with Tolia. 
Her wrist bending in coordination with her strokes allowing her hand to travel Jacob’s full length despite the waist bands restraint. 

“Ava your missing a good part!,” Tolia suddenly hollered forcing her bouncing to match in height with her voice. Causing Jacob to squirm the sensation building as Ava matched her. 

“You can have Vegeta Tolia I would rather have Cell,” Krona stated now watching Cell destroy Vegeta in his perfect form. 

“Your only saying that cuz he is stronger now,” Tolia  defended.  

“No, he isn’t even wearing any clothes,” Krona explained leaning herself over more like Tolia had earlier stretching her muscular back. She also spread her legs more stretching her powerful thighs further apart on top of the completely squished pillows. 

“Or maybe.....Krona,” Ava said noticing Jacob’s transfer of attention. 

Jacob turned his head looking at Ava. She was watching Krona now matching her pumps with Krona’s more slow fluid movements. 

“I might have picked you,” Jacob said airily trying to whisper through the pleasure. Ava’s head turned quickly facing Jacob’s stare. Her hand then went still in shock. Her feathers spreading on her face, arms, legs, and even feet. 

“Really?,” she asked resuming her work at a doubled effort. Causing Jacob to moan against his best efforts. Ava quickly covered his mouth stifling the noise with her other hand and ceased the hammering with the other slowing to more moderate pace. 

“Sorry about that got a little carried away. It’s just been a while, and no guy has ever picked me over Krona or Tolia.” 

Jacob looked into Ava’s eyes for a second sharing a mutual moment with her. Only for it to be interrupted by Tolia

“Jacob he is about to do the Jung ultimate isn’t he,” she asked Vegeta’s theme playing signaling the start of the dramatic charge up for Vegeta’s release. She then sat up slightly straighter pulling her already wedged shorts further purposefully teasing Jacob unaware of what was going on behind her.  

“Oh, looks like the show is getting to the part I have been waiting for,” Ava said feeling the twitch course through Jacob as Tolia released her shorts letting her ass drop down on the pillow lightly. 

“Better get this out don’t want you making a mess in Krona’s shorts. She would *never* forgive me if I let a guy get her shorts messy.”

She then pulled the shorts up pulling Jacob out into full view. Taking a good look at it as she pumped it a few more times. 

“Fuck, I wanted this so bad,” was the last and only thing Ava said after seeing it before lowering her mouth down and taking him all the way inside. Her tongue was long and thin which Jacob immediately found a little weird but only for a second. That was when it started stroking him from inside covered in her saliva. 

She then began sucking and bobbing her head building with the intensity of the moment on screen. Her tongue was long and thin wrapping around more as it was trying to tease out its reward. 

Jacob felt it in the base first that familiar sensation of his climax building up ready to erupt. The sucking of Ava and the pseudo strip tease he was getting from Tolia and Krona both overwhelming his ability to hold out any longer. 

“FINAL FLASH,” Vegeta roared releasing his blast at the same moment as Jacob. He quickly found one of Ava’s hands over his mouth clamping his mouth shut with surprising force compared to what she had displayed so far. It did stop Jacob’s moan from escaping his mouth which was the desired effect. The other hand now  pumping in tandem with her tongue drawing out every last spasm from Jacob. 

The movement in the room stopped as the action slowed in the moment of believed victory. Jacob could feel in his afterglow two swallows. Then a bolt of overstimulation rang through him in unison with audible POP as the vacuum left behind in Ava’s mouth filled with her release. 

Tolia and Krona both turned seeing Ava cleaning her lip and Jacob still throbbing in pleasured pain. 

“Don’t worry girls I’ll pay for food with some of my 300 credits,” Ava said a her feathers flared to a maximum in victory.

# Chapter 8: School Hell Week the 1st. AKA Mid-Terms

It had been a week since the attack at the hotel. Alice had seen a therapist every morning before class. She was still a little shook up but was feeling more and more confident as the days went on. Navy had a home game the previous day and won in triple overtime. John was in the cafeteria having breakfast.

“Enough bacon?” Alice sat down next to John. She kissed him on the cheek.

“This is another thing they make well. And it’s so crispy.” John was overly excited about the bacon.

“Hey, what are you doing for Thanksgiving next month?” 

“No plans, probably stay here for the week.”

“Nope, you’re coming home with me. And you don’t get to say no to that.”

“Aye aye mam.” He saluted her. John liked her idea, though meeting her family did present a different type of challenge.

Alice put her tray down and lightly elbowed him after sitting down next to John. Andern ambled into the cafeteria. If they didn’t know any better, he looked like a zombie.

“Was he out all night?” John laughed as he pointed out Andern to Alice.

“Heard there was a party at the Drunken Cadet after the game. MPs got called in to disburse the crows not too long ago.” Alice was poking at a pancake. 

Andern placed a cup of coffee in front of them. Then set his head on the table and started snoring. Alice and John laughed together. He was in for a world of hurt today.

“He’d be better off drinking a bunch of water, get some food in his stomach and go for a good workout. But instead, he’s going to be here for 3 hours sleeping and drinking coffee and just making that hangover last all day.”

“John, did you want to go off base for lunch?”

“Sure thing, you got a place in mind?”

“Yeah, I was thinking Valencia’s or Paolo’s.” Alice was poking Andern with a butter knife.

“Sounds good.”

Jessica was the next to sit down. She looked in as rough of shape as Andern.

“Oh my god. Did the two of you have drunken sex last night?” Alice blurted out.

“Not so loud. Head hurts.” Jessica was staring at her coffee. “And no, we were at the Cadet. We stayed all night.”

“Well, I’m off the gym. Alice, you coming?” John grabbed his plate as he got up.

“Yup, lead the way big guy!”

“Where am I?” Andern picked his head up. He was sobering up.

“Good luck you two, be strong.” John said as they were heading to the gym.

The gym was pretty quiet. After a couple hours of working out, combined with a fair amount of flirting and a little grab ass play the two had called an end to the workout. They opted to swing by the cafeteria just to see if their friends were still there.

“Oh my god. Everyone is hung over.” Alice was both shocked and appalled. She wasn’t above drinking but drinking all night long didn’t seem like a good use of one’s time. She poked John and pointed at Jess and Andern.

“Oh, I am taking a picture of this.” John ran over and took a picture on his phone of Jessica and Andern leaning against one another.

“Looks like a war was fought yesterday.” Kevin said as he sat down at the other end of the table. Nathan was devouring the bacon he had grabbed.

“Football game, they beat Clemson.” John said.

“What?” Kevin replied. Sports were not Kevin’s deal.

“Sportsball Kevin. Have a good one.” John waved at Kevin and Nate and headed to his room. Alice was coming with him. When they got back to his room clothes were torn off one another. They needed to get cleaned up, but they needed to burn off some pent up sexual tension that was lingering in the air for the past week. They lost out on a golden opportunity because of the hotel attack. Today they weren’t going to pass it up. 

Monday morning

The group was in John’s room studying. No tests were held on Monday. The first of 2 midterms per class were to be completed by Wednesday. The PT test could be taken any time during the week. The second and third were due by Friday. The tests were random for each student, so one pick and choose when to take tests within reason. 

“So, what’s your plan of attack John?” Andern was trying to learn via osmosis.

“PT after chow. Depending on how long it takes, take all 12 of my first tests tomorrow, worst case scenario be done by Wednesday morning.”

“You suck but you know that dear. I’ll be doing the PT exam with you today.” Alice kind of rolled her eyes at her lover. She wasn’t usually jealous of that memory of his, but this week she’d kill for that ability.

Jessica looked up from her book and eyed John. “How the hell are you taking that many tests at once. And why aren’t you studying?”

“Well, I’m ready for the tests.” John just shrugged.

“Name the captain who was responsible for ending the pirate attacks outside of Terra Nova?” Andern muttered.

“Commander Jessik. Strictly speaking it was in the Terra Nova system that the final pirate attack happened, but his squadron was based out of Terra Nova.”

Andern and Jessica were eyeing him suspiciously. John was nonchalantly chewing on a pen and flipping through the different ESPN channels trying to find something half interesting or competitive on. He settled on RC Car racing on the Ocho.

Jessica and Andern began rapid firing questions on any subject to him. Alice joined in because it looked fun. She knew the secret and decided to use that perfect recall of his to help her study.

“What Captain was largely responsible for forming frigate wing formations against Alliance military?” Andern asked. He purposefully messed up the question.

“Admiral Chester. Wasn’t a captain or the alliance, it was the Mercantilists. Page two, third column, fourth entry on the study guide.” John winced at the video that was on TV, the race car driver apparently crashed a 1/5 scale plane recently. That looked expensive.

“Ok, full stop. We’ve been studying basically since last night. You’ve done fuck all since then. How do you know all that?” Jessica was flustered. She understood most things and was in the top 20% of the class but this was too much.

“Huh? I thought y’all knew?”

“Honey I do, they don’t.” Alice smiled.

“You two are really comfortable with one another. Like way more than normal.” Andern was taken off subject.

“Ignore that question. John, answer my damn question.” Jessica was now angry that he was exhibiting precisely no effort towards midterms. Now that she had a moment to think, he showed precisely no motivation in studying besides reading a book. But she’s trying to remember whether or not he’s ever picked up and looked at the same book a second time.

“I have an eidetic memory.”

“You shot who in the what now?” Andern interrupted.

“Photographic memory. I remember everything I’ve seen, read, or understood. So, book tests are rather simplistic for me.”

“I hate you.” Andern and Jessica said in unison.

The group got back to studying. Peppering John with questions, who then answered them immediately as he was laying on the floor watching RC Cars race on TV. 3 hours later it was about time to head to chow. John got up, walked into his room and changed into some more comfortable clothes for PT. The group were packing up books and began walking down the hall.

“So, you ok with meeting up after dinner. You room?” Andern asked.

“No problem.” John was just going with the flow. He pressed floor 2 on the number pad and the elevator was taking them down to the cafeteria floor.

Lunch came and went. It was fish and chips day. After that Alice and John completed their PT mid-terms. Nothing overly difficult. 5k run, pull ups, pushups, sit ups, and a couple wall climbs. John essentially matched his times he set when the semester started. Alice showed a general improvement across all workouts except for the wall climb. They were walking back to John’s room. 

John opened the door and Alice started to strip. “I’m taking a shower now.”

“So am I.” John was a sweaty and smelly mess. This was one of those times where ladies first could be applied. Be he didn’t want to wait for a shower. And he suspect she didn’t want to wait any longer than they needed to be together.

The shower sex was awkward. It isn’t always awkward, but his shower wasn’t terribly large. All the studying for the tests were being overly stressful for Alice. She needed this release. Besides, she wasn’t one to pass over an opportunity to have sex with John.

After the shower dalliance they sat back down at the table and began to study again. Well Alice did. John was just flipping through a book looking incredibly bored. Jessica and Andern wound up in the room before chow. Jessica noticed Alice glowing and smirked. She sat next to her and whispered something to Alice that turned her 10 different shades of red. 

Tuesday

The cafeteria hall was quiet and tense despite nearly being full. Alice, Jessica and Andern were immersed in various books and picked at food. John looked fully bored and just focused on his plate of eggs and bacon.

Kevin and Nathan walked in late and out of breath. Looked like they took the early morning PT test.

“Morning, how’d it go?” John asked.

“Cold as balls. Barely passed the pull up bar, could hardly hold onto the damn thing.” Kevin turned back to his food and was devouring it. 

“At least it’s done though.” John said. Nate and Kevin just nodded in agreement. 

Andern and Jessica planned to do the PT test after they take the first 2 mid-terms this morning. John wondered why they didn’t just take a break from studying and get the PT portion done with when Alice and he had done it.

“John where are your tests this morning?” Jessica asked, her eyes not leaving the study guide she was scanning over.

“Nimitz building, discussion hall. Naval Tactics and Officer Leadership are in the same room. Physics, calc and station management are in the Welsh room on the third floor.”

“So, your there the whole day?” Alice asked.

“Yup, no lunch chow for me. 8 straight hours of tests. Gonna try and talk my professors into taking the second and third tests if I can finish them up early.”

“John, you’re my friend, but right now I hate you.” Andern looked up, then looked back at his study guide.

John stood up and was getting his stuff together. As he walked by the table, he wish them all best of luck. They agreed to meet up for dinner at 18:00.

John walked alone to Nimitz hall, found the discussion hall and took a front row seat. The professor walked in. Activated the cadet’s terminals and the first test was available to take. 200 questions were on the test. You need to answer 50 correct without exceeding a failure rate of 30%. The test was scheduled for 2 hours. Most students should finish it in 90 minutes. John was done in 18 minutes.

“Excuse me Professor.” John said barely above a whisper.

“Go ahead Cadet.”

“Is it possible to take the second and third mid-terms now as well?”

He laughed quietly. “I don’t see why not, you’ve certainly got the time to take them. I’ll reactivate your terminal.” The professor clicked a few buttons on his terminal, then saw John’s first test score. 50/50. He had never seen a student finish a test that quickly or accurately before. Nor did he ever see a student come to a mid-term or final without bringing their book bag into the room. Letting him take the other tests wasn’t going to hurt.

And true to form 18 minutes later the second test was a 50/50. 17 minutes later the third test was done. Also perfect.

“Thank you sir, see you next week.” John quickly saluted and headed out of the room.

John checked his schedule, it was time to call an audible. For the rest of the day, he bounced around from room to room taking tests when he could. By 15:00 all his tests were done. He was annoyed that he had a test on his calc test marked down 1 point. 

John was walking outside of the Nimitz building and saw Alice walking back to the dorms. “Alice, how have the tests gone?”

“Good, three tests down, nothing worse than a 90%.” Her smile showed a great sign of relief. “I’m doing the same thing as you, I’m going to take another test at 16:00 and like 4 more tomorrow. Finish up the remaining tests Thursday morning. Perfect scores for you?”

“Trick calc question, ended up having 1 point deducted.”

“Your sullen and annoyed for finishing with a 99%? Honey, my heart bleads for you. Oh hey, gotta run into the library to study a bit before the next test.” She stood on her tip toes to give him a kiss. “See you at dinner!”

Wednesday afternoon

John went to the gym to get a workout in. Everyone else was busy coming and going. Nerves were a bit frayed here and there but he tried to help wherever he could. Because he was left to his own devices, he got incredibly bored. He didn’t really want to drink, there was going to be plenty of that next week.

He decided to hit the weights hard that day. He was doing 4x10s with 450 pounds of weight for his squats. 5x8s bench press with 350 pounds on the bar. 4x10x clean and jerk with 300 pounds on the bar. There were some football players watching him do this work out. They came over and talked with him about halfway through his workout.

John did some cool down exercises with some dumb bells. After about an hour and a half in the gym he was calling it good and opted to head back to his dorm to clean up. He said goodbye to the football upper classmen that he was chatting with and left the gym.

He had gotten about halfway back to the dorms when he heard. “Cadet Lief, a moment of your time please.”

John turned to his right and saw a gentleman standing next to a Mercedes limousine. Looked like a driver to some rich person. He nodded and walked over. The man opened the door and he heard a voice inside the car. “Please take a seat.”

He sat down and across from him were 2 older gentleman. Both appeared to be retired military, one appeared to be in his 70s and the other in his later 40s or early 50s. He knew exactly who they were. 

“We haven’t been introduced.” The older one said.

“No need sir. Retired Admirals James T. Daniels and retired Captain Timothy R. Daniels. It doesn’t exactly take a lot of deduction to determine what you want to chat about.”

“I had heard you were a blunt object that the Navy has used in the past.” Timothy had a condescending attitude toward John.

“Naval Intelligence, I work for the Navy proper now and for the foreseeable future.” John corrected him. 

“You did our family a great disservice by disseminating the reports on Donnely’s folly.” James said.

“You mean the Daniels mistake. Neither of you two were involved in the coverup and as such aren’t responsible for the sins of your forebearers. To continue calling that incident Donnely’s folly is an insult to a man that served the Navy with distinction and honor. Your predecessors destroyed a good man to coverup their own fuck up.”

“Now you listen here.” Timothy lost the condescending attitude and was visibly angry.

“No, you listen to me. This conversation is over. Make a move on me and I promise you I will find a way to absolute destroy your family’s now diminished name. Your both intelligent and well-connected men. This discussion is beneath both of you.” John opened the door and got out. He poked his head back in. “Tim, you likely didn’t have clearance on me, your father did. He knows what I’m capable of. You would do well to move past this quickly, I’m not the kind of man that appreciates being attacked.”

He smiled at the men and shut the door as he headed back to his dorms. The older Daniels wasn’t going to do anything rash or stupidf. The younger one had shades of Paul Daniel in his personality. He would likely be a problem. He began running some threat assessments in his head and figured out a few ways to attack him directly without making the retired admiral collateral damage.

Thursday Morning.

The tests were finally over. The group crammed and decided to take the approach of get everything taken as quickly as possible. Not quite as fast as John did but they weren’t Martians like he was.

The same routine happened through Thursday. Alice had just two tests to finish up midterms on Thursday morning. She didn’t score worse than 94% in any of them. Solidly cementing her in the top 15 cadets in their class. 

Jessica scored between 85 and 90% but aced her Engineering classes. She was in the top 50 to 60 cadets. She was really pleased with the results but felt like they spent too much time studying. Alice had agreed with her

Andern didn’t score worse than 80% but it looked like it was a mighty struggle the whole time. He spent too much time early in the year not studying and was clearly behind the curve. Luckily with all these tests he was caught up and finally improving his position in the class.

It had been a stressful week for all of them.  Well, not John, he was very nonplussed about the week’s happenings. Despite the stress everyone else felt, spirits were hopeful and happy. But everyone was focused on one thing, fall break. Now it was time for a vacation!

51,odx3qn,HFY,Mon Jul  5 04:19:34 2021,Sex Ed: Chapter 1 | SSBverse,"Tonight's client was another Interior agent, a big lass, too. The job description mentioned she wanted the full package: flirting and drinks, a massage, and then sex. Luiz stretched his arms overhead, cracking his back as he yawned. It was going to be a busy night.

The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as he drove to work. The parlour was hidden discreetly behind an expensive fabrics store which served as a front. Most patrons would enter via the security door around the back alley, but Luiz used the store's garage for some anonymity. Keying in his code he made his way through darkened corridors to the backstage, a series of rooms where fellow employees could shower and ""freshen up"" before meeting clients. His room held a few personal belongings, toiletries, and clothing.

A hot shower and shave had him feeling more awake. No matter how many times he'd done this before, some nerves always made a small knot in the bottom of his stomach. They would settle eventually, especially once he got into the swing of things. This was a job he genuinely enjoyed.

Applying some cologne and selecting his outfit for the evening, he finished combing his hair. Looking himself once over in the mirror, he nodded at his reflection and stepped back out into the corridors.

""Hello, handsome,"" an effeminate voice called from an open door. Stopping at the doorway, Luiz looked inside to see a slight man languidly splayed on a couch in a silk robe.

""My goodness, which lucky purp has got you this evening?"" The man said with a mischievious grin.

Luiz snickered. ""Hey Pickle. Some agent, her first time.""

""Well, she's in for a treat! What do you reckon, is she gonna take the lead, or are you gonna make her purr like a kitty?""

""We'll find out. How about you?""

""Oh honey, I'm always working. You know me, those purps love a delicate man."" Pickle winked as he spoke, trailing a hand across his bared chest.

This time Luiz let out a laugh. ""They have no idea what they're in for. How many of them do you actually top?""

Pickle's expression was deadpan. ""I top them all.""

Luiz laughed as he waved his friend goodbye. Reaching the parlour centre he stepped out into the main room. It was dimly lit, soft music playing in the background. A bar was set against the back wall, with booths and seats scattered around the room. At the counter an old lady sat, smoking out of a cigarette holder. The cliche was almost too funny, but Selina - Madame Woo - had enough gravitas to pull it off.

""You look good, boy. Ready for tonight?"" She asked as she checked him over. Her voice carried a Chinese accent and her face was lined with wrinkles. She carried herself with poise and looked refined.

""Yes, Madame,"" Luiz said, kissing her on each cheek.

""New girl tonight. Sounds like she's a bit inexperienced, so play it how you feel.""

""Of course. Busy night?""

Madame Woo nodded. ""Yes. You'd think those insurgent attacks would keep our clients away, but they get more horny because of it. Need to relieve some stress.""

Luiz nodded, pulling out his omnipad and looking at the file of his client. A detailed account of her interests were shown, including her weight and height.

""She's big. You going to have your work cut out for you, huh?"" Madame Woo shot at him.

He grinned back. ""Nah, she'll be a happy lady by the end of the night. Room five, yeah?""

""Yes, it's all set up. First guests will be arriving in half an hour, yours is at eight.""

""Thanks Madame Woo. I'll see you later.""

Luiz returned to his room. He selected some music on his pad to help prepare. Some sultry blues started to play and he felt his body relax.

Not for the first time he reflected on the unique position he was in: a prostitue for rich Shil'vati. It wasn't what he'd imagined he'd be doing for a job, but no one could in this post-alien invasion world. The pay was excellent and, well, he liked fucking Shil'vati. He found them just as sexy and exotic as they seemed to find him.

Soon enough his pad chimed, letting him know his client was here. Putting on his waistcoat he made his way back out to the main room.

It was now filled with more people. He spotted Pickle nestled between two Shil'vati women. They were completely enraptured with him, hanging on to his every word. They laughed at his jokes, pressing their huge breasts against the small man. Pickle met Luiz's gaze and winked.

Luiz took a seat at an empty booth. He received several glances from other Shil'vati in the room but most were preoccupied with their ""dates."" Some were already being escorted to their private rooms, giddy with excitement. The air was alive with sexual tension.

A human women with brown hair approached him and spoke in Shil'vati. ""Excuse me, Luiz? This is your date tonight, Miss La'ryxis.""

Luiz stood up to greet a tall Shil, possibly the tallest he'd seen, dressed in a jaw-dropping black dress. It looped around her neck leaving her purple back bare, while plunging over her huge breasts which spilled out on either side. The dress was split along her left leg, revealing her skin all the way up to her hip. Luiz noticed she was also in heels, further adding to her huge stature.

""Thank you Olivia,"" Luiz replied to the wait staff. Olivia smiled at him and returned to the foyer. ""La'ryxis, I'm Luiz,"" he said, extending his fist for a bump. She blushed and returned the gesture.

""Would you like to join me?"" He asked, giving her a winning smile. She blushed even more as she lowered herself onto the seat next to him. ""This will be fun,"" he thought.

\*\*\*

La'ryxis was nervous. She couldn't believe what was about to happen. Finally, she was getting laid! It had been too long, working on a planet surrounded by men and not getting any dick. Empress, how she'd nearly broken her vibrator in anticipation of fucking a human.

She'd first heard about the parlour from her superior. Having received a promotion for her work stifling a potential insurgent attack, her senior officer had quietly slipped her the details.

The parlour was known only to the rich and the powerful. Visiting noblewomen or Interior agents with enough clout were the only ones who could really afford the services. La'ryxis thanked her good fortune for signing on with the Interior and not joining the marines like her sister.

She'd decided to go all out; there was a dress code, afterall. She'd scoured the net for fashion advice, wanting to gleam what would attract the human male gaze. Shil'vati apparel was fortunately being manufactured on Earth now, and she'd spent a fair sum of money on this dress. Looking at her reflection in her residence, she'd nodded in approval. All her best features were accentuated: smooth, lilac skin, large breasts spilling out the sides forming irresistible cleavage, her muscular shoulders and back in plain view, the dress snug over her stomach, waist and hips, which curved sensuously down to her legs. Her thighs and buttocks were defined, thick and powerful.

Her white hair hung in twisting coils over her right shoulder. Her tusks were freshly polished, above her proud jawline and high cheekbones. Looking at her reflection she felt strong and a ravenous instinct for sex surged through her.

She took her private transport (perks of the job) into town, her guard dropping her off at the alleyway entrance. As she neared the parlour entrance her nerves suddenly shot up as reality set in. She was going to get laid! She had poured over the entry form when signing up. She had marked herself down for the full service - it had been so long since she'd really treated herself - and had paid for one of the highest ranked workers they had. An odd policy, but there were no images of her ""date"" available. She'd had to complete a questionnaire which asked very personal questions, such as whether she was a ""dom"" or ""sub."" These weren't familiar terms, but the questionnaire had explained the terms in detail. The thought of a male taking charge in the bedroom had been... breathtaking, to say the least. Uncertain which drew her more she had marked undecided.

She rapped on the door once, which opened to a small security area. A short, muscular man stood inside, and La'ryxis swallowed hard at the sight of him. His hair was cut short across his head and hair covered his jaw, a strange oddity unique to human men. His ""beard"" (as she recalled the name) was tidy and short, similar to the hair on the top of his head. He wore a white collar shirt which bulged across his muscular arms. She spied some tattoos creeping up the side of his neck.

""Good evening, miss,"" the man spoke in perfect Shil'vati. ""My name is Amos. Do you have your entry code, please?""

La'ryxis typed the code into the omnipad Amos handed her. A beat passed while he worked on the pad before he looked up with a smile. ""Thank you, Miss La'ryxis. I understand this is your first time?""

La'ryxis nodded quietly, overwhelmed by the confidence of this small male. She swallowed hard.

""This way please,"" Amos said, opening the next door. ""Olivia will take you to the parlour now to meet your date. Thank you, Olivia.""

La'ryxis flashed Amos a smile as she passed, tearing her eyes off his arms. Goddess, if all the men in this establishment were dressed half as well as this one she didn't know how she'd contain herself.

The human women, Olivia, smiled and bowed slightly to her. ""This way please,"" she said, leading her on. They passed down a well lit corridor with gracious decor, before arriving at the parlour lounge. La'ryxis' heart caught in her throat as she looked around. The place was *thriving*. Many Shil'vati women like herself were dressed in their best, all accompanied by handsome, sexy men. The men wore tailored suits of various colours and styles, but to the last man they were well dressed.

There was a palpable thrum in the air, of conversation and laughter, and the deep bass of sexual desire. La'ryxis felt a warmth spread from her centre, as she stood mouth slightly agape. Her hips ground together on their own as she felt herself get wet.

Hardly aware of what was happening, she caught the tail end of her guide speaking.

""...This is your date tonight, Miss La'ryxis.""

La'ryxis' eyes nearly bulged from her skull. Before her stood a man, the most beautiful man she'd ever seen. He wore a black waistcoat over a white shirt that was tailored for a close fit. But it was his eyes that captivated her the most - as they were nearly level with her own. La'yrxis was tall, even for Shil'vati. Most male Shil were very small by comparison. Not that this had been a problem; she liked small men. They were cute and fragile, and it made her femininity roar with satisfaction when she wrapped her arms around them. But this human stood only a head shorter than her. It was an exhilerating feeling to be next to someone of the opposite sex who was nearly her height.

She noticed his eyes were a dark brown, and almond shaped, as she'd learned it was called on Earth. His cheek bones sat high, and his jawline rivaled hers. His face was framed by black locks of hair, and as he looked at her he smiled. The smile reached all the way to his eyes, which crinkled at the corners.

""Goddess,"" she thought, knees growing weak. He had moved closer now and she caught a whiff of his cologne. Her knees nearly buckled.

""Thank you, Olivia,"" she heard him say. She barely noticed as Olivia departed quietly. ""La'ryxis, I'm Luiz."" He extended his fist and after a moment sorting her coordination she managed to return the bump. ""Would you like to join me?""

He had moved to her side and drawn the seat out for her. She was taken aback slightly. Empress above, where had her bloody tits gone? This man had her completely entranced. He took her hand as she lowered herself onto the chair and felt her cheeks flush with embarrassment. His hand was warm and she lingered in his hold.

Suddenly he was seated next to her. He sat with such casual grace. He was relaxed and fully in control. This was a most unusual feeling. She ground her crossed legs together as her thong became saturated.

\*\*\*

""Wow,"" Luiz thought. ""She's beautiful.""

""You're beautiful,"" he said aloud. La'ryxis went a shade darker, if it were possible. She mumbled her appreciation before returning the compliment. Luiz laughed and his laugh sent tingles up her spine.

""Thank you, La'ryxis. I understand this is your first time here. My apologies to talk business straight away, but I'd like to be clear and upfront: we have agreed upon a safe word should there be any discomfort and we need to pause activities. I'm sure the occasion will not arise, and no doubt any misunderstandings will be promptly cleared up. Could you please clearly state tonight's safeword?""

""S-sunstone,"" La'ryxis said. Safewords had been a novel concept for her, but the parlour had been adamant of their use. Abusing the rules would be punished by immediate termination of their services and no sane women would dare run the risk.

""Lovely, thank you. Now, we have a long night ahead of our selves, why don't we get to know one another? May I get you a drink?""

""Yes, please.""

""Excellent.""

Luiz brought up the electronic menu on the table.

""How do you feel tonight? What kind of mood are you in?""

The question was almost too much for her to bear.

""Excited?"" She hazarded a guess. ""And nervous,"" she added with a slight grin.

Luiz shot her a warm look and gently laid his hand on her arm. It sent shivers across her skin and she looked down at his hand. It was large and veiny. His tendons rippled under his brown skin and she couldn't help but imagine that same hand caressing her breasts or fingering her.

""Excited and nervous. Perfect, let's try this.""

He tapped a few options into the screen which sent the order to the bar. The barman started making the drinks.

Luiz leaned back in his seat, one arm cocked over the back. ""So, how long have you been on Earth?""

La'ryxis cleared her throat. ""About three Earth years, now.""

""Have you had a chance to travel much outside of the city?""

""No, my work keeps me busy.""

""Of course. Well, if you ever get time off, there are some beautiful places on this planet.""

""Yes, I've been researching about them!"" La'ryxis said excitedly. ""I've been watching human travel documentaries on the datanet - you're such a diverse species!""

Luiz laughed again. ""Yes, we are. What places have grabbed your attention so far?""

""The tropical islands remind me of home. Beaches and warm sunsets. But I've also found myself intrigued by your snowy environments. The cold on this planet is... difficult for us,"" she finished.

""Yes, I understand your bodies enjoy warmer climates,"" Luiz replied. These words fueled the flame between her legs.

""True. But I find the snow quite enchanting. And your snow sports look exhilarating! I'd love to try snowboarding, I think it's called?""

""Really? You're the first Shil I've met who has any interest in that.""

Their conversation was briefly interrupted as the barman brought their drinks over.

""Thanks, Leon,"" Luiz said. The barman nodded and left.

""What are we drinking?""

""This is a special concoction. Vodka with a dab of honey and ginger. It's got quite a kick and will help turn those nerves into something more... productive."" Luiz smirked as he said that last bit. La'ryxis smiled into her glass as she brought the drink to her lips. Fire tasted in her mouth and burned down her throat. She spluttered, but once it settled she found the sensation thrilling.

""This is very good! What is ginger?""

""A spice; we use it in lots of dishes. I'm glad you like it.""

He raised his glass and they clinked their glasses together.

""To a fun night and getting to know each other,"" he said. La'ryxis smiled back.

\*\*\*

As the evening progressed, La'ryxis found herself unwinding. Months of tension melted off her shoulders, the hard work she'd been putting in finally relinquishing the stress on her body. She laughed freely with Luiz. He was charming and warm, and while she knew this was a paid arrangement, she felt he was genuinely interested in her. She was aware of the constant shivers that ran up her body when he touched her while telling a story, or when he gazed at her with his full attention.

She told him the basics about her family and her childhood. She had inquired gently about his, and was delighted when he had been forthcoming about his own background. He discussed growing up back in South America, his family, and his leisure pursuits. He was careful not to give away too much personal information, but she appreciated his candour.

She noticed he artfully steered the conversation away from topics like the invasion and human dissent. While he encouraged her to talk about work, it was only about the general stresses of the job. It felt good to bitch about work and have a beautiful man placate her. She felt heard.

Plucking up the courage she had asked him how he had landed his current job. Luiz had laughed in that carefree manner of his and explained he had done some modelling work prior.

""Madame Woo contacted me first. When she explained the details I was surprised but keen. I think most human men, if they're being really honest, find Shil'vati women *very* attractive. I do. It was kind of a dream come true. Plus, I think the most amazing thing is I get to meet aliens - real aliens! It's incredible. Humanity has finally met an alien species and we're similar in so many ways!""

Luiz's sudden enthusiasm and childish delight was infectious. La'ryxis found her chest start to tighten as they eagerly shared more about their species and culture.

""Your Shil is very well spoken,"" she said.

""Thank you! Madame Woo made it a requirement for hire. It wouldn't do to rely on translators to get to know each other.""

He flashed her another smile and her heart skipped a beat. Handsome, charming, and well spoken... She couldn't wait to see what other qualities he possessed.

\*\*\*

Eventually Luiz recommended they progress to the next stage of the evening's affairs. This reignited the nerves in La'ryxis' stomach. Luiz stood and held his arm out to take hers. She didn't feel his feminine behaviour condescending, rather it elicited an excitement from her at the strangeness of such bold, unmanly behaviour from a male.

He walked her down another corridor, where they passed several doors. Luiz opened one with a number five carefully painted on the centre. He stood to the side and ushered her in politely. La'ryxis let out a small gasp. The room was beautifully tailored with neutral tones and soft lighting. An elegant massage table was already set up in the centre, with a large bed off to the side. Another open door revealed a tiled bathroom, and what La'ryxis suspected was a huge bath. The air was subtly perfumed, and various flowers decorated the wall shelves.

""After your long hours at work would you care to properly relax? There are some towels in the bathroom if you'd like to undress. I'll wait here.""

Suddenly La'ryxis' sexual desire came raging back. Should she strip in front of him, here and now? She settled on playing the game Luiz had set. He was the host after all but she decided to be bold and left the bathroom door open. While she undressed she caught Luiz gazing at her reflection from the corner of his eye. She smiled, intentionally bending over to place her clothes in a linen basket. Her back muscles stood proud as she leaned over, her round buttocks forming the most perfect peach-shaped ass Luiz had ever seen. Her swollen pussy was nestled in between her cheeks, her inner thighs already slick with her anticipation. ""He better be enjoying the view,"" she thought.

She wrapped herself in a large white towel and walked back out. Luiz had taken off his waistcoat and rolled his sleeves up. ""Goddess,"" she moaned to herself. His forearms were corded with muscles and veins, like his hands. The rolled up sleeves did something to accentuate the power in his hands and she could feel herself dripping more profusely.

""Please, La'ryxis, lie down on your stomach.""

She did as he bade, her face comfortably nestled in the hole at the top of the table. She felt Luiz adjust her towels, which sent a thrill of excitement then exasperation as it only exposed her back - her buttocks were still covered. ""Would he have seen my wet cunt?"" She thought.

Soft music started to play while she felt Luiz move around the table.

""I'm going to be using some oils to massage you tonight. They do wonders for the skin,"" he said.

She heard him uncork one bottle, and moments later his strong hands had started smearing the oil across her back. She let out a loud, involuntary groan as he did this which she stifled with embarrassment.

""It's okay, La'ryxis. Tonight is just for us. I want you to completely relax, you don't have to put up any pretenses.""

As his hands worked steadily at relieving the tension in her muscles, La'ryxis felt her mind drift into a state of bliss. Luiz's hands danced down her back, her pliable lilac skin undulating under his exquisite touch. He followed the contours of her body, gently working the muscles until they felt like putty in his hand. She groaned contentedly.

""You have a beautiful back, La'ryxis."" Her eyes snapped open at this. ""I love the shape of your muscles, too. I'm always amazed at how strong you Shil'vati are.""

La'ryxis felt her cunt start to throb with pleasure at the compliment. If she were to get up from the table there would be a noticeable wet patch.

""You humans aren't too bad, either,"" she replied.

""Oh, really?"" Luiz asked with a flirtatious tone.

His hands worked lower and lower, kneading the top of her pelvis, just above her pert buttocks. She was groaning more regularly now, her breathing labored. Just as she was hoping his hands would slip under the towel, she instead felt him start massaging her calves. Not that she could complain, it felt heavenly.

Slowly he worked back up her legs, massaging her hamstrings and inner thighs. She bit her lip at the thought of his hands sliding over the juices on her leg, now mixed in with the oil. Inch by inch his hands circled further upwards. La'ryxis' breathing became laboured at the nearness of his hands to her cunt. His fingers slid under the towel, now mere inches from her outer lips. Blood pounded in her loins, her body aching to be touched at her centre.

Just as she was certain he would finally touch her, his hands slid away, following the curve of her glutes. He began massaging her pert buttocks instead and she let out an exasperated groan. It was a torturous pleasure!

""Enjoying yourself?"" Luiz asked.

""Yes!"" La'ryxis replied through clenched teeth.

""You'll be satisfied soon, just enjoy the moment,"" he replied. This man was going to be the death of her.

Pleasure began to overwhelm her as Luiz's hands massaged her buttocks. By kneading both cheeks at the same time her cunt was indirectly stimulated, as it was gently squished together. She could feel her lips part then seal, juices dripping everywhere. The towel now lay forgotten, having slipped off her prone form.

Luiz ran his hands the length of her body, from her calves, up across her buttocks and up her back. As he neared her shoulders and neck he gently massaged the base of her skull, before sliding his hands all the way back down and repeating the process. She shuddered at his administrations.

""Nearly ready,"" he thought to himself. Luiz had given her the best massage he could. It was quite easy as he enjoyed turning Shil'vati women to putty under his hands. For all their big talk and swagger they sure could be brought down a peg when it came to sex. Finishing the last of his massage he stopped, and gave her a playful slap on the ass.

""There, how was that?""

She raised herself on shaky arms to stare at him. He stood in front of her, leaning casually against the wall, wiping his hands dry with a towel, a cheeky grin across his face.

""You,"" she uttered, shakily getting off the table. Her face was flushed, her large tits swinging with her movement. He openly admired the sight, especially the curves around her waist. Her toned stomach creased beautifully at the hips and strands of grool clung between her thighs. He couldn't wait to taste her.

""You, human, cannot be real. That was incredible. I. Want. You. Now!"" She staggered towards him, punctuating each word. Lust overcome her completely. As she seized him, intending to push him onto the bed and mount him, she found herself suddenly pressed up against the wall. Her arms were being held over her head. Shock crossed her face as she felt his whole body against hers.

Luiz stood with one leg between hers, pressed hard against her mound. La'ryxs bit her lip as she ground against him, desperately trying to get more. Her breasts pushed against his chest, just below his chin. Her nipples blossomed in sensation as they grazed his shirt. Mostly she was aware of the intense heat that seemed to radiate from him. Her vision narrowed, his face only inches benath hers. She felt one of his hands wrap around her waist. She realised he was pinning both her arms above her head *with only one of his hands*.

""Goddess, what? He's strong!"" She thought. The idea of being held down by a *male*, of a man being strong like her was... alien.

Those thoughts were swept aside as, under hooded eyes, she saw his face in front of hers. His dark eyes stared back at her. Slowly, Luiz leaned in. Their mouths inched closer together. They smelt each other's breath, intoxicating and new. While La'ryxis longed to lunge forwards and kiss him, the excitement of approaching each other slowly held tremendous excitement.

Finally their lips brushed against each other. It was soft, light and sensual. She drank in his scent, her arms starting to strain, wanting desperately to embrace him. She clamped his leg between hers, hips writhing to better rub herself on his thigh.

Their mouths pressed more strongly against each other before she was electrified as she felt his tongue graze her lips. She eagerly opened her mouth wider and sought his tongue with hers. She struggled more, needing to envelop him, but he held her still. Finally, as their tongues intertwined he let her arms go. She wrapped them around his shoulders, clawing at his back. She felt his free hand also wrap around her waist and suddenly he had lifted her off the ground. Her legs clamped round him and she humped him desperately as she was carried to the bed.

Gently placing her on the sheets, Luiz broke the kiss. With a firm hand he pushed La'ryxis back so that she was resting on her elbows. Her breasts heaved with each breath, her eyes hooded and filled with lust. Her mouth hung partly open and her hair twisted around her shoulders.

As Luiz looked at her his eyes were drawn further down. Across her stomach, her abdominals tensed. Her legs splayed wide, the tendons of her inner thighs taught. His eyes were inexorably drawn to her centre. Her purple cunt was swollen, the outer lips enlarged. He noticed with interest that her inner labia were large, too. He sighed internally. He loved women with lips like that. They were so fun to finger, suck and to slide his dick between.

Giving her a final sultry look, Luiz lowered his head to her breasts, sucking her right nipple. La'ryxis let out a loud gasp, her head tilting back in ecstasy. His free hand found her other breast, fondling it. He explored around its edge, tracing his fingers around and over the nipple, interrupting this exploration by dragging his hand down her side and back.

Meanwhile his tongue would circle the first nipple. After several teasing laps he would finally lick it, then breath cold air on his own saliva. La'ryxis shook each time. She placed one hand on the back of his neck, gently stroking him as she looked down. It was heaven.

Luiz switched, repeating the process on her other breast. After giving it enough attention, he trailed back up her collarbone and neck, before nibbling her ear. This elicited a much stronger moan from her.

""You're beautiful,"" he whispered into her ear. A low growl came from the back of her throat. She tried to pull him back on top of her but he resisted, again. The growl developed an edge of frustration.

""You've done so well, putting up with my teasing. But I'm not finished with you yet."" His words set her mad with desire. She clawed at him but he resolutely pushed her back down. He trailed kisses back over her breasts then further down. Her breath hitched in anticipation - would she finally get release?

Luiz kissed her stomach, licking her sides then her hip creases. La'ryxis squirmed with pleasure. Slowly, ever so slowly, he kissed closer and closer. The anticipation was driving her crazy. She tried to slam her legs shut and trap his head between her thighs, but he held her back.

He started to circle her cunt with kisses and licks. He was suffused with her smell and rock hard. He nuzzled her, his nose and lips pushing dangerously close against her outer lips. Finally, with agonising delay, his tongue brushed over her labia. A shudder passed through La'ryxis and she wailed. His tongue lapped around her opening, before flicking directly over her clitoris. The stroke was light, but she let out a small scream as heat flashed through her.

Luiz looked up from where he was suckling her. He saw the expanse of her stomach, thighs either side, her breasts heaving. Her face was flushed blue, eyes heavy with lust as she stared down at him. He noticed with satisfaction a small string of drool at the corner of her mouth, so enthralled she hadn't noticed.

With a grin he began to lick her more energetically. He pressed his face hard against her, his chin coated with her fluids. His nose rubbed against the top of her slit while his tongue swept around her inner lips and up inside her. He trailed his fingers around her inner thighs, circling over her plump cheeks. Gently he gripped her buttocks, pulling them apart, stretching both her cunt and asshole.

La'ryxis’ breathing tightened, her vision going oily and black. Blood thundered in her ears as all other noises quietened but for the slurping sounds of Luiz. The old, familiar sensation of her orgasm came sweeping back. A moment of tension racked her body, then she crested the wave. Her body fell back as she screamed, legs shaking, hands tearing at the bedsheet.

Luiz slowed his work, paying close attention to La'ryxis' body language; this next part needed precision. It had been fun to learn Shil'vati were also capable of multiple orgasms. The poor ladies usually blacked out after their first and he'd heard their men didn't fare much better. As she lay dazed, he kissed her softly on her outer lips again, then gently licked the lowest part of her slit, just above her anus. His tongue flicked in and out, ever so gently.

As La'ryxis slowly came to she could feel her pleasure and excitement return, pushing away the fatigue that usually accompanied an orgasm. Groggily she raised herself back up to see Luiz still between her legs. His eyes danced with mirth as hers widened in shock.

""Goddess..."" She whispered. Luiz stood up, kissing her on the lips. His face was wet with her, she could smell and taste it on his tongue. She kissed him hard. Her hands gripped his face while their tongues wrapped around each other. She felt his palm on her lower belly slide down, his fingers gently sliding up and down her wet cunt. She moaned into his mouth again.

Luiz broke the kiss and stood up. She eyed him like her ancestors had when hunting. He stepped back so he was in full view then slowly undid the buttons on his shirt. As it came off she stared in admiration. He was incredibly muscled! This was the first time she had seen such a large human in person, man or woman. Certainly he was tall but his body was covered in rippling muscles. It was surreal.

Shil'vati were used to muscly women. Strong legs around curvaceous hips and a huge bust between large arms. But his body was just lean muscle. His waist was narrow, which made the muscles in his upper body seem even larger. His stomach muscles flexed and writhed, forming inviting lines that slithered underneath his pants, begging to be explored.

Luiz grinned wickedly at her. ""Come here,"" he said and she moved to stand up. ""No,"" he said and she hesitated. His voice had taken on a steely quality that left her uncertain. ""Crawl to me.""

Something about his change in tone set something off in the back of her head. She'd never been ordered around by a man before. It left her feeling uncertain and... aroused. She felt naked, not just physically but emotionally. But this new feeling was also filled with excitement. She lowered herself to the floor and crawled towards him on her hands and knees. It was almost humiliating - her, an Interior Agent for the Shil'vati Empire, crawling at the command of this sex-fiend human. Her pussy throbbed harder.

She finally reached him and kneeled at his feet. She sat with her legs tucked under her bottom, her head level with Luiz's stomach. As she looked up at him expectantly, Luiz admired all the curves before him. Her muscled, round ass spilled to the sides, her huge tits inches away from his cock.

""Undo my belt,"" he said.

With trembling hands La'ryxis reached for his pants. She undid the buckle, pulling it free.

""Good, now unzip the fly.""

She complied, slowly pulling his pants open. Her eyes were locked before her, fixated on the bulge that hid behind the thin fabric. She longed to just tear his clothes off and devour what lay beneath, to swallow him whole, but the power he held over was addictive. She glanced back up at him.

""Good girl,"" he said. She quivered at this compliment, one hand seeking her wet cunt as she slid her fingers against herself.

""Now, pull my pants down.""

She slid his trousers down revealing his black briefs underneath. Her breathing stopped as she saw the outline of his cock, thick and long. It was lying at an upright angle due to the tight fabric. Drool dripped from her mouth as time slowed, her pupils dilating. Nothing else seemed to matter in the whole galaxy.

""Now,"" Luiz continued. ""Pull my cock out.""

La'ryxis reached up, grabbing the elastic band of his briefs and yanked. His cock bounced free, smacking her in the face. She froze.

Sensations crashed through her. Heat emanated from his throbbing member (and oh, how it throbbed!), while his scent filled her nostrils. It was heady, musky, and her pussy gushed. Her hands gripped his hips and her tongue snaked out, licking the base of his shaft. She noted he had more hair in a tidy patch above his dark brown penis. Everything else was smooth and hairless.

She felt his hand coil through her hair. It hurt slightly as some strands were pulled. She glanced up at him. He seemed to loom over her, and she suddenly felt small.

""You've been so good tonight, La'ryxis. I want you to lick my dick from top to bottom.""

She nodded, smiling happily. She returned to licking, coating his dick with saliva. She could feel the ridges and veins. She especially enjoyed the rim of his head, her tongue swirling around the red-purple top, before running back down.

Luiz let out a satisfied groan. ""Uh, you're good."" She purred delightfully in response.

""Lick my balls.""

She nuzzled him, now licking his testicles. His cock rested over her face, and she breathed in deeply. Her tongue gently probed his balls, and she luxuriated in the experience. They felt full and heavy. The tought of what his balls held set her mind rife with the thoughts of him cumming in her - a bonus of interspecies sex was the impossibility of pregnancy. He could fill her up as much as they wanted.

She sucked more greedily, taking both balls into her large mouth. She gently tugged on them, running her tongue back and forth. Luiz eventually pulled her off him. She sat back, staring at him, saliva dripping long strands from her mouth.

Luiz gripped his penis, aiming it straight at her mouth. ""Open,"" he commanded.

She leaned forward, mouth agape, eager to taste him more. Slowly he put his cock in her mouth and her lips shut tight, forming a seal around it. She sucked, tongue sliding across the underside of his shaft. She began to move back and forth, partly out of her own desire and partly directed by the hand on the back of her head. She decided to surprise him and pushed forwards, swallowing him whole. Her nose pressed against his hard, lower abs, and her throat constricted around him. She heard Luiz grunt in pleasure and she felt pleased.

Seeing what she was capable of, Luiz started to slide her up and down his entire shaft. Slobbering noises began to pick up, more saliva dripping from her mouth. Her huge, purple breasts were coated in drool. Standing with feet wide, he gripped her head with both hands and began fucking her mouth more quickly.

""Tap my legs if you need to stop,"" he grunted. She moaned in acknowledgement, her hands gripping his hips in a vice like grip as she forcefully pulled him into and out of her mouth.

""Fuck,"" Luiz thought. He'd slept with many Shil, and they were all of them incredible at sucking dick.

Luiz felt a tightening in the base of his stomach. His cock throbbed and his balls ached.

""I'm gonna cum!"" He said.

La'ryxis picked up her pace, aiding him as he fucked her face. With a final grunt, Luiz released himself down her throat.

Cum erupted from his dick, surging forth. La'ryxis managed to swallow the first shot, but more quickly followed and she gagged. She pulled back slightly, his cock shooting more hot cum into her mouth. As his orgasm neared completion, Luiz pulled his dick out, and aimed the last few spurts over her face.

La'ryxis was a mess. Drool and cum covered her tits, some sliding down her belly and over her cunt, which itself was wet from her own excitement. Cum pooled in her mouth, spilling over her plump, purple lips and strands hung from her chin. Thick ropes had landed over her face; a pool of it on her forehead was now starting to dribble over her right eye.

Luiz let his still hard member rest on her face once more. Cum slowly oozed out of the tip, adding to the mess.

They both stared at each other.

Without saying anything, La'ryxis used her hands to wipe all the cum off her body. She sucked her fingers, licking them clean with small lip smacks of satisfaction. She grabbed his dick, now slightly limp, and sucked the end, extracting the last of his cum. She stroked it gently with one hand while the other wiped the cum on her face into her mouth.

""That was... incredible,"" she said.

Luiz looked down at her with an expression that made her heart melt. He kneeled in front of her and gently placed one hand around her waist, the other cupping her face.

""You are amazing,"" he said. He moved in to kiss her, and they shared a long, intimate kiss.

Slowly the kiss became more passionate. Their tongues started to fence as they pressed against each other harder. She still held his dick in one hand and she felt him grow hard again. She looked down with wonder as his dark shaft pointed up at her.

""Goddess above, it's just like they say!"" She exclaimed. These humans were everything and more that she'd heard about.

""We aren't finished, yet,"" Luiz replied.

I originally posted this in the SSB subreddit, then learned we can't crosspost to hfy. Will post here in future then crosspost back to SSB.

The SSB setting and gender flip is great. I love reading the stories, but always wanted more pancakes, so I've written my own. Mountains of pancakes drowning in maple syrup.

&amp;#x200B;

A large purple fist swings above him, narrowly missing him by inches. He dances around, keeping light on his feet as he slips from left to right, bobbing and weaving in the classic boxing stance.

He is in the basic orthodox position, his left arm slightly forward and partly extended. His right arm close to his body, his fists at chin level. His head is tucked as he continues to slip and duck from these wild flurry of blows.

He continues to dance back and forth, the fists narrowly missing his head. This game had gone on for a few minutes, the shil’vati woman was progressively getting more and more tired.

The lean male continued to duck and weave the punches, waiting for the woman to continue to get more and more winded. The purple alien lady suddenly staggered forward, leaving herself wide open.

He suddenly switches stances, turning his body from a more bladed position to a more squared stance. His fists low, down to around chest height. His left fist taking the rear, with the right fist taking the front.

He throws a left uppercut, digging right into the Purple woman’s kidneys. The woman groaned as she staggered forward, clutching her side in agony. He grunted, suddenly throwing up his rear leg, throwing a powerful snapping question mark kick right into the woman’s chin.

The woman fell flat on her face, being knocked out. He huffs, rolling his neck and cracking his knuckles, it is then he finally refocuses, the outside world rushing back to meet him.

He looks around, hearing the sounds of cheering and yelling, standing inside a small ring made out of metal fencing and plastic barrels. He is surrounded by a crowd of yelling humans, cheering him on.

He sighs, looking down at his fists and seeing his wrapped up hands, the bandages were a little worn but not unkempt. He looks around him, noticing a group of purple women, the shil’vati groaning and looking disappointed.

He gives them a faint smile to cheer them up, one of them making eye contact with him as she smiles back weakly. He grunts, walking to where a man in a very very cheaply made grey blazer and white shirt was waiting.

He sighs, rubbing the back of his head as he goes to dap up the man in the grey blazer. Said person was Ernesto, the man in charge of the unofficial street tournament, Man vs Alien!

It was simple, it was a bare knuckle mixed martial arts match between the alien women and human men. Simple, whoever manages to get the other person to tap out or end the fight via KO wins a prize.

The prize for the aliens, or in this case, shil’vati? Men, they get to sleep with a fighter and they get to choose who.

The prize for the men? Money, a cash prize, the sum can vary depending on how many fights they’ve won and how long the fight has lasted.

Both parties must pay an entrance fee of 100 credits, whoever wins, gets to leave with their prize. Whoever loses, gets nothing. Of course, this isn’t the only way to make money, because there is a viewing fee for anyone in attendance who would like to watch the fight.

No cellphone recording unless authorized makes sure people who hear about it, have to come and watch to see the Purp vs Man smackdown! With each entrant having to pay 20 credits, Ernesto was making a fair sum of money.

Since it was Man who won against Shil’vati, Xu Mao Gong or Alistair will be taking home a cash prize today.

Alistair was a Chinese-American male standing at 6’2 and weighing in at 170 pounds, with a reach of 75 inches. He is relatively young, being only 19 years of age. Ernesto on the other hand, was around 24, being about 5’9.

Ernesto pats him on the back, handing him an envelope of his winnings which he had prepared beforehand.“I already counted it, don’t worry, it’s 1,000 credits. Go take care of your padre yeah?”

“Thanks.”

Alistair clambers out of the makeshift ring. Said ring was located inside an abandoned warehouse on the fisherman’s wharf in San francisco. He looks around, snatching his tank top off the ground.

He was covered in sweat, deciding not to put his shirt on. He flexes slightly, his pecs and muscles popping as the sweat covered torso glints under the light of the Warehouse.

This however, catches the eyes of the Shil’vati, earning him an ass tap on the way out and catcalling as he leaves the building.

He quietly shuts the door behind him, looking up at the night sky. It was around 11 pm, he had to get home soon. Shouting and the sounds of cheering could be heard mutely from inside, luckily, it was late enough that the noise really didn’t garner any attention. Plus, the warehouse had thick walls which helped insulate the noise from travelling far out.

He walks past, huffing slightly as his sweat slowly cools in the spring weather. He nods to the bouncer or security guard, whatever his title was, standing outside the warehouse.

A bald white male, wearing nothing but a black t-shirt, cargo pants and boots. He doesn’t say anything except nodding back.

He walks off, approaching his car which was parked outside. People weren’t allowed to park their cars in front of the warehouse, in case it got too much police attention. But he was one of the fighters and he had connections with the boss.

Plus, he was quite the piece of eye candy, with many purps coming just to watch him fight and strike up a conversation with him. However, he wasn’t in the mood and didn’t feel like doing some purple bitch.

He sighs, unlocking his car, a relatively old Toyota corolla. It had already been 6 years since the occupation. He sighs once more, driving off in the direction of Chinatown.

Chapter 13: Movie Night

 

As Zachary held the DVD up, the faces of the humans in the room split into a mix of malicious glee and concerned shock. They knew that movie. It was a hard watch, even for the veterans that made up the majority of their number. Several of them suspected that Zachary was doing this out of pure spite, though it was hard to blame him. The Shil'vati, and the Marines in particular, saw human history as little more than fetish material for their masturbatory fantasies. To say they had a rose tinted view of humanity's military history was putting it mildly. The prospect of shattering the collective delusion, however... that was enough to keep any objections unspoken.

‘I wonder how they’d feel about Schindler’s List or Passchendaele?’ Zachary thought to himself as the movie began to play. 

In total, about 28 Shil’vati, three Helkam, two Rakiri, and ten humans, sat in the rec room to watch the movie, while various others played the games available. For about the first two or so minutes, all was calm. The girls in the room made comments about how cute the guys looked, how they felt bad about them when they vomited, or how adorable they looked with a serious expression on their faces.

Then all hell broke loose.

The ramps lowered, and the men residing in the first landing craft were cut down with a barrage of machine gun fire, sparing no man, as they desperately tried exiting their landing craft. Machine guns barked as the operators poured death down upon the Americans on Omaha Beach. Men jumped into the water to avoid the hailstorm of bullets, only to find the water around, turning red with the blood of their fellow soldiers. Men desperately trying to shed off their equipment were either hit from incoming rounds or sank to the bottom as they drowned. Around the room, the various aliens looked on in wide eyed horror at the events unfolding.

“It's only just beginning!” Zachary yelled over the screen, as he refused to take his eyes off of the group, relishing their every reaction.

They finally reached the beach, hundreds of men, dead and alive, covered the sands. Artillery and machine gun fire intensified as soldiers desperately took any cover they could find. As an exploding shell sent a man flying with his leg blown off, one of the Shils in the room vomited right at her feet, while another began sobbing to herself. Others began crying at the sight of a soldier crying, while hiding from machine gun fire behind a hedgehog. When a soldier carrying a flame thrower was hit, and the tank on his back ignited, taking the two nearby men with him, the first Shil left the room.

By the time the blood soaked Captain had laid eyes on the armless soldier wandering the beach, picking up his severed limb, and running forward, even more of the girls had burst into sobs, and were losing the contents of their stomachs. Even Kadra, who was present for the movie, as well as a male Helkam, looked downright disturbed at the events unfolding before them.

The sight of soldiers running out of their landing craft while burning alive, with their brothers in arms desperately trying to help them, was something that rattled every last cadre member. Another two vomited, and even the Rakiri were visibly disturbed by the scenes playing out.

“This can’t be real!” One of the Shil’vati cried in disbelief. The eyes of the girl in question were puffy and she was hyperventilating as the movie continued to play.

“It's real, and it happened. This event happening is the only reason my ass is even here to talk to you. When the movie is over, I’ll show you real photos of the battle, if you want.” A few of the aliens in the room just stared at him with mouths agape, horrified expressions on their faces.

The movie continued on, the Captain rallying his men to advance forward on the beach, even as the defenders rained death with unending fury upon the advancing soldiers. The next scene however, would be the breaking point for most in the room. A fallen soldier, holding in his intestines, while crying out for his mother, proved too much for many of the cadre members. Three more vomited, while at least triple that number immediately got up, and raced out of the room.

Little over half of the original number in the rec room remained, with more seeming closer to the breaking point. The fighting continued, the Captain dragging an injured soldier forward, even as more men fell all around them. An exploding shell knocked the Captain down, forcing him to let go of the man he was dragging to safety. He got up, grabbing him again, only to realize he was dragging half a corpse forward. Upon seeing this, even one of the Rakiri in the room lost the contents of her stomach, while the other got up and left in a hurry. Even the other two male aliens got up and practically sprinted from the room at that point, as well as more of the Shil’vati women.

When the soldiers reached just below the bunkers that spat death, only 13 Shil’vati, Trissila among them, one Helkam, and one Rakiri remained watching the movie. The room began reeking of vomit left from the girls who couldn’t handle it. The next few scenes however, ended up clearing out the room of nearly all the remaining alien occupants.

A radio operator who had his face blown open from a stray round. A group of medics desperately trying to stop the bleeding of a wounded soldier, only for a bullet to hit the soldier's head, to which one of the medics screams to the heavens, pleading for a chance. A soldier screaming in agony as a medic clamped a bleeding artery. Another whose helmet deflected a bullet, and took it off to check its integrity, only for another round to blow his brains out.

By the end of the beach attack, with burning defenders jumping from bunkers, and those attempting to surrender being shot, seven Shil’vati and the Rakiri remained. However, as Zachary turned to look in the doorway, something a few of the other humans did, they saw three new faces. The Duty Drill Instructors assigned over them were watching. One could only guess at how long they had been there, but it was clear they saw plenty. Two of them stared agape at the screen, while the other, rubbing her scarred hand and biting her lip, looked far more reserved.

“Ah, shit!” Was all that escaped Zachary’s mouth.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“So this all started because the girls wanted to watch a war movie, hoping to see a bunch of topless human men?” Senior Drill Instructor Prisma asked.

“It seems so,” Drill Instructor Rayna said as she leaned against a nearby wall. “I took the other two DI’s on duty to figure out what the commotion was, and they were all watching that movie. By the time they noticed us standing in the doorway, most of them had either left the room crying or had evacuated their stomachs in the rec room.”

“I know, and I ordered Ka’Varik to clean it up, much to the woman’s anger, but she doesn’t have the tits to refuse.”

“Why would they even show them a movie like that? There’s no way that’s real!” Drill Instructor Larena exclaimed.

“If I had to wager, they likely did it out of spite.” Prisma replied.

“And as for it being real, take it from someone who’s fought against them, that battle was very much real. I’ve seen firsthand how fanatical they can be against overwhelming odds.” Rayna said, glancing down at the wound on her hand.

“Yeah, because I was wondering why I had two of my recruits come back to the sleeping area, bawling their eyes out.” The SDI of cadre 4, Varalin said. “But why would they show that movie out of spite?”

“From what I’ve gathered, and the other Senior Drill Instructors have been told, they constantly pester the humans for sex.” She said, shaking her head in disbelief. “I really don’t understand it either. They don’t complain about the training or the food, they complain about being asked for sex.”

“Doesn’t really surprise me in the slightest.” Rayna said. “As someone who spent time in a red zone filled with former military personnel who weren’t happy with us, giving the girls the cold shoulder isn’t surprising. Besides, in their militaries, sex in basic was forbidden.”

“Even discounting the ones we know, or suspect are former military, there’s still a handful that are too young to have been so when we first arrived on Earth!” Drill Instructor Orlana said. SDI Prisma just sighed once again at the question.

“Me and the Seniors for cadres one through five, told the humans this very same thing. They responded that they had no interest or attraction to any of their cadre members.”

“All but one, anyway.” Said SDI Salena, of Cadre 5. “The youngest human in the Cadre slept with a Rakiri all things! Out of all the girls present, he decides to go be with a furball!”

“Some humans are into that kind of thing, I’m told.” Varalin said. “Although when i told my humans about our regulations on sex, the young one just said he preferred older women, and I swear, the look on his face made it seem like he was referring to me!” Some of the DI’s just laughed.

“Don’t go thinking with your clam, they're still recruits after all!” Prisma chuckled. 

“For now, anyway. Won’t stay that way forever.” Varalin replied. ‘And maybe I’ll see if that human really was referring to me after all!’ She thought to herself.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If Zachary was being completely honest with himself, he was absolutely enjoying this training exercise. After being issued their standard infantry armor, they were chased off into the woods by six armed DI’s, who were tasked with hunting them down. All he and his fellow recruits needed to do was reach the other side. He looked back behind the treeline, waiting for any movement to occur, so he could book it from the tree he was hiding against.

“This is certainly an experience, wouldn’t you say?” Came the voice of Elias Mayer, the resident German, and former GSG9 officer, before the Shil’vati made his job specialty worthless, and he was kicked to the curb.

“Yeah, I’d certainly say so. Can’t say my basic training involved getting chased by seven foot Drill Instructors toting blaster pistols. Seems a bit easy though, given that we’ve already outrun all of them.”

“If there’s one thing I’ve learned over the years, it is that the Shil aren’t built for stamina like we are. On the battlefield or in the bedroom, they can’t keep up.”

“In the bedroom?” Mayer asked quizzically. If he didn’t have the helmet on, Zachary would see he raised an eyebrow at the comment, but he could still hear the curiousness in the German’s voice.

“Long story short, I got involved with a boot LT that saved my ass way back in the day, and we grew a bit fond of each other. When we get through this, I’ll explain better.”

“No need to explain yourself, although I won’t lie that you don’t seem like the man to-” Mayer’s voice cut off as the motion sensors in their helmets picked up movement coming, rather fast too. They squeezed closer to the trees they were hiding behind, and got ready for whatever was coming. They peered out from the trees, and low and behold, the cadre’s loveable space twink, Kadra, was booking it full speed their way. That is, until he didn’t watch his step, tripped over a log, fell, and rolled a good dozen or so feet forward.

“Fuck!” Kadra screamed. The way he rolled on his foot meant that him directly getting up and trying to run was a nonstarter. But he didn’t have a few minutes to sit around and wait for the pain to die down enough for him to run. They both looked over at each other.

“No man left behind. How do you want to do this?” Zachary said as they both noticed another red blip on the edge of the minimap.

“We’ll need a way to distract the DI coming our way? Any ideas on that front?” They both looked around, and it didn’t take long for them to figure out what they could do. Mud and giant sticks were aplenty in the forested area. As they came up with the plan, they noticed that Kadra had dragged himself to a nearby tree, and was trying to hide. They also noticed a figure in the black slinking her way towards said tree.

The DI didn’t know they were there, and that’s just what they needed. Creeping through the trees, they managed to stay in the DI’s blind spot, just long enough for them to close the gap enough. By the time the DI finally noticed them, it was too late, using a mixture of mud, dirt, leaves, and twigs, they both made handheld projectiles that they tossed directly into the DI’s face, which obscured her helmet, and her vision.

“What the fuck?” She hissed as she tried wiping away the mud, only for Mayer to rush forward with a comically gigantic branch, and swung directly into her pistol hand, which sent the weapon flying, and the DI recoiling from the impact on her fingers. Another mudball thrown into her face distracted her just long enough for them to run over to Kadra, prop him up, and get him ready to move.

“We gotta move now!” Zachary shouted as he tossed one last mudball at the offending DI, who took her helmet off, and restored her vision. They both got a quick enough glance at each other before the ball hit the DI, Ka’Varik, square in the face. With her immobilized, Zachary threw Kadra over his shoulder in a buddy carry, and he and Mayer began hauling ass away from the DI, before more could arrive.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Upon reaching the end of the clearing, aside from Trissila and of course Kadra, nearly every human had beaten their Shil’vati counterparts to the finish line. Setting Kadra down, and looking back behind him, he noticed more began trickling in behind, including a Rakiri, and her new human boyfriend. If this was BWT at Parris island, he’d say they they probably finished fucking in the woods. But they were just truly exhausted at the event they had just completed.

The Gurkha, Fisher, White, and the Brit were the first to have made it through, followed by most of the other humans. The ones that came in last were the four obvious civilians, and the Finnish woman. However that last was relative, as she tied with the Maori kid, only a few seconds behind Novikov. In the end, none of the humans got shot, and most of cadres 1-5 made it through in the end.

This meant that those who made it through to the end, would get to apply for off base leave. For the vets here, the prospect of being able to hit up a bar, after dealing with the ridiculousness of the past month and half, was a godsend to them. That and it would at least give them some privacy by means of booking a hotel, away from horny Shil’vati. Although after the fight, and the movie night, many had become more standoffish to most of the humans. Not that it bothered them, most of them enjoyed not being bugged by them nonstop. Most were disappointed that Zachary and his fellow humans wouldn’t fuck them, and even more bothered that the only human who did fuck, did so with a Rakiri. ‘Good old fashioned racism.’ Zachary thought as he heard the various Shils use derogatory terms about the space werewolf.

Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the six DI’s exit the woods, with the various failure recruits who got shot. Among them was Ka’Varik, who sought him out, and just glared at him. He noticed this and returned her glare. The mutual feeling of hatred and scorn ran strong in them as each eye fucked the other. It came to a head as she stalked forward, stopping but a half dozen feet in front of him, before she spoke.

“I’m at half pay until the next cycle because of you, human!” She said bitterly. “I had to clean the rec room after that movie you showed, and now you have the nerve to do what you just did.”

“Resisting isn’t forbidden, Drill Instructor.” He said, his glare not fading as he stared into her eyes, not giving up any ground. Both the DI’s and recruits noticed this confrontation, and before it could get worse, the Senior intervened.

“Drill Instructor Ka’Varik, get over here now!” She barked. He noticed the young DI flinch at the order.

“I hate you, human!” She said before walking away.",/r/HFY/comments/oeozip/semper_shilvati_an_ssbverse_story_chapter_13/,77
68,oev2vx,HFY,Tue Jul  6 16:36:47 2021,"[SSBverse] Streetfighter Chapter 1, Question Mark?","A large purple fist swings above him, narrowly missing him by inches. He dances around, keeping light on his feet as he slips from left to right, bobbing and weaving in the classic boxing stance.

He is in the basic orthodox position, his left arm slightly forward and partly extended. His right arm close to his body, his fists at chin level. His head is tucked as he continues to slip and duck from these wild flurry of blows.

He continues to dance back and forth, the fists narrowly missing his head. This game had gone on for a few minutes, the shil’vati woman was progressively getting more and more tired.

The lean male continued to duck and weave the punches, waiting for the woman to continue to get more and more winded. The purple alien lady suddenly staggered forward, leaving herself wide open.

He suddenly switches stances, turning his body from a more bladed position to a more squared stance. His fists low, down to around chest height. His left fist taking the rear, with the right fist taking the front.

He throws a left uppercut, digging right into the Purple woman’s kidneys. The woman groaned as she staggered forward, clutching her side in agony. He grunted, suddenly throwing up his rear leg, throwing a powerful snapping question mark kick right into the woman’s chin.

The woman fell flat on her face, being knocked out. He huffs, rolling his neck and cracking his knuckles, it is then he finally refocuses, the outside world rushing back to meet him.

He looks around, hearing the sounds of cheering and yelling, standing inside a small ring made out of metal fencing and plastic barrels. He is surrounded by a crowd of yelling humans, cheering him on.

He sighs, looking down at his fists and seeing his wrapped up hands, the bandages were a little worn but not unkempt. He looks around him, noticing a group of purple women, the shil’vati groaning and looking disappointed.

He gives them a faint smile to cheer them up, one of them making eye contact with him as she smiles back weakly. He grunts, walking to where a man in a very very cheaply made grey blazer and white shirt was waiting.

He sighs, rubbing the back of his head as he goes to dap up the man in the grey blazer. Said person was Ernesto, the man in charge of the unofficial street tournament, Man vs Alien!

It was simple, it was a bare knuckle mixed martial arts match between the alien women and human men. Simple, whoever manages to get the other person to tap out or end the fight via KO wins a prize.

The prize for the aliens, or in this case, shil’vati? Men, they get to sleep with a fighter and they get to choose who.

The prize for the men? Money, a cash prize, the sum can vary depending on how many fights they’ve won and how long the fight has lasted.

Both parties must pay an entrance fee of 100 credits, whoever wins, gets to leave with their prize. Whoever loses, gets nothing. Of course, this isn’t the only way to make money, because there is a viewing fee for anyone in attendance who would like to watch the fight.

No cellphone recording unless authorized makes sure people who hear about it, have to come and watch to see the Purp vs Man smackdown! With each entrant having to pay 20 credits, Ernesto was making a fair sum of money.

Since it was Man who won against Shil’vati, Xu Mao Gong or Alistair will be taking home a cash prize today.

Alistair was a Chinese-American male standing at 6’4 and weighing in at 180 pounds, with a reach of 82.5 inches. He is relatively young, being only 19 years of age. Ernesto on the other hand, was around 24, being about 5’9.

Ernesto pats him on the back, handing him an envelope of his winnings which he had prepared beforehand.“I already counted it, don’t worry, it’s 1,000 credits. Go take care of your padre yeah?”

“Thanks.”

Alistair clambers out of the makeshift ring. Said ring was located inside an abandoned warehouse on the fisherman’s wharf in San francisco. He looks around, snatching his tank top off the ground.

He was covered in sweat, deciding not to put his shirt on. He flexes slightly, his pecs and muscles popping as the sweat covered torso glints under the light of the Warehouse.

This however, catches the eyes of the Shil’vati, earning him an ass tap on the way out and catcalling as he leaves the building.

He quietly shuts the door behind him, looking up at the night sky. It was around 11 pm, he had to get home soon. Shouting and the sounds of cheering could be heard mutely from inside, luckily, it was late enough that the noise really didn’t garner any attention. Plus, the warehouse had thick walls which helped insulate the noise from travelling far out.

He walks past, huffing slightly as his sweat slowly cools in the spring weather. He nods to the bouncer or security guard, whatever his title was, standing outside the warehouse.

A bald white male, wearing nothing but a black t-shirt, cargo pants and boots. He doesn’t say anything except nodding back.

He walks off, approaching his car which was parked outside. People weren’t allowed to park their cars in front of the warehouse, in case it got too much police attention. But he was one of the fighters and he had connections with the boss.

Plus, he was quite the piece of eye candy, with many purps coming just to watch him fight and strike up a conversation with him. However, he wasn’t in the mood and didn’t feel like doing some purple bitch.

He sighs, unlocking his car, a relatively old Toyota corolla. It had already been 6 years since the occupation. He sighs once more, driving off in the direction of Chinatown.

84,oftlra,HFY,Thu Jul  8 01:22:53 2021,"[SSBverse] Streetfighter Chapter 2, Bonding?","Alistair Xu stopped his car in front of the small Chinese restaurant. He looks around the street. There were a few people milling around but not as much as before the Occupation.

Having purple aliens running around trying to fuck men and run the whole show at night tends to dampen people going out. Especially little children, the amount of boys in general showing up at dark had dropped drastically. A lot of concerned parents are afraid of them being harassed or snatched up.

He sighs, stepping out of his car and locking it up. He approaches the store shutter, leaning down to unlock it, before pulling it up with a loud rattling noise. He sighs, letting it slam behind him, locking it from the inside.

He pushes open the glass door, walking through the dark and empty floor of a Chinese restaurant. Tables and seats immaculate, the kitchen area spotless, well, not that he could tell anyway, since it was pitch black.

He walks up a flight of stairs, reaching a wooden door at the top. He rolls his shoulders once, before picking another key on his ring of keys, unlocking the door and stepping inside quietly. He closes the door behind him before locking it up, keeping quiet.

He steps through the dark apartment, removing his shoes by placing them inside a shoe cabinet directly to the right of the entrance. He removes the envelope of credits, walking right to the living room table, placing it down.

The apartment he was living in was relatively large for the area, with around 2,000 square feet of space. It had a small kitchen area, open and directly connected to the dining room. Next to the dining room and kitchen area was a room, closed off by a wooden door and walls. To the right of the room was a bathroom, closed off by a wooden door. It had a basic shower and toilet, relatively bare bones when it came to it.

Further down the hallway, there is the living room to the right , separated off by a wall but is again open, with the balcony directly linked to it. A sofa and a few chairs, with a small coffee table in between the furniture. With a decently sized TV propped up on a cabinet.

To the left, another hallway with three rooms, a gym room, one for Alistair and another for his brother. He heads off into the room on the left, closing the door silently behind him.

His room is pretty bare bones, a wooden computer desk to the right of the doorway with a laptop. Two cupboards with cabinets at the bottom of them on the left side at the foot of the bed. The bed was quite large, a queen size mattress and bed frame.

Under the bed frame was another set of cabinets and a small cupboard. His room was decorated with two posters, one of Bruce Lee and another of Xu Xiao Dong. He sighs, removing his socks, automatic knife, wallet and keychain, before throwing them on top of his desk drawer

He takes off his shirt and pants, tossing them on the ground before flopping on the bed, taking out his phone and setting the alarm for 7 am. He lays back, wrapping himself under the blankets before going to sleep.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*Ring...Ring...Ring*

Alistair’s eyes shoot open, reaching over to his left to unlock his phone. He sighs, turning off to alarm as he sits up on his bed. He groans, walking in his underwear to the shower, taking his phone with him.

He yanks open the door and closes it quietly, locking it behind him. Placing down his phone next to the sink. He goes to take a shower, removing his clothing and quickly washing up.

10 minutes later, Alistair steps out, drying himself off and putting on his underwear. He snatches his phone before walking back to his room, quickly changing into something more comfortable. He puts on a grey hoodie, black sweatpants, new socks and his hand wraps.

He sighs, grabbing his keychain, automatic knife and wallet on his desk, shoving them inside his pockets. He sighs, walking to the front door, putting on his black sneakers. He opens the door and locks it behind him quietly.

He moves down the flight of stairs, opening and closing the shutter before locking it. He heads off on his morning run, going to get some HIIT cardio work.

Roughly 30 minutes later, he jogs back to the front of the restaurant, huffing a little before unlocking the shutter door and repeating the same process, closing and locking it behind him. Heading into the restaurant and back up the stairs to his flat.

He heads on in, locking the door behind him before removing his shoes. He sighs, walking to the kitchen area, going to prepare breakfast.

He sniffs, taking out a couple eggs, sausages and bacon, starting to fry them up in separate pans with Coconut oil. As this is going on, he takes out a blender from the top cabinet, some whipped cream, bananas and whole milk.

While he starts serving breakfast on two plates, he blends himself a bulking smoothie, blending the whipped cream, bananas and whole milk to make a smoothie. He sniffs, taking out the utensils from the drawer before setting them on the table.

Afterwards, he takes up his bulking smoothie, pouring it into a large glass mug for him to drink from. He sighs, reaching into one of the bottom cabinets and takes out a bag of whey powder. He scoops up one serving before mixing everything together with a spoon.

He sniffs, taking a sip from the smoothie as he leans on the edge of the cabinet, as people start to wake up.

His father walks out the door, grunting as he is still in his pajamas, a very simple clear light blue design for the elderly. He looked to be in his mid 40s, with a large broad skull and mandible. He looked similar to the old railway workers from the 1800s. He was relatively short too, standing at around 5’8 as he sat down to go eat.

“Hey dad.”

“Hey, are you still working on your gig?”

He nods, gesturing with a thumb to the envelope, “1,000 credits there, I’ve still got more work tomorrow so I’ll come back with more.”

His father nods, before going in to eat.

“Wake up your brother before you go and brush your teeth.”

Alistair nods, walking over to his brother's room and slamming his fist on the door.

“FUCK!”, came to loud cry from inside his room

“Wake up, it’s breakfast. You’ve got school in 20 minutes, get dressed.”

“Alright! You don’t need to fucking slam the door!”

Alistair sighs, walking back to sit at the table, going to finish off his smoothie.

5 minutes pass, as Alistair’s younger brother, Alan walks out to go eat his breakfast. He sits down, wearing a plain red t-shirt and light grey jogger pants. He plops down, standing at around 5’9. He was relatively young, being 14, with a relatively broad face and square chin.

Alistair had already finished his breakfast and his father, Peter, was already going to get dressed and prepare to send Alan to school.

Alan sighs, eating his breakfast quickly as Alistair leans back.

“Hey Alan, wrestling tryouts are some time this month right?”

“We’ve got another week before official team practice.”

“Good luck, if you need any help or advice just ask me alright.”

“Whatever, I’ll be fine.”

Alistair shrugs, “Sure. I'll head off to go train.”

“Already? Don’t you have another hour before you need to go?”“

No, I’m meeting up with a few people to train with.” Alistair gets up, walking towards the door, hearing his father shout from inside the bathroom

“USE THE SIDE DOOR THIS TIME!”

“GOT IT!” Alistair yells back, waving to his brother once before shutting the door.

He heads down the flight of stairs, before turning to the left instead of heading directly to the shuttered off entrance, going to the side door. He unlocks it, walking out before locking it behind him.

He sighs, walking to the alleyway and takes out a phone, firing off a quick text into the group chat he’s in

*Alright I’m coming to saint marys square, give me 10 minutes.*

A few seconds later, another text from the group chat fires off

*Hurry the fuck up, we’re all sitting here waiting for you.*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

After 10 minutes, Alistair finally arrives at Saint Mary square, rolling his shoulder, he looks at two people standing next to a bench. He rushes over, waving once to catch their attention as he walks up.

“Wassup Jacob, wassup Dontae.”

He sniffs, fist bumping both of them in turn as they nod back at him. Alistair sighs, glancing around and then back to his friends. Jacob was a caucasian male, blonde hair, blue eyes, standing at 5’11 and 180 pounds, with a wingspan of 72 inches. He was roughly around the same age as Alistair, being 18 years old. Dontae was african american, 6’0 and 170 pounds, with a reach of 76 inches. He was the same age as Alistair, being 19.

“You guys did road work already, yeah?”

They both nod, as Alistair sighs, “Alright then, we’re heading to the gym then right?”

“Yeah.” Dontae speaks up, “Come on then, let’s go.”

“Whose car are we taking this time?”

“Mine.” Jacob grunts, walking ahead of the two to go unlock his car, “Well come on!”

Alistair and Dontae pick up the pace, heading inside the car as Jacob starts it up. All three of them head off to go do their training for the day.

With roughly 15 minutes of driving, Jacob parks in front of the MMA gym they were planning to head on in. He sighs, leaning back into his seat.

“We’ve got 10 more minutes left, let’s just sit here and chill for a while.”Dontae shrugs, having sat shotgun, he takes out his phone and starts surfing the datanet.

“Yo guys check this out.” Dontae reaches back and taps Alistair on the head as he’s staring into space

“Huh?”

“Come look at this video, it’s fucking blowing up on the datanet.”

Both Alistair and Jacob lean forward, the video was a caucasian male landing a mean right hook and managing to knock out a shil’vati cold, laying her ass on the ground.

“Nice.” Alistair grins, he didn’t hate or love the shil’vati. He just appreciated a good punch like any other practitioner of a striking based combat sport.

Jacob on the hand was much more malicious and sadistic when it came to his appreciation of the violence, “Serves that fucking purp bitch right.”

He lets out a chuckle before leaning back with a smile on his face. His mood had visibly improved, leaning back on the seat.

“So that’s why you chose to fight in Man vs Alien then?”“Of course I fucking hate purps, I’m getting paid to beat the shit out of them. Speaking of which, I’m going to be fighting tonight.”

“What about you Dontae?” Alistair glances at Dontae

He shrugs, “I don’t really care man, I’m just fighting them cause I’m good at it and it’s a lot safer and hassle free than joining up to be a pro fighter or committing crimes. What about you Alistair?”

“Helping support the family, plus, I’m good at fighting.”

Dontae nods once, before looking at the time on his phone.

“Whatever, let’s just head in now. We need to get some training in, you especially Jacob.”

Jacob grunts, rummaging around in his car's dashboard, wanting to find the necessary items he had to bring with him. He pauses for a second before looking back at his two friends,

“Hey guys, can you come over to watch the fight tonight? It’s my first match so, I’d like some support.”

Alistair shrugs and says passive aggressively, “Sure. Even though you weren’t at the fight last night.”

“Alright, alright, my bad! I’ll come to the next one, just tell me when.”

Dontae looks over, “Sure I’ll come. We’ll watch your fight tonight, but hurry the fuck up and get out of the car. Keep it light, don’t work yourself too hard, you don’t want to pull a muscle during practice. You’ll be fucked against those purple bitches.”

Jacob waves his hand dismissively, “Yeah yeah, whatever. I know, tire them out, we’ve got better endurance and reaction time. Keep good footwork and cardio, dance around them, then take them out. I got it.”

Alistair grunts, opening the car door, as he steps out. He glances over at the two of his compatriots as they headed towards the Gym.

The most important thought on Alistair’s mind regarding today's session was,

*I’m going to spar with the biggest guy and lay his ass on the fucking ground.*

Chapter 14: Night in Town

&amp;#x200B;

 Off base liberty. Off base liberty in basic training. Off base liberty in basic for *enlisted*! There were alot of weird military regulations the Shil’vati followed, but this was by far the most jarring. Having their omnipads, access to a recreation room, and being allowed to have sex, wouldn’t have ever been dreamed of in Marine basic. Hell, even the army only allowed phones on the weekends, and they were the army! But going into town on the weekends, being allowed to drink, and stay at hotels? That was what you expected of Officer Candidates School, not basic training for enlisted members.

Not that any of the human cadre members were complaining. Most of the recruits of cadres 1-10, the Lead Series of the entire training company, had successfully passed the training exercise, and had two days of leave to go out in town. The gagglefuck of Shil’vati, Helkam, and Rakiri seemed overjoyed at the prospect, while the humans, most of them anyway, were mostly content to hit up a bar. One of the humans, an American kid named Victor, was excited to spend some time alone with his new Rakiri girlfriend.

Excited, that is, until said Rakiri tried, with help from her friends, to pressure him into sleeping with more than just her. In fact, a great many of the girls present thought they’d be getting lucky tonight, and tried convincing the men of the cadres to join them. Even Kadra, and some Helkam male by the name of Akari, were unnerved at the constant barrage of requests to join them for the night. Factoring in the more handsy girls of the various cadres, making their nervousness even more obvious, Zachary stepped in, and ushered them to the group of humans. Well, he did more than step in, he slung an arm around each of their waists, and pulled them away, something that made them both flush.

“Aww, come on!” One of the girls, Halani, cried in disappointment. “We’re just trying to have some fun on our night out!”

“They don’t want to have fun with you,” Zachary retorted. “But I’m guessing consent doesn’t matter to you oversized alien bitches, does it?” He replied sharply. The implication of what he said was not lost on them, nor did he miss how most of their shoulders slumped at his comment.

“We’re not rapists,"" Another of them said, barely audible.

“Could have fooled me. Now take the fucking hint, and leave us the fuck alone. We’re not interested in sleeping with any of you. Or do we need to use this, to drive the point home?” Zachary warned, taking the gray aerosol bottle out of his pocket, an action other men in the group mirrored. Kadra and Akari had recommended they visit a specific shop before going to the hotel, and buy it. It was called Grinshaw Repellent, and it was effectively pepper spray. Or “Bitch Be Gone Spray”, like how most of the men referred to it.

Many of the women visibly recoiled at the sight of the spray, and given the behavior and attitudes they'd witnessed of the human men in the last few weeks, they had no doubts that they’d use them.

“You don’t trust us, do you?” One of the Helkam girls rubbed her arm nervously. Zachary just shook his head, an expression that Fisher, White, and a few others echoed.

“Trust you not to get us drunk in a bar and drag us to your room? Trust you not to cross boundaries we’ve explicitly laid out repeatedly? Trust you to take no for an answer? No, we fucking don’t.”

“This is the fucking issue here,” One of the girls snapped, exasperated, throwing her arms up in the air. “You refuse to trust us, despite all we’ve been through in basic, and we’re supposed to be your sisters in arms! If you won’t trust us, even after all this time, and doing nothing to earn this scorn from you, why should we trust you in turn?”

“Ok, first off, that part about you doing nothing to earn our distrust, isn’t fucking true. Our first few weeks here were filled with nothing but catcalls, perverted gazes, sexually provocative comments, and constant badgering for sex. For fuck's sake, this bitch right here.” he pointed to the girl who had flashed him back in the early days of training. The glare she got from Zachary alone was enough to make her want to shrink down and not be noticed. “After flashing me when I specifically said I wasn’t interested, her first instinct was to go cry like a petulant fucking child, because I wouldn’t give it up to her horny, desperate ass!”

“Or constantly forming a wall around us when we walk,” White broke in. “Not sure if you could tell, but it's extremely annoying to us.”

“But it's something you're supposed to do when you're out with a guy! We’re supposed to keep you safe!”

“Do you think we need your protection?” Novikov spat.

“Yeah, we outrun you all, you’ve yet to take any of us down in a fight, nearly all of us have taken top spot on the firing range, and more importantly than that.” Fisher paused and focused his glare on the group as a whole. “*We’ve seen combat! You. Have. Not.”* 

“With that said, we’re not sharing rooms with any of you,” Brian Matherson, former FBI Sniper, said. Ignoring the looks of horror and sadness on their faces, the various humans went up to the concierge, and booked their rooms. The two females took their own rooms, obviously, while the rest split up into groups of three per room, to ensure safety, with Zachary taking Akari and Kadra with him. As they were getting ready to leave, they heard the last bit of arguing between Victor and his girlfriend.

“I’m not sleeping with her!” Victor snapped indignantly.

“But Sakari is my packmate, we’ve always shared our males with each other!” The Rakiri, named Neka, argued. “You find me attractive, how can you not find her as such?”

“Because I don’t know her! I know you, and I want to be with you, but I’m not some piece of meat to pass around whenever you feel like it!”

“That’s not how I see you at all!” Neka protested. “I see you as my mate, one to protect, not just pass around!”

“Then why are you trying to get me to sleep with her?” Victor asked once more.

“It is natural for us Rakiri."" She paused, trying to figure out how to best explain it. “A Pack is more than just two individuals, and our society reflects this. A male is to have many Pack Mates to protect him-”

“And get fucked by him?” He cut her off, not letting her finish. “I’m not one of your males, I don’t practice polygamy, and I’m not sleeping with your friend because that’s what your culture says.” 

“Yeah,” White broke in. “Much as you denounce the Consortium for slavery, you lot seem to view men as nothing more than commodities.” At the accusation, some of their jaws dropped.

“I’m not going to cheat and have women on the side. Why can’t you accept that?” Victor said. With that, Sakari stormed off with an upset huff of air.

“I hate human monogamy!” Was all Sakari said as she walked off. Fed up, Victor threw his hands up, and stormed off in the direction of the rest of the men. Neka ran after Sakari, trying to placate her. In the end, Victor took up a room with the Japanese and Nepalese cadre members, and went to their rooms.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Having got their drinks, the group of humans picked an isolated section of the bar, with only one Shil’vati, Trissila, joining the procession. This move seemed to aggravate and annoy many of their cadremates, but they wanted to be left alone, and not be bothered. Zachary and Fisher sat down at a nearby table, and began shooting the shit with each other. A few chairs over, Victor, the kid who had shacked up with the Rakiri, sat alone. The kid kept taking glances at them for a while, before he finally got up, and came to their table.

“How’s the breakup, kid?” Zachary asked, downing his fourth glass of blue grail of the night, wishing it was Jack or Captain Morgan. Or Smirnoff. Or something that wasn’t the fruity bullshit the Shil’vati loved.

“Neka went to calm down her friend. Apparently she took why I wouldn’t fuck her personally. She thinks I don’t find her attractive,” Victor explained.

“Polygamy is the name of the game for most species, kid. Us having an equal number of men and women, and not being limp-dicked chumps, is why we’ve attracted so much attention, and they want us to conform to their ways,” Zachary said. “Anyway, why have you been looking over here all night? I know you didn’t come here to discuss your breakup.” 

Victor seemed surprised for a moment at what he said, before he finally responded. ""I wanted to know what it was like,"" he asked as he sat down at the table with the two former Marines. They both eyed him for a minute, before Fisher just sighed.

""What what was like, kid?"" Fisher said as he put down his glass of blue grail. 

""Being a US Marine. It's obvious you both were Marines before the Purps invaded, so I want to know what it was like for you guys."" The kid was young, at least compared to them. He couldn't have been older than 21. Fisher was in his 30's, while Zachary was about to celebrate his 26th birthday.

""Before or after the Purps came down?"" Zachary downed his glass, and looked around to make sure no one was listening in. ""Because we can both give you some pretty different answers."" 

""After I guess,"" The kid just shrugged. ""I wanted to join the Marines before they invaded. On the day it happened, I was at the mall when they came down, and I eventually passed by the recruiting office there. The recruiter was dragged out dead, along with the body of one of them. Knife through the throat apparently. At that moment, my dreams of joining the world's best were dashed, so I guess I want to know how it was for you guys."" 

Zachary gave out a humorless chuckle in response. ""Kid, I was on Okinawa, and saw most of the 3rd Marine Division get blown to hell and gone, while most of those around me on our field op got killed in front of me,"" He said, his facial expression still unreadable. 

""I was leading my recruits through the final days of training when they came down,"" Fisher paused, downing the last of his drink with a few gulps. ""More than a few of them never got to go home and see their families again."" He just shook his head and didn't say another word.

Sure, Drill Instructors were hard asses that fucked with you and pushed you to your limit, but at the end of the day, they were there to take care of you. Turn you into something to be proud of. Stern, but fair, was the motto of the Drill Instructor. For Fisher, seeing recruits he was tasked with training and protecting get gunned down, days from claiming the title, while he and his fellow Marines were powerless to stop it, hit him hard. 

Sure, Zachary didn't escape Okinawa without serious mental trauma; something he tried so hard to repress, but at least he could fight back. Fisher and his fellow DI's hadn't had weapons with live ammunition, or even anything to get through Shil'vati armor, period. They were completely defenseless and it ate at him. Zachary knew as much, which explained why Fisher was almost always perpetually pissed off or depressed.

""What about after?"" Victor pressed on. ""What did you do when it was over?"" Zachary just put his hand up to quiet the kid, noting that the bartender was returning with their next 3 rounds of drinks. When she arrived, he pulled out his credit chit, took her pad from her, swiped his chit, and handed it back. 

""Thanks, sexy!"" He said, picking up a fresh glass, and downing it in no time flat. The girl, from both the compliment and tip given to her, practically skipped away from the table beaming all the while. Shorter in stature than most, but he found those more attractive anyway. He turned back to Victor, and spoke. ""You really want to know the answer to that, kid?"" Victor simply nodded, more eagerness in his movements than the kid should rightfully have. The former Marines just shook their heads once more, and Zachary continued. 

""What the hell do you think? What do you think we did after witnessing our friends get slaughtered, our flags ripped down and cast out into a world where our skillsets were fucking useless? To see our country get beat down harder than the coalition did to Iraq in 91, to be treated as nothing more than second class citizens by libido driven aliens who took what we held dear?""

""Yes, we fucking fought back. Those of us who were released! Those of us who escaped capture and profiling! Those who had helped keep information out of the Purps hands! We fought with everything we had and everyone we could get. But we didn't take amateurs off the fucking street."" 

""Former military, police, intelligence officers, those of us who had experience with shit like this. Not dumbass hoodrats with glocks, rednecks LARPERS with AR-15's, or some unabomber copy cats. So many idiots that dragged phones or other electronics with them, and got themselves killed or jailed because of it. Sure, some people managed to do exceedingly well, despite having almost nothing to start with. The Emperor in Delaware, a cell in Maryland led by someone called Uncle Bill; those are the notable groups.”

“But for every one of those, a dozen more got cut apart and destroyed. Point being, yes, we fought back. We fought as hard as we could, using what we spent months dragging up from across the country, just to give us a fighting chance at making the Purps feel pain and fear. Atlanta, Pensacola, Vicksburg, the bridge collapse in Orlando, all the shit done up and down the East Coast, just so we could get payback for everything they did to us!""

""Even now we ain't done fighting, kid! That severed rail line between Boston and New York? A good buddy of mine died there to make sure the Purps don't feel safe, even after all these years. We're never going to quit fighting. Not even now, there's a reason people like us joined. With the hope that one day we can make a difference.”

“Does that answer your question, kid?” Fisher said, not bothering to hide his annoyance with Victor. He nodded, sensing that he wasn’t wanted around anymore, got up, and left the two Marines alone. They sat in awkward silence for a few minutes, before Fisher spoke again.

“I’m so glad my brother isn’t here to see me like this,” Fisher said as pounded away his next glass. “I should’ve fucking been there keep him safe.” His voice started to crack, revealing a part of Fisher that Zachary honestly knew never existed. He never talked much with the man, simply because he didn’t agree with his relationship with Mal’Ava. He knew the man had demons of his own; not a single veteran who survived the Invasion didn't have some.

“What happened?” Zachary asked, trying not to remember the fate of his mother and brother. 

Fisher let out one last shaky breath before going on. “He was at Miramar when everything happened. They dragged him and alot of other guys over to some camp called 773. Then those Interior bitches fucking took it over, and everything got worse. Repeatedly tried to rape the guys they held there, refused to feed them, and tortured them. It was the longest running camp they had, long after we surrendered. All because of some pissed-off noble who lost her daughter to some naval pilots.”

Zachary perked his ears up at that comment. He remembered two naval pilots he met before processing out for basic training. Could it have been them? He didn’t know, and likely never would. Not many pilots survived that day, so it was a possibility.

“He was just so hungry. Many of them were. They refused to give them more than starvation rations. If they wanted more, they had to…” He stopped, taking a long pull of his last glass, completely emptying it. Zachary knew exactly what he was referring to. 773 had become infamous amongst the survivors of the US military for what happened there. “What they made him do...he just couldn’t fucking handle it. He wasn’t answering any calls, and when we went to his apartment, we found him there. He couldn’t live with the shame of what they made him do. We tried so hard to help, but in the end, he just ended it.” By now, his typical stone facial expression was broken, and tears began streaking down his face. It was a painful memory no doubt, which is why alcoholism became an even more common pastime for people like them.

“I’m so fucking sorry, Fisher. That shouldn’t have fucking happened. None of this shit should’ve happened. Fucking Purps took everything from us.""

“What about your family? You never told me what happened to them,” Fisher asked, his voice more hoarse than it normally was. 

Letting out a shaky breath of his own, Zachary replied. “My family lived in Tampa when the Invasion happened. Tampa was home to U.S. Central Command, and you know what they did to every base we had. There wasn’t even enough left of them for a proper fucking burial!” He ran his hand through his hair, trying, and failing to stop his own tears from falling down. Some minutes went by before they finally composed themselves, and they realized that all of their glasses were empty, and no more had been brought over. 

They both looked out of the corner of their eyes, seeing that they had been attracting some watchers the whole night. For Fisher, it was one of the Helkam from a sister cadre. She was one of the ones in the rec room who saw the movie, and proceeded to bolt from the room early on. She was also light in the chest, something the other girls made fun of her for, which they all heard throughout the night. Fisher just sighed as he got up.

“She’s a helluva lot better looking than a Purp is. I’ll see you later,” Fisher said, swiping his chit for his drinks, going over to the girl’s table, where she sat alone, and after a minute, walked out with her in tow. Flipping the bird to the other girls the whole time, as they stared in disbelief.Zachary had two pairs of eyes on him: two Nighkru, the space elves with horns, who mostly ran the Trade Consortium. Both of them had beautiful, brown, skin, with what looked to be bioluminescent coloring underneath, which glowed a pretty blue. Their reflective silver eyes stealing glances at him the whole night, obviously interested in him. He caught their eyes with his own, and they quickly averted their gaze. Zachary couldn’t help but smile. There was no denying they were attractive, more so than any Shil’vati he’d ever seen. Even better, their skin tone reminded him more of the Jamaican Army girl he messed around with not long after the occupation began. 

In the end, he was drunk, more than a bit pent up in many ways, and was willing to test his luck. He got up, swiped his credit chit, and made his way over to the two beautiful Nighkru that had attracted his attention.",/r/HFY/comments/ofvzt9/semper_shilvati_an_ssbverse_story_chapter_14/,29

Date Point: February 7, 2437

Sol system, Terra

Terra News Corp HQ

“Breaking news from the Pan Asian Coalition. Reports are coming in that a firefight has broken out in the system when ships from the 2nd Han fleet engaged a mixed fleet of hostile alien warships in the Long Kou system. With us is retired Vice Admiral James Middletown. James, what can you tell us about this recent engagement?”

The wizened old man nodded once before speaking, “Well Jim, from the data we have so far we can tell that the battle was for all intents and purposes a decisive victory by Terran forces and a crushing defeat to the Xenos.”

A display popped up with an after-action report. Blue models representing Terran forces and red ones representing the enemy. The models flew around, disappearing and reappearing seemingly at random before red models started to flash and red X’s crossed them out.

“Two battlecruisers, the PAC ShenZhen and Hansan under the command of captain Yi Sun-Lin destroyed an entire Xeno battlegroup. The price they paid was mild damage to both ships and two hundred casualties. This is a clear sign that while the federation of alien races aligned against humanity may seem vast and unstoppable, it is obviously not the case. Whether through tactical, technological, or purely Terran superiority, our service-men met the enemy in the field of battle and crushed them entirely. Back to you Jim.”

“Thank you for the very insightful analysis, James. Now on to further news, more than three billion citizens have decided to do their part and enlisted in the Terran armed forces. Remember the call to arms means you. If you or anyone you know is between the ages of eighteen and forty-eight, enlist today and do your part in the fight against the aliens.”

Yi threw his PDP at the wall, “are you fucking kidding me?!”

The door to his quarters slammed open, “Sir! Is everything ok?” the guard stationed to guard him asked.

“Yeah it’s fine, just pissed at some lying no good politicians.” he kicked the PDP, before saying in a mocking voice, “*Our Forces, Terran ships, Us, we.* Where the fuck is the *us* and we when we were being attacked? They are using our blood, sweat, and tears to push their propaganda campaigns!”

His comm beeped and he cut off, “This is Captain Yi speaking.”

“Captain, there’s a call from the Admiral. Do you wish for us to patch it over?”

“That would be perfect lieutenant.”

A few seconds later, “Captain, this is Admiral Zhang Bao. Congratulations on your stunning victory.”

“Thank you, Admiral, it would not have been possible without the men under my command. Has there been any word from the ShenZhen?”

“No, we were hoping that you could give some first-hand information on what had happened to it?”

“I can not, I was preoccupied when the reports came in. There is nothing that I could say that the reports could not say better.”

“Understood, your new orders are to return to the station for repairs and refits. I will have you debriefed in person at a later date.”

“Yes, Admiral.”

“Zhang Bao out.” The moment the connection died, he called the bridge.

“Captain?”

“New orders, return to Tian Gong station for repairs. Don’t take the crew off of Battlestations just yet though. I won’t feel safe until we’re back in range of the planet's ODP.”

“Aye, sir.” sighing with satisfaction he kicked his feet up onto his desk. The war was just starting but his victory would most likely earn him and his crew some degree of fame. The bonuses alone were going to be enough for him to buy a copious amount of alcohol-

His PDP rang again, “For the love of God what now!?” he howled and smashed the answer key.

“Sir, the Admiral’s back on the line, he says it’s urgent.”

“What could be so urgent about refits?!” he shouted, “put him on my line.”

“Aye sir, I’ll pretend like I didn’t hear the first part.” the caller ID changed.

“Admiral, I did not expect you to call back so soon. Has something changed?”

The man chuckled, “I assume you are not at the bridge?” Yi hesitated, to admit it was to show ineptitude, that he was not always ready to fight. “Worry not, you’ve had a long few days. I am willing to overlook a few moments of weakness.”

“Thank you, Admiral.”

“Of course,” he said with a wave, his expression turned serious. “But alas the situation has become a lot more dire.”

“How so?”

“More fleets are appearing in system. A full report will be sent to your station within the next hour. But until then, stay on high alert, reinforcements will arrive within the day.”

He frowned, “Does that mean that our previous orders have been canceled?”

“Indeed, good luck out there Captain.” the connection cut off. Yi held his PDP for several more minutes before finally putting it down and getting dressed. He was going to be having a long next few days.

Oscar’s ears rang as Yang wound up for another punch. The first one had nearly knocked him out in one go. Off to one side, marines cheered her on or shouted encouragement to him. Her fist slammed into his ribs, knocking the air from his lungs. He quickly backed up, trying to put some distance between them.

Yang followed him, getting up close and personal with him so that he couldn’t use his longer reach. Oscar jabbed at her face, the blow glanced off her raised arms, and once again she was inside his guard. A flurry of rapid hits knocked him to the ground and she pounced on top of him, driving the air from his lungs.

“Hrrrrhh-” he wheezed, slapping the mat. Immediately Yang rolled off him and leaped into the air.

“Boom that’s how it’s done bitch!” she screamed.

Oscar rolled over, trying to catch his breath. The medic on duty ran onto the mat cursing at Yang, “God damn it you stupid slut! You killed another one!”

She ignored him as the medic knelt down over Oscar and consulted a tablet. “Quit being a little shit, you’re fine.”

“I don’t feel fine.” He wheezed.

“Relax, it’s only a broken rib, mild concussion, and dislocated shoulder.”

“That doesn’t sound fine.”

The medic patted him on the shoulder, “I’ll get you hooked up with some nanites and you’ll be back at ‘em in less than a week.”

“That’s way too long!”

“Nah, you won’t even feel it.” he said and pulled out a needle, “now I’m going to need for you to stop shaking or this is going to hurt real bad.”

Oscar whimpered, “what’s that.”

“DNA-coded painkillers.” he stabbed him, “now get your ass off the mat so someone else can go.”

Yang finished her victory lap and walked over holding a hand out to him, “come on little guy, I’ll get you to the infirmary.”

The medic shook his head, “no way, you’re the reason he looks like that. I can’t let you take him there by yourself.”

She rolled her eyes, “what you think I’m going to kill him?”  
“Yes.”

“I’ll be fine with her.” Oscar sighed, his head was a lot clearer once the painkillers kicked in, “If she’d wanted to kill me she would have done on Outlook Station.”

Yang nodded a little too happily, “See, even he said it.”

The medic tilted his head to the side, “fine, whatever. But Yang, if you’re going to kill him, go all the way through with it. The captain won’t be happy if you make him pay for Oscar’s surgery.”

“Don’t worry about it,” she said and dragged Oscar along. As they exited he asked, “Should I be concerned about how the two of you were casually talking about murdering me?”

She laughed, waving it off, “what? Nah, we do it all the time.”

He paused, “Do what all the time, murder people or talk about it?”

Her silence did absolutely nothing to reassure him.

“Charming…” he sighed, shaking it off, “I can’t believe I got my shit rocked so fast.”

“Don’t sweat it, you’ve never gone through any real military training. I’m sure more people would have been alarmed if you had beaten me. You should have seen the odds stacked up against you.”

“What were they like?”

“Let’s just say some people would have gone broke if you’d have won.”

Oscar’s shoulders sagged, “Great, so people think I’m useless in a fight.”

“That’s not true, you’ve watched the combat analysis. You did just as well as anyone else.”

“Tanner and I got our shit rocked by that Class 18.” he shuddered, “stuff like that still freaks me out.”

“How so?”  
“Just how evolution and biology can create fucking monsters. We dumped nearly two hundred rounds of armor-piercing into it and it just took it in stride, swatted us around like ragdolls too.”

She shrugged, “that’s just the way it is Oz. Hell, I’ve watched Xenos with half their limbs blown off crawl up bulkheads and still manage to kill people. The thing is, most of those high-class Deathworlders have no sense of compassion or loyalty. That’s what separates them from us. At the end of the day, most of them aren’t willing to sacrifice themselves for a greater good.”

He snorted, “You say that like most humans are.”

Her expression turned serious, “we are, once you’ve been doing this for as long as I have you notice things like that. Marines sacrifice themselves so that their squadmates can get away. Guys jumping on grenades. Hell, people give up their spots in emergency pods so that the weak and elderly can get away. It happens, that’s what makes us better.”

Eight hundred and ninety-nine. Eight hundred and ninety-nine were executed. Eight hundred and ninety-nine forced conscripts executed. That was the number of men and women that had faced their ends on the red stage of Docking bay 13. A gunshot rang out at least once an hour since those first few had attempted to escape.

Li’s schedule hadn’t changed in the slightest since his first day in training. Sure the faces had, as troops were moved around or placed into different roles. The ones that caught on faster were placed into higher units, like the single-digit battalions. Those that seemed hopeless were forced into the triple digits, destined to be nothing more than cannon fodder. Those men seemed to either work the hardest, desperately trying to get themselves into a better unit, while others gave up entirely. Accepting their fates and trying to live the remainder of their lives in some semblance of happiness. It was from those battalions that the deserters arose from.

Unit changes happened in the morning, massive boards were erected to show who was moving to where. Li desperately held his breath as they marched past one such board.

**“Li Ming Tao, Zeng Zi Yen, Ren Zhen, ….. Are to be transferred to 9th battalion effective 0000.”**

“Oh thank god.” he released his breath. Their chances of survival had probably just doubled. While being in the double digits meant they would be armed with suits at the very least, weapons had not been a guarantee. But in the single digits, they would be given at least a kinetic energy weapon to use.

The angry looks that the other conscripts shot them were nothing short of venomous. And in that moment, Li could not have thanked his parents more, they’d pushed for him to get his EVA license early and that had probably been one of the reasons they were being promoted over the older and definitely more experienced peers. Younger men could adapt more quickly to changing circumstances and the sudden shift from civilian life was harsh and sudden.

In his thirty years of service, Yi had never commanded a fleet as large as the one he saw before him. The Hansan was flanked by four cruisers, two-light, and two heavy. Along with their escorts, one destroyer and two frigates each. A battle group, thirteen hulls, and ten thousand strong. Each ship had brought their full marine detachment along to ward off against potential boarding actions.

With his new command came a battlefield promotion. The newly named Senior Captain Yi Sun-Lin scrolled through the situation report on his display.

*“Senior Captain, at 0900 anomalies began to show up across* ***all*** *early warning systems. This rules out the likelihood of glitches or false alarms. Currently, there are two possible realistic reasons.*

1. *Hostile forces are jamming AEW systems through unidentified means.*
2. *Hostile forces are much higher in strength than projections indicated.*

*In either case, the solution is the same. Deny a foothold in the Long Kou system until Intel can identify the problem. Admiral Zhang Bao has decided to split the fleet into sixteen theatre commands with a strategic reserve left for further use.*

*As the senior ranking officer of theatre 9, you have been given command of twelve ships. In furthering our objective of area denial, you are to consider yourself and any ship under your command expendable.*

*Good luck, may you bring our nation much honor.”*

Haiyun looked very unimpressed as she reread the message, “Really, that’s it?”

“Yes.”

“That’s what they had us wait an hour for? We could have gotten all that in a single condensed file. What was the point of all that fancy bullshit we had to go through?”

“You mean security checks and clearance verifications?”

“Yeah, that.”

“Capt-” the comms officer frowned, “Senior Captain.”

“Just stick to calling me Captain will you? All this ‘senior’ stuff will start going to my head if it goes on any longer.”

“Yes sir, I’ve got the other ship’s captains on the line for you.”

“Pull them up on the main display, it will do the crew some good to see our fellow men.”

The massive screen at the front of the bridge shifted from the tactical view to thirteen individual video displays. Eight men and five women, all decorated sailors of Asian descent with decades in the service. As one, they saluted.

“Senior Captain, it is a pleasure to meet you. I am Captain Duan Hui, commander of the PAC Nan Dao. I will be your second in command.” one of the older men said. Yi nodded to him, faintly remembering having met the man before.

“It is an honor to have you with us, Captain. By now I believe you have all received your call signs and linked tactical information. Is this correct?”

“It is,” tags marked each commander as he spoke, “Call signs will go as follows, the NanDao will be Tiger I, the NanDao’s destroyer will be Tiger II, and the frigates will be Tiger III and IV respectively. This pattern will go for the three other cruisers and their escorts as well.”

“The Guiyan will take the call sign Leopard I.”

“The Bijie will take the call sign Panther I.”

“The Panzhou will take the call sign Cougar I.”

“Very well, the HanSan will take the call sign Lion I. I am going to split you up into two task forces under the command of each of the heavy cruiser commanders.” he nodded to the tactical officer who assigned ships to their new designations. The two heavy cruisers were highlighted in red for friendlies, a Passover from the old traditions of the ancient seabound navies.

He continued, “Lion I will be in the middle, with both heavy cruisers on either side. The light cruisers will take up stations above and below Lion I. Have the frigates screen for us radially half a light minute from Lion I. Destroyers will be sent out as scouts with orders to return upon first contact. Is this understood?”

The captains nodded in confirmation and ships began to move. PAC battle tactics were radically different from their American counterparts. Instead of fleets of small agile frigates and destroyers jumping around, doing hit and runs with a core of superheavy carriers and battleships. PAC task forces applied much more powerful ships in smaller numbers. A modern light cruiser could take on up to a half dozen frigates or two destroyers on their own. That was, of course, other human warships, from what Yi had seen so far, a light cruiser such as the PanZhou would have been perfectly fine engaging two or three dozen Xeno warships in close quarters.

“Tactical, show me a view of the full system out to the Oort cloud.” he said, “and also where the rest of the fleet is located.”

“Aye sir, coming right up.” The holy tank in the middle of the bridge expanded to encompass the entire system. The yellow-white star in the center was about 3% larger than Sol and with the only habitable planet just 6% further from the star than Terra was. LongKou was slightly colder with longer seasons. The other five planetary bodies in the system were completely unlivable dead planets. Two gas giants on the outer edge and two rocky ones closer in. Mining operations had been placed on both with massive factories in orbit capable of pumping out just about anything a person could ever want.

Nearly a hundred ships were parked in orbit next to the factories with more than thirty thousand marines setting up defenses on the inside. Central command had expected the aliens to attempt a landing to take them for themselves.

hose factories were dwarfed by the ginormous TianGong Station. Such was its size that it created its own gravitational field that pulled asteroids and small moons into its orbit. Once a military installation rivaled only by those in the Core Systems, tens of thousands of rail guns and laser batteries studded its surface.

“Sir.” his tactical officer shouted, pulling his attention away from the holo, “we’ve got company!”",/r/HFY/comments/oh1whm/hellfire_across_the_heavens_ch11/,4
9,ohcqod,HFY,Sat Jul 10 08:28:15 2021,The qualification test to join the Galactic Federation,"Alan sat forward on the couch, hands cupped over his mouth, eyes fixated on the TV. Early sci-fi had gotten it right. Humanoid and gray, short, with two arms and legs, a large head, two massive eyes colored black, three feet tall.

Standing beside the president on the white house lawn, Alan could only keep his eyes on the two. They terrified him. Perhaps because of how wrong the sight of them was. How alien it was.

But, the sheer terror can definitely be attributed to the armada hanging in low orbit, trillions of ships visible from outside. Shaped as a rectangular prism, the tip pointed at the planet; according to sci-fi, the tip has the weapons.

Like that even fucking mattered. It just kept getting worse and worse.

Tweets from the directors of every major news source said the camera crews weren't stationed at the white house. They, the interns with papers and coffee, the cameramen holding the handles, and on field reporters, were all teleported on the scene, equipment on and plugged into generators. No light, no heat, only a shifting of colors before depositing them. The president was next, confused, then the aliens on his left and right, and finally the ships above.

Teleportation is greatly underused in sci fi, or isn't used to their fullest extent. The power and skill to teleport an object, especially with the precision shown today, makes these or any other aliens just shy of being gods. If they can pull the president from his meeting in Tuscan onto the white house property, they can teleport nukes to the surface. Or a bioweapon in the vicinity of every human on the planet. Or a percent of the sun onto the earth.

The alien turned to the president. It spoke, it's English perfect, in the voice of a middle aged white male. ""Sir, thank you for waiting.""

The president nodded, his smile grim and forced. ""I assume you were giving the world time to tune in. Is that correct?""

""Indeed it is."" the alien looked at the camera. ""We will jump straight to the point. We represent the Galactic federation, and the many species that are part of it. We are here to conduct a test.""

It paused dramatically, swept its gaze over the cameras. ""Our sensors say there are only three outcomes the human race cares about. While not the only one, we will mention them to give you a fair understanding of the stakes. The outcomes of the test are this: A) You will be allowed to join the Galactic Federation. B) You will *not* be allowed to join the Galactic Federation *at this time.* And C) Annihilation.""

Alan hissed. He threw his back into the seat and gripped his hair in both hands. Fear, sharp, raking his insides. It whispered in his ear, gigging as it proclaimed the end was nigh. With a plea to shut up, that worry was shoved down. He took a deep breath.

Then he glanced at his phone. It sat on the coffee table, upside down, on silent. He likely got a host of calls and texts by now. His family, on the other side of the continent. It sounded like the test would be carried out on the spot. Would there be time to call each of them? Is there time to say goodbye?

Alan looked up at the TV. The alien was silent again, the president stricken with terror. Time to react. Good enough. He snatched the phone off the table, scanning his face to bring it to the home screen. As expected, texts were coming in, the icon displaying that there were missed calls. He ignored all of them, created a group chat for his family, mom, dad, and sister. He sent them a single message: I love you.

With a smirk, he made another group chat, for his friends, for the exes he failed to delete, for his current booty call: chill.

The messages sent, he sighed, carelessly tossing the phone onto the floor. A crack. He probably broke the screen. If they were gonna die, it didn't matter. It'd suck more if he lived. Screen repairs are fucking expensive.

Ten seconds later, the alien spoke. ""The test will be like this. As this is the most powerful country on the planet, please save your politics for reddit, we shall teleport a random individual here. This individual will meet the following criteria: graduated high school, or a GED, have the median income of your country, and hasn’t been drunk or have had a hangover for the last eight hours. We're not 'assholes'. Each species we believe might be ready is always given a fighting chance.""

… It was fair. Honestly. They're educated, and having a steady income with little stress or anxiety makes them sound of mind. Having a politician, businessman, somewhat wealthy or horribly poor, incredibly stupid or a god damn genius, will ruin the test and assume too much of the rest of the population. It makes sense.

He paused once more. A noise, like the scraping of chalk on concrete, to the second alien. The alien replied, then abruptly raised its right hand. The president stumbled back and raised both hands. Alan followed with him, inhaling sharply and leaning forward.

In the alien's hand is a smartphone. The screen faced them, and it appeared to have a single app. The alien tapped on it with an elongated thumb…

Then Alan was there. He blinked and sat up straight. The couch came with him, and he sat before the president and the two aliens on the white house lawn. At least he was dressed. Fear came to the forefront of his mind, but was then squashed by nihilism. He gave a dry laugh and shook his head. It wasn't fair. It was. But it wasn't. He was going to be the doom of the human race.

Alan stood, nodded to the president, then spun to the camera. He waved with a bitter smile. ""Sorry!"" He called. ""Sorry guys."" He heaved a sigh, lowering his gaze to the ground. ""I'm so sorry,"" he whispered.

""Do you doubt your skill?"" the lead alien asked.

Alan grimaced and spun. He looked down at the alien. Hate. It burned inside of him. He wanted nothing more than to slam his fist into the creature's face. What color would its blood be? What would its face look like caved in? But what would that actually get him? How fucking far would he get before the thing eradicate him? Realizing it was pointless, the rage dissipated, his shoulders sagging.

""I don't doubt my skill. I'm just fucking nervous. The fate of the world relies on me."" He chuckled and spread his arms. ""It's more terrifying than anything I've ever experienced!""

""As expected."" The alien said, sounding pleased.

Again, it spoke in its alien tongue. The second alien pushed the button on the phone again. An object was teleported. Sleek, black, it took up most of the lawn and was double the White House's height. And, likely for the convenience of Alan and everyone in the world, it was shaped like a missile.

""That's an antimatter bomb."" The lead alien casually said.

""Aw fuck,"" Alan whined.

""I see you know what it is."" It gestured to the cameras. ""Care to explain the stakes to the audience?""

With a moan, Alan spun to the dozens of cameras, panning from the bomb to him. ""It's, it's a fucking bomb. *The* fucking bomb. One of the most powerful bombs we can realistically build. I don't know the exact science, but if I had to guess."" He made a sharp point at the bomb behind him. ""That thing can wipe out half of the continent, and send a mile high tidal wave towards Europe.""

The murmurs and cries were immediate. Many dropped to their knees. All of them made the gestures for their respective religion.

Alan turned back to the alien. He wanted this to be over already. Exasperated, he demanded, ""What's the fucking test?""

The alien remained silent for a second, then raised a finger.

Slowly, it said, ""Listen closely.""

Alan nodded. He cleared his mind as best as he could. As a representative for the human race, he had to do his best, qualifications be damned.

The creature pointed at the bomb. It spoke, just as slowly as before. ""That, is an antimatter bomb."" It gestured for Alan to follow as it moved towards the bomb.

It pointed at a handle on the side. ""And this."" it grabbed the handle and pulled up. ""Is the access panel."" it stepped back, the panel hanging above them. Three buttons, red, yellow, and green, sat under a blank monitor. ""To the buttons that activate the bomb.""

The alien said nothing more, nodded, and stepped back ten feet. It stopped, hands held behind its back, and watched Alan expectantly.

Alan returned the look, and then turned towards the bomb, hands going to his hips. He breathed out and stared at the buttons and the screen.

Three buttons, red, yellow, and green. A blank screen. Color logic says red is bad, yellow is waiting, and green is good. But that's only in the US, right? Not the rest of the world. A gesture to stop in one country means to come forward in another. Maybe it's an awareness test? Like, the United States isn't the only country on the planet, why are you reacting as if this test only affects America?

Or perhaps it's a test of loyalty? He lives in America, he's supposed to react like an American, show the aliens that they can be loyal to other races in the Galactic Federation. But then wouldn't the most American thing to do is say 'fuck the test!' and charge the alien?

Red, yellow, and Green. If it's not a test that focuses on locality, then which button should he push? Or button*s*. One at a time? And if so, in which order. It might be safer to push all three at once. A 1 in 3 chance. Unless, of course, it's a 1 in 4 chance, with the fourth being if he pushed all of them at once. Then wouldn't it be a 1 in 8 chance, since there are multiple combinations of buttons to push at once?

And what about the computer screen? It's blank, it's off. It could be a touch screen, with the instructions on how to activate or deactivate the bomb displayed. But what if doing that activates the test, the bomb put on a countdown timer and one of the buttons required to be pushed in order to deactivate it.

*""This is an antimatter bomb,""* the alien had said. *""And this is the access panel to the three buttons that activate the bkmbshfhdvd—""*

Alan stood straight as realization struck him. Perplexity and joy followed quickly. He turned his body to the alien, giving it a shit eating grin, and then to the cameras, gesturing madly at the alien. When the camera crew reacted with confusion, Alan shook his head and turned back to the bomb.

He chuckled lightly to himself. “Like a meme,” he whispered. Arms at his side, he waddled towards the bomb. He looked at the alien, then to the bomb, then back to the alien, and to the bomb again. He grabbed the handle to the access panel and looked the alien in the eye. Slowly, Alan pulled the panel shut.

He turned towards the alien, waiting. The alien did nothing for a moment, then moved forward, stretching its hand towards the panel. Alan stepped in front of it.

The alien nodded. “Alright, congrats.” it turned to the president, who was laughing under his hand, hunched over slightly. Alan broke character and laughed with him. “You’ve passed the test —”

“No shit,” The President gasped before falling into another laughing fit.

To Alan, the creature almost looked amused. It turned to the cameras and said, “We’ll send you all a message on how to connect to the Galactic Internet in a week, and then come back to introduce you to ambassadors from the other races.”

The alien then manifested a top hat, put it on its head, and fucking *tipped it* towards the human race. “Have a nice day.”

The two aliens and the bombs vanished, and seconds later, the armada vanished as well.

XXXXXX

Yeah, so I thought to myself: why doesn’t America negotiate with terrorists? Because of pride? To not show weakness? No! It’s because, why negotiate with someone who isn’t level headed, who isn’t even open to negotiation, who will end up killing the hostage anyway? 

To paraphrase one of my favorite Naruto Fanfics

**Zabuza:** (Losing) Shit, what the hell are they feeding kids at the academy these days?!

**Sakura:** (Easily winning) Xenophobia, hatred, and state propaganda.

**Credit:** Sunshine in Konoha by Quolim on Fanfiction.net. Discontinued, but still a short fun read.

Anyway, even if they’re part of theocracy, even if they worship a different god, even if they have a different political view than us, we still do trade, we still do talks, we still negotiate terms. Why allow a race who simply goes to war the instant they come in contact with an alien species into the galactic stage?

As far as I’m concerned, if they’re unable to complete a simple task, reading between the lines, then they are not ready to join *yet*. If they use some kind of faulty logic in their choice, then they’re not ready *yet*, and should be explained the purpose of the test\*.\* If they say they don’t know and beg the alien to spare their species, then they are not ready *yet* and need some pushing in the right direction.

On the other hand, if they say ‘fuck this test!’ and try attacking the alien, then they must explain the true purpose of the test, and if they still react violently, they must be monitored to determine if uplifting, guidance, or annihilation is the best option.

You know those stories where the humans join the community, and then a race of new war aliens enters and makes another species go extinct, and there are some aliens who still think there can be room for negotiation, and the human race has to lead and kick ass? Or where they allow a race of aliens who have repeatedly provoked other races in order to get them into war join the galactic federation because they’re too strong? I love them, they’re one of my favorites.

But the most simple way to avoid it? Don’t let them join in the first place. Instead, give them this test, and if they react negatively or stupidly, and if you monitor their species and see there is no hope in getting them to change, then xenocide is the only answer. If they don’t even respond to attempts at negotiation, then xenocide is the only answer. If they are stubborn, then *genocide* and uplifting is the answer, or xenocide if not.

*But* if they’re able to solve a basic bitch question like this, where it’s the wording that is the key, then there *is* room for negotiation, and they could possibly be welcomed into the galactic federation.

Let me end it off by asking this question and paraphrase Isaac Arthur’s YouTube Video Crazy Aliens: Would you even consider joining an alliance with an alien race who invites you to a feast where the ambassador is the guest of honor, so you can literally consume his wisdom?

""Did you start a bar fight, yes or no?""

""Yes Ma'am."" I reply, looking at Capitan Atorian, standing at a parade rest, who stares back at me, while the rest of the Reapers involved in the incident standing next to me, also at a parade rest. We're all packed into the Capitan's office, which, while large, is not enormous.

""Why, may I ask, did you start it?"" She asks, her tone barely controlled as I look at her

""5 of *your* Marines tried to rape Alcide. I don't know why the Helkam and Raikiri joined, but they did."" I reply, enough venom in my voice to make the Capitan twitch slightly.

""I am aware of what transpired, I want to know why you joined in."" The Capitan hisses, and I stare at her

""Given the same situation, would have not started a fight?""

""I would've gone the diplomatic route beforehand.""

""I tried. They refused. I chose the non-diplomatic route."" I reply, and she sighs, pinching the bridge of her nose.

""Out of the 6 Marines you put out of commission, three had serious injuries. Five had concussions. You took down these Marines over a potential rape?"" Atorian asks, and I shrug

""If it had gone through, there wouldn't be bodies.""

""You're serious?"" The Capitan asks, and I choose to stay silent, which is enough of an answer.

"".....What did I expect....look, based solely on the circumstances, and that none of the Marines in question are going to be out of service for more than a week or two due to their injuries, I'll let you off easy this time, and this time alone. If anything like this happens again, I'll run you until you puke, then run you again, understood?"" The Capitan snarls, and I nod

""Yes Ma'am!"" I reply, and she sighs

""Relax soldiers. Now, the reason I had actually *planned* to call you into my office is to alert you that you have been given a mission."" The Capitan says, and the mood in the room changes in a heartbeat. I feel my heartrate rise, and note how everyone in the rooms leans a bit forward towards the Capitan.

""So....what's the mission?"" Falia asks, and the Capitan shrugs

""Best you see for yourselves. It's been forwarded to your omnipads, Major U'Lova and Lieutenant K'trai. I suggest you head to a conference room. Conference room 1 will be open in 10 minutes."" The Capitan says, and then she makes a motion for us to leave. I take the hint, and walk out, the rest of the Reapers quickly following.

""So.....meet in 10 minutes?"" I ask, looking at Falia, who nods.

""Yes. Meet me there. Lieutenant, follow me."" Falia says, and Vare nods silently.

""So...........I'm gonna grab my rifle."" I say, walking off towards my room

""Uh......what?"" Astia asks, and I turn around, walking backward

""I always clean my rifle during mission meetings! Helps me focus!"" I call, as the rest of the humans of the group follow me.

""You're going to completely clean your gun?"" Kaarina asks, and I nod.

""Yeah. Gonna take it more or less entirely apart. At least the moving parts. Barrel should be fine, save for some minor dust. Probably gonna take it out anyway."" I reply, as we eventually come up to our rooms. Walking into my room, I grab my MRAD rifle, and perform a quick check, unfolding the stock, I make sure it's stable by shaking it a tiny bit. Thankfully, it doesn't move. Next, I double-check that the rifle in unloaded, which it thankfully.

Slinging the rifle over my back, I grab two more thing out of my bag. My rifle maintenance kit, which use is rather obvious, and a an old, towel, to use as a place to set the rifle and parts so that the rifle or the table I'll bet setting it on gets scratched or dirty.

Setting the towel around my neck, I pick up the cleaning kit, and walk out of the room, joining the other five humans of my group.

""OOOH! BIG RIFLE! LEMME SEE!"" Allie cries, and I stick out my arm, grabbing her head and stopping her in her tracks.

""Uhh, no. I don't really trust you with this. Besides, it's mine."" I reply, pushing her a tiny bit, and then walk down the hall, Allie on my heels.

""Aw......why not?"" Allie asks

""Why don't I trust with a 6000 dollar, 15 pound rifle? Allie, you're the most chaotic person I have met, and I've known for three days. You downed 3 Blue Grails, then beat the shit outta a Helkam like it was a birthday party and that Marine was a piñata."" I reply, and she frowns

""She was gonna hit Themila though...."" She humms, as we find our way to a hall with what I'm fairly sure are conference rooms, based on peeking in a few, and seeing large tables with chairs around them.

""Okay, fine....but still."" I mutter, shaking my head as I find the farthest door down the hall, and assume it's number one. Pressing a button near the door, it slides open, and the six familiar aliens all look at me

""'Sup."" I say, giving a two-fingered salute, walking in and plopping down in a seat next to Astia, who seems intrigued by my rifle as I set it down on my towel after putting said towel on the table, with my maintenance kit off to the side.

""Glad you're here.....that's unloaded, right?"" Falia asks, and I raise an eyebrow

""You think I would keep an armed rifle around people who have no idea of how to fire it? No, I'm not that stupid, Major."" I reply, as I set aside the unloaded magazine after removing it from the rifle.

""Okay.....now, moving on to the mission. It takes place on the Ice Planet known as Pyxn. We will be close enough for a drop within a week."" Falia begins, bringing up a picture of said planet on some kind of projector thing mounted to the wall. As I study the planet, my hands move on their own, pressing down a button on the lower receiver of the rifle, allowing the lower to hinge away, and after pulling out a pin, remove it entirely from the upper.

Astia seems shocked to see me do this, and I look at her, raising an eyebrow.

""Why....why are you disabling your weapon?"" She asks

""To clean it."" I reply, and she gives me a very confused look, which I ignore.

""Now, Pxyn is known to be very cold, with temperatures consistently near negative 5 Celcius, and thus is considered hard to work around. We will need heavy winter to be able to operate properly, and I hear Fyodor chuckle as I pull out the bolt, along with two plastic bolt guides, which allow for different bolt sizes by varying in thickness.

""That's no so cold, Major. I have operated in -20 before."" He says, and I chuckle as I pop open my rifle maintenance kit after setting aside the bolt and guides.

""Yes, well, for us it is incredibly cold. Moving on, our target is thankfully near the equator, in a range of mountains and hills known as the Icy Wall."" Falia explains as a red dot appears on the map as I pull out a screwdriver from the kit, checking it's the right size for the screws I need to remove.

""In a valley contained within said range, there is an area where a group of rebels has taken over, and one of the bases in the area is our target. Designated Base Athla, it is located near the entrance of the valley, here."" Falia says, as the zooms in an incredible amount, showing a red dot near the mouth of a fairly large valley, from the looks of it.

As Falia presses some commands on her omni-pad, I focus on slowly loosening two screws near the front end of the upper. After doing so, I slide out the barrel, setting it towards the towel, and set the screwdriver aside for the moment.

""This is an aerial photo of the base. It's 400 meters by 400 meters, and has a decent size-garrison, around 2-3 hundred soldiers total. It serves as an FOB, being closest to the entrance of the valley. As such, it has many light and armored vehicles, as well as an anti-air system, and mortars, but no high-grade artillery."" Falia says, as a photo pops up on the projector thing.

Looking over the photo, I study the base, along with it's positioning. It's located not a quarter mile from the Southern Entrance to the valley, nestled next to some hills. The Southern and Eastern Sides are exposed to an extent, visible from the entrance, while the Northern and Western sides are close said hills. From the photo alone, I can ID several things. Four guard towers at the corners. A large building, likely the command center, directly in the middle of the base. Next, armories. Two bunker-like structures in the Northwestern and Southeast corners. Lining the Eastern wall of the base, vehicles. I can't ID any of them, but there are several. What I can only assume are Anti-Air fortifications and Mortars on the Western wall. Barracks on the Northern end of the base, what's like a mess hall, and some other random buildings. Workspaces, comms buildings, and what I think are fuel tanks.

""How far out are the nearest reinforcements?"" Kyara asks, the Raikiri leaning back in her chair.

""By ground, half an hour. By air, about 10 minutes."" Vare is the one to answer, as I continue to study the map.

""Quick question. What exactly is the mission objective? Search and destroy? Data retrieval? Smash and grab?"" Themila asks, and Falia shakes her head

""No. VIP Retrieval."" Falia says, and I raise an eyebrow

""What kind of VIP? Local leader? Military official?"" I ask

""No. Children of the Planetary Governess."" She replies, and I blink a few times.

""Not a sentence I think I would've ever heard, but okay. How many?"" I ask, and Falia pinches the bridge of her nose

""5. One boy, four girls."" She says, and I let out a string of curses in English.

""Fuckin.....okay, how old?"" I ask, and Falia sighs

""The male is 1 half of a pair of twins with the oldest girl, both 17. After that, it goes 15, 14, 12.""

""Fuck. So I gotta deal with 3 horny teenage girls. Fuck me sideways....."" I groan, shaking my head

""And what exactly is that supposed to mean?"" Yvelti asks, and I give her a deadpan look.

""Me. From the 'sex world'. Male. More stamina than a Turox, whatever the shit that is. Them. Teenage girls who are more than likely virgins. Ya see the issue?"" I ask, and Tyjia shoots me an annoyed look.

""You can't honestly think they would try to have sex with you, right?"" She asks, and I raise an eyebrow

""Again, horny teenage virgins who see as nothing a living dildo. The Empire sees as us objects, not people, and this little group is the exception, not the norm."" I reply, glancing at the Camera in the corner.

""Oh, come on, that's not true."" Kyara says, and I sigh, leaning back in my chair a tiny bit

""Maybe not. Hopefully not. But honestly? I don't trust the Nobles, not one bit. I've heard stories. 773 is enough proof for me. But that's besides the point. Look, if they don't give me trouble, I won't say anything. They do? I may or may not bitch-slap a teen. But anyway, you guys have a plan?"" I ask, looking at Falia, and she nods

""I have one that I would like to run by you guys. I'm not experienced at this whole 'strike team' thing. I've lead teams on Earth, which, if I'm going to be honest, seemed to easy. My plan is to pull a hard-breach through the Sou-""

""Okay, I'm stopping you right there. You want to do a *frontal assault?*"" I ask, shock obvious in my voice.

""Well.....yeah? They're untrained rebels, so they don't kno-""

""Bupbupbupbup. Lemme speak. It doesn't matter how trained they are, a bullet is a bullet. Do you know how many fucking World War 2 Soviet combatants were just mothafucka's who picked up a rifle and said: 'Fuck the Nazi's', and proceeded to fire away? A lot. A whole fucking lot. Doesn't matter who fires a gun, it is a gun. It will hurt. Trust me. I know."" I mutter, leaning back in my chair, closing my eyes.

""So.....what do you suggest?"" Falia asks, a bit timid

""Stealth is going to be our best friend. We come in from the West, over those hills. The kids are in the central compound, right?"" I ask, looking at my commanding officer, who nods

""To our knowledge, yes. Held in a basement level."" Falia says, and I nod slowly.

""Okay then. We come in from the West. We place explosives or otherwise sabotage both the armory closest to us, as well as the Ant-Air's and mortars. We get the kids, then get the fuck out, and blow their shit up to delay them as much as possible."" I explain, and Vare scoffs

""That seems a bit vague."" She says, and I laugh.

""Maybe so. But we can't on count anything to go as we expect. We can hope, pray, but count on it? No fucking way."" I reply, and Kyara speaks up next

""Where are we going to set down our ship? There is not enough room to do so, and I don't think we can drop from the air."" Kyara notes, and I shrug.

""Beyond the hills. Some of kind clearing."" I reply

""You want to make the kids walk over those hills?"" Yvelti asks, concerned.

""Uh, yeah? If I can run 10 miles in full kit in fucking Texas, a few kids and walk a mile or two in the cold. We'll bring extra heavy clothes. As long as they shoes, and it's not actively a blizzard, I'm not super worried."" I reply, raising an eyebrow

""Okay.....so, what are our jobs going to be, then?"" Astia asks, and I shrug.

""I'll be overwatch. I'm a sniper, and based on how Falia has been talking, they don't have nearly as good gear the Marines do, meaning I'm willing to bet my rifle can fuck them over."" I reply, as I clean the trigger, careful not to mess with anything.

""The rest of us, then?"" Alcide asks

""I want Kyara and Vare with me. Vare, because I would prefer our pilot alive and uninjured. Kyara because if someone is sneaking up on us, she can probably find them. The other nine would make up the main strike force."" I reply, and Vare seems to think about it, before nodding.

""Kyara is also the fastest, so if all goes to hell, she can radio for reinforcements from the ship."" She notes, and I nod.

""I only have one more question. How long will the *Retribution* be able to stay in orbit around Pyxn?"" I ask, as I slide the trigger back into the rifle, then the safety into place.

""About a week, I think. Why?"" Falia asks

""I would prefer to have time to study the base, get the guard rotations. Find out the best time to strike, which is gonna be at night, more likely than not."" I mutter, thinking about it as I clean the bolt.

""So...........two or three days, before the final assault?"" Fyodor rumbles, and I give a 'so-so' motion

""Give or take. I'll set up a nest on a ridge on one of those hills, and just sit and study."" I reply, as I clean the bolt guides after I'm done with the bolt.

""So........it'll be about a week and a half before the final assault?"" Kaarina asks after a few seconds silence.

""I think so......you guys need armor, right?"" Falia asks, as I look up from cleaning the barrel.

""Yeah. You got winter camo armor?"" I ask, and Falia blinks

""Winter camo?"" She asks, seeming confused, and I sigh.

""We're not doing this guns blazing. We need camo. Ya know. Clothes that help us hide in the terrain?"" I ask, and she makes an 'Oh' face

""Oh. I understand. Yes, we do have that."" Falia responds, as I slide the barrel back in place, and then tighten down the barrel screws. Sliding the bolt and bolt guides back into place, I reconnect the lower on my rifle, and close the rifle, and look at the people in the room.

""Well then. It seems we have our work cut out, huh? First mission. Let's no fuck it up, huh?"" I ask, and Allie smiles

""FUCK YEAH!"" She shouts, throwing a fist into the air, as Tyjia whips her head to the Aussie in shock, as Fyodor gives out a rumbling chuckle. I sling the rifle over my back after reconnecting the strap, and clean my hands, at least a bit, on the towel as Astia goes to talk to Vare about something or other.

""So.......you think is gonna work?"" Kaarina mutters, sidling next up to me, as I glance as her. Her blue eyes are cutting across the room, as they focus on my eyes, and I feel like they bore into my soul.

""I hope so. If we fail, or if one of those kids get injured, more or less die.....it's our head on the chopping block, so to speak."" I sigh, turning towards the Finn.

""Yeah.........I would prefer to live...."" She mutters, and I chuckle as I stand up.

""Yeah.......I choose life."" I mutter, smiling to myself slightly.

God, I fucking hope it all goes well. Murphy and whatever ethereal being controls our little lives will probably say otherwise, but I hope they'll just fuck off for once.

Chapter 17: Morning of Fun 2

&amp;#x200B;

“See something you like?” Zachary asked, amusement filling his voice as he watched the Shil’vati male look him up and down, his face turning bluer as he did. Tracking Kadra’s eyes, he found out quickly just what he was staring at, and moved a hand to cover his member. An action that made Kadra turn a darker shade of blue, realizing he had been caught looking. “Ah, ah, ah, eyes up here!” He said in a singsong voice, smirking at the Shil’vati twink.

“I, uh, didn’t know you were…” He stumbled, trying to find the right words to get him out of the situation. His eyes darted between Zachary’s face, which only grew wider as his grin got bigger and bigger, and his right hand he used to cover his cock. Normally, there wouldn’t be much to see without a full blown erection, but the vigorous scrubbing he gave his member after this morning’s fun with Jek’sa and D’taari, warranted such a cleaning. As such, he was just over half mast, with that likely being a driving force as to why Kadra’s own started rising even further.

“Didn’t think I’d be back so early, while everyone is still asleep? Old military habits die hard, just like some other things are hard.” He said, glancing down at Kadra’s cock, which was now standing tall. He wasn’t exactly small, he’d definitely be average back home, but he had Kadra beat in that department. And he likely also had him beat on how to use it properly, which was the secret with any guy or girl in the bedroom. Walking over the mini fridge, he pulled out a bottle of water, downed it, crushed it, and tossed it in the trash, all while still stark naked.

“Yes, but, I didn’t think that-”

“That I’d come in and find you naked atop the bed, with your toy on display?” The words that exited Zachary’s mouth threatened to make all the blood in Kadra’s body rush to his face. He’d never seen a Shil’vati so blue in the face. Not even Mal’Ava when they first fucked all those years ago, and she turned very fucking blue when seeing him naked. 

“Well, no but... why are you still naked?” Kadra asked, trying to change the subject.

“Hey, I just got out of the shower after a long night and morning,” He replied, throwing his hands up in a mock surrender. “I didn’t expect you to catch me in the process of drying off, and decided to take in an eyeful. But I guess it does confirm a suspicion of mine.”

“What suspicion?” Kadra said, with an absolutely adorable pouty look on his face. God damn, Shil’vati men were so fucking cute when they were angry.

“Back in the Marine Corps back home, most of the women who joined were into other women,” He started, sitting down at the foot of the bed, not far from Kadra, and began putting on his socks. “Since the genders are reversed out here, I assume that most men who join, like other men.” He gave a sly wink, before returning to the task at hand, and getting fully dressed. Before he could get his second sock halfway on though, he felt a pair of hands grip shoulders, and toss him on his back. Looking at Kadra, he saw that the male had a previously unknown look in his eye, as he dove down at his face, and slammed his lips into Zachary’s. The action shocked Zachary for a second, before he started to return the gesture.

“Thank you!” Kadra said, breaking their lip lock, and staring into his eyes with a look that can be best described as lust.

“Thank me for what?” Zachary said, just as much curious, as he was confused.

“The forest exercise!” He breathed out huskily. “You have no idea how badly I wanted liberty! This past month and a half has been stressful and I just needed a break. When I fell over that log, and I couldn’t get up, I thought I was done for. But then you came along, and picked me up!” He said, slamming his lips back down on Zachary’s, and straddling the Human even more, putting his thighs astride his stomach.

“Never leave a man behind,” Zachary said in reply. “Rule number 1 with any military back home. You bring your own back, every fucking time, and never leave them to the enemy.” Kadra just smiled at his response.

“So all the rumors of Human men are true, aren’t they? Being so dominant, so strong, not putting up with shit! I was starting to believe it ever since your sparring match with the Drill Instructor. To see you stone faced during that movie. And then in the forest, you and the other Human, pulling that stunt, embarrassing her again, just like when you took her tusk! It's just so feminine!” Once more, he slammed his lips into Zachary’s, only now Zachary responded by reaching with both hands, and grabbing Kadra’s rather plump ass cheeks. He moaned in response to the grip, and pulled back from the kiss, his long tongue making an audible slurping sound as it left Zachary’s mouth.

“All this because I didn’t leave you behind like a coward?”

“That and so much more!” Kadre purred. “The way you walk, talk, and handle all those horny bitches that pester you. How you handle problems and don’t back down! How you don’t let even the DI’s intimidate you! To see such femininity in a male is...Intoxicating! And I fucking love it! Just like I know you aren’t opposed to this happening right now,” He said, feeling something else other than Zachary’s hands poke his ass. His breathing only got harder as he looked behind, and saw the culprit.

“Well I gotta say,” Zachary said, dragging himself further up the bed, the weight of Kadra practically nonexistent as he did so. “I like the fact that you’ve been helpful the entire time here, especially with the testing. It also says something that despite your attraction, you haven’t bugged me like your various Shil’vati sisters do.” He said.

“Fuck them!” He moaned as Zachary squeezed his ass harder. “They only want what’s between your legs! But after everything you’ve said and done? I’d rather have you watching my back any day, especially after what you did in the forest! Although, I can’t say I’m completely disinterested in your little friend here!” He said, looking back at Zachary’s throbbing, and at this point, somewhat sore erection. It was also at this moment that Akari had stirred awake, and upon turning in their direction, went wide eyed at the whole ordeal.

“What are you doing, Kadra?” Akari asked in disbelief, watching as the Shil’vati male crawled down to Zachary’s groin, and ran his fingers up and down his shaft.

“Examining this dominant form of masculinity!” Kadra said, a devious smirk on his face as he extended his tongue, and ran it across the head of Zachary’s cock. “You said it yourself, you like how he stands up to women, and find it hot as well.”

“You're drunk!” Akari accused. Kadra just shook his head.

“Barely. Besides, this is what I truly believe, and truly want. Don’t deny yourself either. Afterall,” He fixed his gaze back on Zachary. ""Our resident Human loves other men, doesn’t he? Especially ones that look like us?” Zachary just shrugged.

“I mean, you aren’t wrong,” He said with a smirk. “And I very much am enjoying this.” Kadra’s demeanor only brightened at the confirmation, and put his plan into action.

“Good, then I hope you don’t mind if I continue,” He said, wrapping his lips around Zachary’s cock, head starting to bob up and down, as his tongue coiled around it like a python. The Shil’vati’s warm, wet mouth felt absolutely amazing as his tongue glided across his member, worshipping and coating its entirety with warm, viscous saliva. Kadra pointed a hand towards Akari, beckoning with a single finger, while not taking his attention off Zachary’s member.

“I, uh, don’t think I should.” Akari said, trepidation in his voice. Kadra paid no mind, his complete focus on the Human’s cock. He only increased the speed of beckoning, before pointing at the object of his focus, and finally put his hands to work on what parts of the shaft he couldn’t engulf in his mouth. Akari looked over at Zachary, who just shrugged.

“If you want to, go, ah...go right ahead.” He said, admiring the job that Kadra was doing. He wondered if the Shil’vati twink had practice with this, because if he didn’t, he was a damn natural. Slowly, but surely, Akari crawled closer, his eyes focused on how Kadra was worshipping Zachary’s member. Wet, sucking sounds filled the room as Kadra gave no intention of stopping. However, feeling movement on the bed, indicative that Akari was coming closer, he let go with an audible pop.

“Try for yourself, Akari! You said you were curious!”

“Not like this!” Akari argued, a blush creeping up his face as he got closer to Zachary’s erection. He reached out a clawed hand, touching his cock, and sending a shiver up Zachary’s spine. “It’s so warm!”

“And your hand is cold!” Zachary said frankly. He watched as the Helkam twink moved his face closer, and his long, and forked tongue slowly snaked out of his mouth, and began teasing the head. He ran the tip of his tongue across and down the underside, before finally swallowing his member as best he could. The move made Zachary shiver as he realized just how serious the temperature difference was. His mouth was cold, not unpleasantly so. “Holy shit!”

“I knew you’d like it!” Kadra said with an impish grin, as he grabbed Akari’s face, and began forcibly increasing his pace, enjoying how he made the Helkam male gag slightly at the motion, and how Zachary went wild as his cold mouth enveloped his member.

“Holy shit!” Zachary moaned out, loving the cold feeling against his cock, and the sight of two space twinks servicing him at the same time. Even more so how one was ‘forcing’ the other to do it. He watched Kadra pull his head back, and saw Akari’s eyes glazed over in an expression of lust.

“So warm!” He slurred out, his tongue slithering back into his mouth. “I love how warm it is!”

“Then I’m sure he’ll enjoy the both of us working together.” He said, giving one last devious look, before the two of them dived back down on him. Their tongues worked in unison, one being cold, the other long and thick, wrapping, sliding, and teasing every inch of his cock. Zachary couldn’t help but squirm under their combined ministrations, enjoying the feeling of two different species putting their skills together on him.

“H-how the fuck are you so good at this?” Zachary said, gripping both of their heads tightly as they worked even harder over the edge. It was also at this moment that he noticed Akari was naked too, and like Kadra, his member was fully erect.

“Lots of practice,” Kadra said, before running his tongue up from Zachary’s balls, right to the tip. Normally, after going so many rounds in the last few hours, it would take him a while to finish again. But the work of two different species tongues, with their temperature differences, and the fact that both Kadra and Akari were very attractive to boot, meant that he couldn’t hold back for long. The two twinks were determined to wring his orgasm from him, and their incredible skill meant they were going to achieve that goal.

“Fuck, I’m gonna cum!” He said through gritted teeth, gripping the sheets as his orgasm exploded forth. While it wasn’t as much as earlier, he had only drunk a single bottle of water since getting back, it wasn’t a small bit either. Kadra wrapped his lips around the head of Zachary’s cock as he exploded, taking rope after rope of ejacualte that the Human spat forth. Too soon however, it ended, and he pulled off. Turning to Akari, who looked jealous, grabbed his face, and kissed him.

Kadra’s tongue ravaged Akari’s mouth, wanton lust filling them both as they shared Zachary’s cum, coating both of their mouths with the sticky seed. The sight of the two of them making out that way made Zachary’s cock painfully erect, something Kadra noticed out of the corner of his eye, and broke the kiss with Akari. Stands of saliva and cum connected between their lips as they both swallowed their share. Seeing that Akari missed some, Kadra ran his long tongue across the Helkam’s chin, retracted it, and swallowed it. Looking back at Zachary, their eyes alighted on his still-erect cock.

“So the rumors are true!” Akari said, and an even bigger blush took hold on his face.

“Especially if what he was doing last night is an indication.” Kadra said, before the sound of the door opening made all three of the room's occupants turn, and view the intruder. It was William White, the resident Australian Commando, and one of the best friends he had here, standing in the doorway. He stood in the doorway, an expression of disbelief on his face, before it turned into amusement, and the man busted out laughing at the sight before him.

“God damn, mate, you just can’t fucking help yourself can you?” Doubling over, hands on his knees, he laughed like a maniac, while the previous lust that filled Kadra and Akari was replaced with embarrassment, and Zachary’s member began to deflate. Both of the twinks rushed to cover themselves out of embarrassment and shame, while Zachary rushed to grab his underwear, hurriedly throwing them on, as the Aussie continued to laugh. “Like, shit mate, those two space elves weren’t enough for you? I mean, I should have guessed, I know what you like.”

“Do you have a reason for being here?” Zachary said, slightly aggravated at the Aussie’s sense of humor. It took a few more seconds for the laughter to cease, but it eventually did.

“Yeah, mate, sorry. Ah, fucking everyone is starting to get up, and we’re gonna go hit up the town again, and have fun. We ain’t leaving anyone here, so I thought I'd come grab you.”

“Alright, I’ll be out there soon, thanks for the heads up, although you should knock next time.”

“No problem mate, we’ll be waiting in the main lobby.” As the Australian started to leave, a voice called out to stop him.

“Wait!” Kadra called out, halting White in his tracks, and causing him and Zachary to stare at him. He looked terrified for some reason, a reason they’d soon find out. “Please don’t tell the others about this. Please!”

“Hey!” White said, putting his hands up defensively. “I’m not judging you for this, you love who you love, and all that shit.”

“It’s not you, it’s just…” He paused, not knowing how to put it, but thankfully for him and the other alien in the room, only hastily covered by blankets, he didn’t need to.

“He’s not worried about what we think, it's what the alien women think,” Zachary said. “They are very hostile to the idea of men liking other men. They can’t do shit to us, because we can fight back, and they know it's common back on Earth. But for guys like Kadra and Akari? They will be in danger, and they have less means to protect themselves. Do you understand what he’s saying, William?” The Aussie nodded in affirmation.

“Yeah, got it mate, the secret’s safe with me. Those bitches won’t find out about this, I swear.” He said, before turning on his heels, and closing the door. The trio of men were silent for a few seconds, before Zachary broke the silence.

“We better get dressed and head downstairs.” He said, getting his clothes together, just as Kadra and Akari did.

“You aren’t going to tell the others about this, will you?” Kadra asked him, a look of uncertainty in his eyes. “You won’t brag about this, like women tend to do, will you?”

“Don’t worry, both of you!” He said, putting a hand on his shoulder. “My lips are sealed about what happened here, and whatever may happen later, I promise.” He said with sincerity.

“Thank you!”

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As they all exited their rooms and gathered in the lobby, they noticed that two of their entourage was still missing. First being Adam Fisher, who had still yet to come down, along with the Helkam girl, Jacana, he took to his room. Second, was Elias Mayer, who went to his room with some plant lady, whose species none of them had ever seen before. After a few minutes though, the elevator dinged, and out walked Fisher and Jacana.

Or more specifically, out came Fisher practically carrying the girl in his arms, her legs dangling limply, and her face that of a woman who had had the time of her life the night before. The sight of the girl, being carried bridal style, a look of afterglow still written across her face, made the gathered Humans whoop and cheer the happy couple as they walked into the lobby, and Fisher sat her down on a couch.

“I can’t feel my legs!” She said, her mind relieving what happened over the course of the night.

“Well damn, Fisher, did you have to slay her like you did recruits back in the day?” Zachary laughed as he approached the man and fist bumped him.

“What can I say, it's been a while.” Fisher replied, far more relaxed than he’d ever seen the man. “I needed to know I still had it in me, even after all these years. Besides, after the night she had, she deserved it.” He said, looking over the Shil’vati and Helkam cadre members who were already in the lobby, and were glaring at him and Jacana.

The elevator dinged again, and out came the last of the party, Elias Mayer, and some plant woman. However, the state that Mayer exited the elevator in, was something that threw a few of them off. Something besides the knee high, upright frog walking past them, holding a rather large knife.

""Hey, Mayer?"" Zachary called out as he walked out into the lobby of the hotel. 

""Ja, what is it?"" He replied back, in a far more relaxed manner than when they first arrived. 

""Why do you smell like freshly cut grass? And what is that green shit all over your clothes?"" He asked, wondering just what had happened to the resident German the previous night. 

""You didn't see him take that plant lady back to his room from the bar?"" Said Alistair Jones, the British member of the training cadres. 

""Nah, I walked out a bit early, why?"" 

""Let's just say he filled her with his seed, and she pollinated all over him in return."" He said, before busting out laughing at the German's misfortune. Mayer just shrugged in response to the British man's sense of humor. 

""She was a squirter, what can I say?""

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The Night Before**

“He doesn’t think I'm attractive, does he?” Sakari bitched, letting out a sigh as she sulked at a table far from where the Humans had taken up residence. Some of them had tried getting closer, but were met with outright hostility from the Humans. Even as her friend Neka tried to placate her, she still felt upset. Never had any previous male they shared ever denied one of them.

“I doubt it's because of that, Sakari,” Neka reassured her. “It's just that Human monogamy is a finicky and aggravating aspect of their culture.”

“Its complete Turox Shit, is what it is.” Dax’Ala, one of the recruits of Cadre 1 said. “We have three Humans in our cadre and not a single one has taken interest in us. The only one who did went with the furball over there instead of us.” The Rakiri growled in response, sending a sharp glare to the Shil’vati before turning her attention back to her friend.

“One of them is supposedly married back home, and he still refuses us every time we ask him.” Halani said.

“He threw me to the ground and nearly broke my arm the last time I asked him!” Dexta cried out.

“To be fair, didn’t you insult his wife?” Trissila said as she sat down, visibly agitated. “But it’s not like even asking nicely will get us laid. Not even with their females.” She complained, glancing back at the two female Humans who started chatting with two of the male Humans.

“Even being nice doesn’t get us laid,” Kakiska murmured. “The Human even complained that I showed him my tits a few weeks ago and called me a child tonight. I just don’t get it. What are we doing wrong?”

“We aren’t doing anything wrong,” Dexta said. “The Humans just don’t like us, and I’m getting sick of it. I’m lodging a complaint when we get back to base.”

“It’s not like any of us are getting lucky either,” said Satuma, one of the cadre’s Helkam recruits. “Also, that Human you insulted the wife of, I keep overhearing the Humans calling him a ‘Ger Ka’. I have no idea what a ‘Ger Ka’ is, but it might explain why he put you on your ass.”

“I didn’t even say anything that bad!” Dexta said defensively. “All I said is I can show him a better time than that skinny bitch he has on Earth!”

“That’s exactly the fucking problem with you people!” One of the Humans- the same one being talked about, left the bar with two other Humans, one of which was involved with the Rakiri.

“WHAT IS WRONG WITH US!?” Kakiska shouted at them, only to be met with three middle fingers pointed in their direction. In response she simply slammed her head down on the counter in frustration. Before long, it was Satuma complaining about something else.

“Are you kidding me? If you wanted a Helkam, why pick her? She's from a lower caste than I am!” She cried out as she watched Adam walk out with Jacana, one of the cadre’s Helkam, who was also the flattest, and lowest ranked caste in the cadre.

“Fuck you!” Fisher said, taking a half-finished glass of alcohol from a passing table, and splashing it in her face before walking off into the night with the girl. Satuma was ready to chase the pair, but the moment she got up, three other Humans did in quick succession and stared her down.

“So fucking tired of this shit from you Humans. We’ve done nothing to deserve this!” She took a napkin and began wiping her face, muttering a number of expletives in her own language. “She didn’t even have any tits.” Not long after, they watched in dismay and shock as Zachary, the recruit who became infamous throughout the cadres for his fight with a DI, walked out with two Nighkru.

“Better looking than any of you are!” Was all he said as the two Nighkru shot smug looks at the Shil’vati in the bar, who didn’t want to believe their eyes.

“But those are cave scum!” Halani cried out in disbelief. Many of the girls were upset at the sight of the Humans leaving with girls that weren’t them, especially ones that weren’t Shil’vati. Or at least, all but one of them. The Human who went by the name of Alistair, started talking to, and began to leave the bar with the bartender in tow. One who was short in stature and also flatter in the chest. The two of them began laughing with each other, as they walked towards the exit.

“Why are you picking her?” Dexta cried. “She doesn’t even have any tits!”

“That’s exactly why, you arrogant fucking cunt!” Was all he said as he left the bar.

“This is Turox shit!” Dexta whined. “Why do they hate us so much?” 

“I don’t know, but I’m sick of them ignoring us all the time.” Halani said.

She brought her head up, looking at the remaining Humans in the bar, hoping to find one of them willing. Lo and behold, she saw a lone Human sitting at a table by himself. Recruit Pierre of Cadre 2, was sitting alone at a table, the occupants that were there previously, having left. He was also the youngest of the Humans present.

Another of the cadre girls, one much drunker than the rest of them, figuring she’d try her luck, walked over to him. Maybe it was desperation to get laid, maybe it was the alcohol, she didn’t care. Her not caring however, had also drawn the attention of the Humans, who didn’t appreciate her intrusion into their area. It was also noticed by Pierre, who looked up from his drink.

""Fuck off, I just want to be left alone.” He said, taking another sip of his drink.

“And I want to have fun on my night out,” she said defiantly. “I can show you a good time, Human. I hear you young ones last much longer in bed.” She licked her lips, bringing her face closer to his, hoping to get his attention.

“I said fuck off, bitch! I don’t care what you want,” Pierre said, agitation rising in his voice, but not taking his sight off the drink in his hand. That is, until he felt an arm grip him tightly and refuse to let go.

“I said, *I want to have fun*, Human!” She snapped aggressively, not wanting to take no for an answer. “I’m sick and tired of you all ignoring us all the time! Now come with me and I’ll show you the time of your life.” 

Now she pulled hard on his arm and yanked him out of his chair.

“Tal’nak, leave him alone!” Trissila warned. “Before you start a fight.” Too late for that. She saw the remaining Humans get up, and get ever so closer to her.

“Fuck that!” She shouted back, getting the attention of most of the bar. “I’m sick of being a virgin, while our cadres are full of alien men who love to fuck! I want to get fucking laid!” She turned back to Pierre, who had a small grey aerosol can pointed at her, and his finger pressed down on the nozzle. The blast of Grinshaw spray sent Tal’nak stumbling back, hands covering her eyes, and crying all the while. She also didn’t notice the Australian Commando running full sprint at her, ready to deliver a blow to her jaw.

“I’M FUCKING SICK OF YOU!” He shouted, bringing his fist to contact with the drunken Shil’vati’s chin, sending her tumbling to the ground, head slamming into the floor, and knocking her out. Other Shil’vati in the room started to get up, some to join their friend, others to stop a fight, but as they did, every Human had a Grinshaw can ready in their hands, or a bottle, or chair ready to throw. “THIS IS WHY WE CAN’T FUCKING STAND YOU!”

“We can add attempted rape to the long list of reasons we fucking despise you!” Matherson said, his can of spray levelled directly at Halani and Kakiska. Novikov grabbed Pierre and dragged him back to the center of the group, all of which eyed every Shil’vati present, with looks of pure disdain.

“It's little wonder your own men can’t stand being around you!” Came the voice of Recruit Nikau, the Maori New Zealander from Cadre 4. 

“And you wonder why our men can’t stand you!” Said the Finnish woman, also from Cadre 4. The standoff continued for a few more seconds, before the renaming Humans gathered together, cans still pointed at the various Shil’vati in the room, and exited the bar.

“Nice job, you fucking idiots!” Said one of the Shil’vati sitting in a corner, who watched the entire event playout, and had also recorded it. She knew the footage would be useful very soon, because one way or another, the DI’s were going to find out what happened, and there being evidence on record would help the Humans' case. As much as she wanted to get laid, the conduct of her fellow cadre mates disgusted her, and what happened was entirely their fault. And they were going to pay for it.",/r/HFY/comments/olsr7x/semper_shilvati_an_ssbverse_story_chapter_17/,37

""Big guy marches in here like he owns the place and expects to boss us around? Why the hell should we let you run the place anyhow?""

I looked around the little squat structure. With mud walls and a straw roof, you could scarcely believe that there was running water, indoor plumbing, and refined steel just a mile or so from the stone age building. The thing didn't even have a door, and the night breeze blew right through the opening to rustle the straw.

Neither was there a table. Hell, we didn't even have chairs. Though that may have been for the best, as the ceiling was low enough that even sitting there wouldn't have been room for me. Instead, I sat on the floor with the group of sprites Temerity had put me in contact with. Not the dirt, mind you, though the roundhouse lacked a proper floor. Instead, bundles of rushes were packed in tight to cover the ground.

I sat cross-legged on the floor and was surprised to find that the rushes did a decent job of insulating me from the cold ground.

While the building was squat, it was also wide. I shared the space with nearly two dozen sprites, a few of whom held candles, the only light in the room.

At the centre of the roundhouse was a pole that held up the centre of the roof. Bent and warped, it looked like they'd picked a straight looking tree limb and hacked off any knots or branches. 

It was against this pole that the sprite addressing me leaned. He was one of the few sprites who held a candle, and his colourless features seemed to absorb the ruddy light. It turned his skin orange while his hair seemed ablaze atop his head.

""I don't know,"" I replied honestly, ""I don't think you should. I certainly don't want the job.""

The roundhouse was quiet for a moment as the sprite stared at me and then glanced side to side.

""Is this some sort of joke?"" he demanded.

""Nah,"" I jerked a thumb over my shoulder, ""I've got this cool hotel, comes from my world, it's pretty great. Got sort of a whole fortress vibe going on, what with it being atop a big concrete block. I'd really like to go back there, hang out, maybe explore a little.""

""Then what are you doing here?"" asked a feminine voice from the back of the room.

""Simon sucks, the nobles suck, everybody sucks. I'm here to fuck up Simon, and a while back, I came up with a way to neutralise the pheromones the fey use. Figured it would be wrong not to use it. And using it, well, that was bound to kick off revolution as soon as you guys noticed, so I figured I'd lend a hand to keep things from getting too crazy.""

That got a round of murmurs from the crowd, and even their leader had to fight to wipe the surprise from his features.

""And if we don't accept your helping hand, you don't fix the fey for us?""

""Nah, did it already, actually.""

The crowd, who'd still been muttering about what neutralising the pheremones might mean, went utterly silent.

""What?""

""Already did it,"" I repeated, ""This shit is kicking off with or without me.""

""Then... then what do you want? Why are you here?""

I shrugged, ""To keep things from getting too crazy? Revolutions are always a mess, tons of people die, and sometimes you just end up back where you were. Maybe with a different guy in charge, but back all the same.""

""What, you don't want us to hurt the fey? You just expect us to leave them alone because you asked nicely? Maybe you don't know what it's like for us, human, but we owe the fey some retribution.""

""Oh, hell no. I'm sure tons of dudes deserve to get super-murdered. Hanging, drawing and quartering, getting whipped to death would be peak comedic irony. I'm not saying don't kill anyone. I'm saying don't kill *every*one.""

""And just who deserves to live or die? You decide? That's part of your *advice*?""

""Hell no, that sounds like way too much responsibility. I'm not going to advise you on who to kill. I'm going to advise you on how to decide who to kill.""

""And just how is it you're so wise in the ways of revolution?"" a sprite, male by his voice, demanded from the crowd.

""The history of my world is rife with revolutions,"" I explained, ""Most of which don't work out.""

""What's an example of one that did? What did they do that's so different from all the others?""

""As much as I hate to admit it, probably the Americans?"" I pondered, putting my chin in my hand, ""It's hard to think of any that worked out better or with less bloodshed. I mean, yeah, they fought a whole war and killed a couple hundred-thousand people, but when I worry about bloodshed, I'm talking about the sort that involves people dragged from their beds in the middle of the night. Their trick was that the revolution there actually kept most of the old power structure in place. Theirs was a colonial revolution. So there were a ton of American colonists, a smaller group of old white dudes running the day-to-day, and then a bunch of different old white dudes back in London who they reported and paid taxes to. American old white dudes told the English old white dudes to go pound salt, both sides lined up their little soldiers and had them fight, and in the end, the American old white dudes were still in charge, except they didn't need to keep paying taxes to the English old white dudes.""

""How does that help us? Among the sprites, there are no *dudes*, as you call them. Once the fey are gone, no leaders will remain.""

""Sure there will be. Everyone seems happy to let you talk. What do you do?""

The sprite frowned and spared a self-conscious glance for the crowd, ""I run the smithy for the nearby farms.""

""Well, there you go. You guys actually have something of an advantage, at least compared to human slave-states. The fey expect you to do *everything*.""

""How's that help us?"" One of them shouted from the back.

""The way it worked with humans, Americans, actually, only had the slaves doing the most menial labour. Stuff that took no training at all, but the fey are way too fucking lazy for that. Even if they could manage it, none of them want to be smiths. The idea's really simple,"" I explained, spreading my arms, ""everybody keeps doing exactly what they're doing. Except instead of giving all your hard work up to the fey, you keep it. Use it to improve your own lives. I don't know how much of the crops you farm end up in the hands of the fey, but I bet life would be way cooler if you could keep it for yourselves.""

Now that got some thoughtful nods from the group.

""We can't hardly eat so much food,"" one of them protested.

""Then do what the fey are already doing, sell it to the elves, the gnomes, and the goblins. Come to think of it, the currency you guys use is actually set up pretty well for this sort of decentralised setup.""

The leader shook his head, a confused frown on his face, ""What do you mean?""

""Right, currency makes it tricky to tell what your work is really worth. If you work for so many hours and get paid such and such amount, are you really getting the fair value of all the work you put in? Well, probably not, because the guy in charge paid you a hundred bucks but sold what you made for, I don't know, at least more than a hundred bucks.""

""Bucks? What are bucks? We use mana.""

""Exactly,"" I agreed excitedly, ""The value of everything is baked into the system, so it's really easy to tell when you're getting screwed. That's not to say you don't need people working outside of direct resource extraction and manufacture. You'll need some people to administrate, buy, sell, whatever. But with mana backing the value of everything, it's a lot easier to tell when you're getting screwed over by some middle man. You guys already know how to run everything. You just need some way to get the fey off your backs so you can live life for your own sake, instead of someone else.""

""What of the fey? How would you deal with them? You seem to have much to say about how bloody this might be.""

""That's because not every purple-skinned humanoid in the city deserves to die screaming,"" I raised my hands, palms out, ""Some *totally do*, but not all of them. And unless you want to kill them all, then you'll need to share the city with the ones that are still around when all's said and done.""

""What if we do want ta kill 'em all?"" A sprite shouted.

""Then you should start thinking about how you're going to take down half a ton of nigh-indestructible human mage.""

That shut them the hell up.

I turned back to the leader, ""Justice? Awesome. Killing slave masters? Super awesome. Genocide? Not awesome. Get it?""

""Ah, yes,"" he replied, glancing over his shoulder at the man who'd shouted, ""But who decides?""

""You guys do. My world had a similar problem, where you had a large group of people, almost all of whom had given passive acceptance to some truly horrific actions. Actions that were perpetrated by a much smaller group among the larger collective. Justice had to be done, but this raised the question, how do you separate the real monsters from those who stood by because they were scared or didn't want to rock the boat?""

""Well, how?"" the leader urged.

""You have trials. And for it to count, they need to seem legitimate. Find two people you can trust from each species to act as judges. Hell, try to find a couple of fey abolitionists if you can manage it.""

""What's the point of putting on this show? We know the faces of the fey who've hurt us,"" the sprite said darkly.

I had to suppress a shudder. I was a little more 'on' than usual, trying to use humour to keep the circumstances from absolutely crushing me, but damn if they didn't make it tricky.

""Because beyond sharing this city with the fey in the middle, you've also got to share this little corner of the planet with Parabuteo and Caniforma. You might have- you *do* have -sympathisers in both cities, but the fact remains that you'll be rising up to oust the city nobility, slaveholders or not. Another well-known revolution on my own world, the French revolution, had exactly that problem. The French revolted and started chopping the heads off their nobility, and their neighbours rained down holy hell on them for it. Nobles don't like seeing other nobles torn down by peasants, even if they're alleged enemies. The trials will put their worries at ease, especially if there's a couple of their own kind on the panel of judges.""

""And then we kill them.""

""Yes. Well, some of them. You'll want to keep other sentences on the table. Sentencing some to, I don't know, prison time, lashes, whatever, will broaden the list of people who you'll appear to have a legitimate grievance against. That was actually a problem in Britain in, I want to say, the eighteen hundreds? Hanging was the punishment on the books for a ton of crimes, and often juries wouldn't convict obviously guilty people because they didn't want them to hang.""

""Does anything happen here that hasn't already on your own world?"" the leader asked tiredly.

""I've got thousands of years of history to look back on, and the benefit of others having written it down, and the further benefit that I got to read it.""

""History seems to have taught you many lessons.""

""Yeah, foremost of which is I do not want to be in charge. Which is good,"" I added, ""Because next most important is that I sure as hell shouldn't be. I'll be here to help out, give advice, and at some point I'll need to force my way into Simon's manor to kick his ass. But beyond that, it's up to all of you. The fey are already done for. They just don't know it. But I caution against striking too soon. Meet up with others, talk, plan it out, and when you're ready, *strike*.""",/r/HFY/comments/omd2gk/meet_the_freak_82/,14

Chapter 18: Welcome to the Jungle!

&amp;#x200B;

This just wasn’t their cycle. For the Commanding Officer, Senior Drill Instructors, and Drill Instructors of Training Cadres 1-10, their lives just got a whole lot more complicated. Everyone suspected that there would be some kind of problems with integrating Humans into the Imperial Military. The biggest issue thus far was a fight between a recruit and a Drill Instructor, which resulted in said recruit beating the DI, and then spending a few days in medical, receiving treatment for injuries received.

However, a thorough investigation found that a number of Drill Instructors had broken a number of regulations in regards to recruits’ privacy, as well as obedience to their Senior Drill Instructors. It was further decided by the Commanding Officers in charge, as well as senior most enlisted, that once the cycle was over, they would be transferred to different training cadres, with negative marks on their records, labelling them as incapable of training Humans. Others would be transferred back to standard operational forces, while the Drill Instructor that suggested the idea, and was instrumental in stealing the files, was arrested, and would be sent to prison.

This had already left a black mark on the history of The Citadel. However what had happened over the course of the first weekend leave for the recruits, threatened to overshadow that incident. The Humans cut their leave short, and returned to base to report an incident. An incident that made every Senior DI and Officer lose their minds. One of their fellow recruits had attempted to rape one of the Humans, recruit Pierre, from Cadre 2.

The Senior Drill Instructor Pasani, of Cadre 2, took the report with great concern, and was by far the most upset considering it happened with her recruits. When she first heard the report, and was shown the bruising on Recruit Pierre’s arm from where Recruit Tal’nak, from Cadre 7, attempted to drag him off, made her lose her mind. She sent Recruit Pierre to medical for a physical and mental evaluation, while she and SDI of cadre 7 ordered Recruit Tal’nak to be arrested.

Eyewitness accounts from nearly all of the Humans, as well as a fellow recruit who recorded the entire altercation, made the situation even worse, as the footage was somehow leaked. Once more, the Commanding General was furious at the fact that this happened, and was now out there for all to see. This now marked the second video out on the datanet that showed a Human knocking out a Shil’vati, only this time was worse, as the Human who threw the punch was intervening in an attempted rape.

But this was just the start of another problem. Multiple Shil’vati and even some Helkam recruits filed complaints about species discrimination by the Humans, over refusal to sleep with, or even talk with them. Most of the DI’s and Officers laughed this off at first, but when over a dozen complaints came in, it required the DI’s to gather the Humans for a discussion, to get to the bottom of this, before talking with the girls.

“Ok, we just want to get to the bottom of this, and make sure what we have been told is true or not.” SDI Prisma said. “Recruit Tal’nak has already been taken into custody, and she will be dealt with appropriately. But there is one more issue we would like to get to the bottom of another issue. Many of the girls have lodged complaints regarding possible discrimnation against them, and we want to clear up the issue.”

“Drill Instructor, does this have anything to do with us not wanting to sleep with any of the Shil’vati recruits in our cadres?” Zachary asked, a look of very blatant unamusement, written across his face.They knew full well it was. Lord knows that every one of the Humans present were agitated to put it lightly. One of their own nearly being raped in a bar by some drunk and horny Shil was bullshit. Even worse is that it didn’t happen until a good chunk of the Humans had already left, especially those who were the veterans. Some of them felt that they were waiting for that exact thing to happen, or maybe they were just being paranoid.

“That is what most of the complaints are about, yes. We want to settle any issues there are regarding this, and ensure that there isn’t any discrimnation based on species, or past experiences, or allegiances in play.” As she finished saying this, the Humans in the room started looking at each other incredulously, shaking their heads, or running their hands down their faces in exasperation.

“Drill Instructor,” Alistair began, face still in his hands, and muffling his voice, before he raised it, a tired look in his eyes. “Where do you want us to start on this issue, because it's a lot for us to unpack here.”

“Yeah, despite what they may be thinking, this isn’t an issue based on species, but instead a multitude of issues, including the recent attempted rape of recruit Pierre.” Fisher said, his glare among the strongest as he didn’t attempt to hide the disdain he felt.

“Then please help us clear this up!” SDI Pasani pleaded. “I’m already pissed off that something like this happened to a recruit I’m in charge of, and none of us want to see anymore problems like this.”

“Well, where do we even start?” White said, looking around at the other Humans present. Not waiting for a response, he decided he’d go first. “First and foremost, the vast majority of the Shil’vati we’ve encountered both on Earth, as well as our time here, aggravate us to the extreme. The nonstop pestering for sex is absolutely annoying.”

“We’ve made it explicitly clear that we aren’t interested in any of them. There is also the fact that a number of us have girlfriends or wives of our own, and aren’t interested in cheating on them.” Said Recruit Siva. The Nepalese Gurkha had already put a number of girls in their place, including slamming one into the ground after insulting his wife. The man was 5’4, but he could easily kick anyone’s ass. They knew, they all sparred with him, and not a single one could beat him.

“But I guess I’ll start with the main point,” Zachary began. “We know how much of our pornography has been taken from Earth, how much of it they love to watch, and assume that all Human men are like this. We get it, most species don’t have many males, and those you do have are limp dicked and can’t go more than once a day. That doesn’t mean we’re here to fill the gap. We’re not going to whore ourselves out because most of our fellow recruits can’t control their libidos. We’re just flat out not interested in having sex with them, especially not here in basic.”

“But a number of recruits have reported seeing many of you already doing so with other species, which has led many of them to believe there is racial discrimination at play.” Came the voice of SDI Din’Asa, of cadre 1.

“Are we allowed to be entirely blunt here, Drill Instructor?” Alistair asked, running a hand through his hair.

“If it means we clear this issue up, you are allowed.” That’s all they needed to hear.

“Ok, well first off, there’s no racial discrimination here. Fuck sake, I took a Shil’vati bartender back to my hotel room, and she was walking bowlegged by the time I was done with her!” He said bluntly, not caring about the slight blush a number of the DI’s took up upon hearing that. “I chose her because I not only found her attractive, she wasn’t bothersome like most of our fellow recruits are!”

“Which brings up a rather major point here,” Fisher began. “Most Shil’vati we’ve seen, and most alien women we’ve seen period, don’t fit our definition of beauty. You know what our women look like, we have two of them here now!” He said, gesturing to the Finnish and Kenyan women.

“We don’t even treat our men like that- walking sex toys.” Said the former Wildlife Ranger.

“Another issue,” Novikov added. “They see us as nothing more than pogo sticks to jump on, not as fellow recruits. Those we have chosen to lay with, treat us as living beings, not walking dildos.”

“Despite the fact that we’ve consistently outperformed them in every major category so far.” Zachary said. “All of us made it through the forest. How many of them went down trying? They refuse to take us seriously, whatsoever.”

“They seem to have this idea that we’re sex barbarians, here for nothing more than to satisfy their sexual urges,” Said Recruit Akio, the JSDF Recruit, whom Zachary and White had been with all those years ago on Okinawa.

“Not to mention that since the day we got here, all we’ve been subjected to is constant leering, catcalls, provocative comments, recruits flashing us whenever you're not around, and believing that they are the hottest beings in existence. News flash, it's very much the opposite.” White said.

“To add to what White said,” Matherson began. “Their attitudes toward us are extremely grating and bothersome, their personalities are disgusting, and as we saw the other night, are only interested in one thing, even if it means taking it by force.”

“We call that ‘Rape Culture’, back on Earth,” The Finnish woman began. “By all indications, a male in your society that does anything more than stay in the house, is asking to be raped, which from what we’ve observed, seems to be right.” A number of the DI’s glared at her, something the other Humans noticed, and began nodding in agreement with.

“She’s not wrong about that.” Recruit Nikau said.

“Agreed, the behavior we’ve observed, and the treatment we’ve received, seems to point to that.” This time it was Recruit Pierre who spoke up. “It's the reason we all carry these.” He said, revealing the grey can he held in his pocket. One of the DI’s visibly recoiled at the sight of the can, another took in a sharp inhale.

“Which is another thing, we simply don’t trust our fellow recruits not to try and rape one of us, espcially now that this has happened.” Zachary said. “There’s a reason we travel together, even when simply going to the fucking bathroom. The talks we hear, the way they act, and what they’ve now done, has given us even less of a reason to trust them off the training field. Hell, a lot of us are wondering if we can even trust them there!”

“But to go back to the original question at hand, for why we’ve fucked who we fucked, the answer is simple. Those that we chose do not pester us nonstop or bother us with sexual comments or requests.”

“Or like I said, we can actually find attractive. Who aren’t carrying disgustingly oversized breasts or constantly thinking with their cunts every second. The same girls who get picked on because they are normal sized to us. Girls like that? We’ll lay into them all day long, because we not only find them attractive, but we enjoy their company. Everyone else? We sure as hell can’t say the same.” Fisher told them.

“Oversized?” One DI muttered as she looked at her own breasts. “You mean to tell us that you don’t find the vast majority of Shil’vati attractive at all?” She asked in disbelief.

“No!” Came the simultaneous response from every Human in the room. Only an idiot could miss how many of them looked downright offended, even the few officers in the room did. Shil’vati arrogance at play, believing they were not only destined to rule the stars, but were the most beautiful things in existence.

“I’ve already lost track of how many recruits have intentionally lowered their zippers or bent over at the waist trying to show off something we aren’t interested in. And here I was told that women who tried this in basic would face consequences,” Zachary said, looking off to the left, at the three individuals he never expected to see here. Former Captain and now Major, Mal’Ava, Staff Sergeant Kolani, and the short, orange haired Interior Agent he met back home. He gave them nothing more than a quick glance though, returning his attention to the various DI’s. He’d figure out why they were here later. “But I guess all recruiters love to lie and bullshit people.”

“Point is, Drill instructor, who we take to bed, is our own business, and not anyone else's.” Alistair said.

“And who we do take to bed, aren’t the ones who bother us with their downright disgusting and harassing behavior.” White added.

“Or are actually attractive to us.” Fisher said.

“In short,” Matherson began. “They have only themselves to blame for the way they act, and how we’ve treated them in turn. They say we don’t trust them and they have done nothing to deserve it, yet their actions have proven otherwise.”

“Our actions towards them aren’t due to them being Shil’vati, it's because of everything we just stated. We have no interest or ever will have any in them, it's just that simple.” Pierre said.

“So will anything be done about this, or will this devolve into another *Iron Tooth?”* Zachary said, using every bit of willpower he could muster not grin with sadistic glee as the words that left his mouth, making the DI’s and Officers in the room go wide eyed at each other. He, and by extent the other Humans, could thank Kadra for that piece of information. It was disturbing to read about, but it became a legitimate worry for them. “After all, to most of the women here, we’re just a bunch of weak, defenseless, males! It doesn’t matter that most of us have killed before, and will do it again to defend ourselves!” He said venomously, not caring to hide how he felt about this.

“You recruits are dismissed!” The CO said, rushing forward, a look of both anger and fear written on her face as she put herself between the DIs and the various recruits. The looks of concern, shock, and some with looks of downright horror at the mention of the Imperial Naval Vessel were very enjoyable to the assorted Humans as they walked out of the meeting room. When the door finally slammed shut, and all the Humans left, the CO spoke.

“Get every last fucking recruit from cadres one through ten in the assembly room in ten fucking minutes!” She ordered. “I have had enough of the Commanding General on my ass because of this. I’ll be damned if this training facility becomes just like that fucking ship did, am I understood!”

“Yes Ma’am!” The various DI’s echoed, and began moving about, returning to their training cadres.

“This is becoming a Goddess damned nightmare!” Another officer said, her irritation palpable. “How the fuck did the Human even know that?” She hissed.

“They aren’t stupid,” Major Mal’Ava said. “Besides, it's not exactly a secret what happened on that ship, or the mark it left on the Imperial Military.”

“Isn’t he your little boy toy from Earth?” Another Officer asked. Mal’Ava just glared at the woman in response, and the officer, a Captain, practically shrunk under her gaze.

“He’s my boyfriend, I didn’t have him placed here because he looks good either. Besides, he wasn’t lying about that last part either. I was there on the battlefield when we captured him. He has killed before, and I doubt he’d hesitate to do it again. Besides, his past skillset is something we really need in the Marines.”

“ARI’s,” Staff Sergeant Kolani said. “While their strength is at the bare minimum, nearly every Human here has exceeded the stamina requirements for that speciality.”

“That’s what I keep hearing about these Humans.” The CO said, as she walked over to them. “Barely any strength, but can run for days at a time. Just a shame they have all that hair covering them, otherwise I might try one.”

“Don’t be a prude, Ov’Ari,” Mal’Ava said. “That hair can make things fun. But I am being serious here. The 6th Expeditionary Fleet is hurting for Reconnaissance Infantry, and if these Humans get sent to that training, and pass it, it’ll line up with our pickup of new Marines, including them.”

“If they make it.” Ov’Ari said.

“I believe they will make it. From what I read of his file, and the files we have on the others, it’d be a waste of talent sending them elsewhere.”

“Whatever you say, Major. I’ve got to go deal with this new headache, and I imagine that by the time we’re done dealing with the recruits, none of us will want to talk for a few days.” With that, she walked out of the room, heading to the assembly room, ready to, with the Drill Instructors, explain the situation to them, and how it affects them moving forward.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“IS THIS HOW MOST OF YOU CUNTS WERE RAISED!” The CO shouted at the assembled recruits in the assembly room. “IS THIS HOW YOU WERE TOLD TO TREAT MALES!” She screamed again, playing the recording of the incident at the bar. How Recruit Tal’nak continuously pestered Recruit Pierre until she refused to take no for an answer, grabbed him and dragged him out of his chair, which sent him tumbling to the floor. How Recruit Trissila’s only response to the incident was worrying about a fight starting.

How Recruit Pierre pulled a can of Grinshaw spray from his pocket, and shot it in her face, and Recruit White charged her, and knocked her out. The rest of the recording showed other recruits getting up, seemingly ready to defend their fellow recruit who was knocked out, until the remaining Humans stood up, and got ready for a fight.

The recruits who were in the recording, and had done nothing to help, but instead seemed to be on Tal’nak’s side, were front and center in the assembly, and had gathered scorn from DI, Officer, and Recruit alike. All but Recruit Revani, who submitted the footage, and was elsewhere in the assembly room. But all of those that were in the bar at the time of the incident, were directly up front.

“Recruit Trissila, were you not concerned that the safety of a fellow recruit was threatened? Were you only concerned about a fight breaking out, instead of the fact that one of your fellow recruits was in danger of being raped?” Said SDI Prisma.

“The other Human recruits could have handled it, Drill Instructor.” She said, head hanging downward.

“And if they weren’t there? Would you have still done nothing?” She accused. “Or the rest of you, who stood up, only as Recruit Tal’nak was hit with Grinshaw spray? By all accounts, it seemed obvious you weren’t there to assist Recruit Pierre, but ready to assist against him, and those who were there to help him.”

“But it's Turox shit, these Humans flaunt themselves and expect us not to-” Before Halani could continue, the roar of her own SDI shut her up.

“SHUT YOUR DAMN MOUTH, RECRUIT!” SDI Pasani screamed. “THEY ARE YOUR FELLOW BROTHERS IN ARMS, AND YOU FAILED YOUR DUTY TO PROTECT THEM!” The fury burning in the woman’s eyes was a sight to behold. When you dealt with regular Drill Instructors, you knew what they were capable of. With the Seniors, they were the parental figures, who took care of the recruits. When they got angry, and raised their voices, you knew it was bad.

“YOU FAILED YOUR PRIMARY DUTY AND WERE COMPLICIT IN AN ATTEMPTED RAPE OF A FELLOW RECRUIT!” The CO barked, a look of pure disdain and disgust on her face as she regarded the recruit in question. But when she spoke, her tone was lower, but undoubtedly more dangerous. “I do not care if they refused your badgering for sex. I do not care if they walked around shirtless. I do not *not give a fuck if they took anyone else to bed.* You, and by extension all the recruits in this incident, have proven themselves unworthy of serving in The Empress’s Military due to your inaction. You will be separated and sent back to whatever backwater world you came from.”

From here on, Recruits Halani, Kakiska, and the others who attempted to fight the Humans in the bar, were separated from military service, with Recruit Tal’nak facing prison time, followed by blacklisting upon release.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The forest was silent as Zachary scanned the treeline with his rifle. Off to his left, he saw Novikov, alongside Recruit Revani, advancing forward towards the enemy squad. It was cadres 1-5 versus 6-10. Cadres with Humans versus cadres without. It was veterans vs recruits. And they were enjoying every minute of the exercise. While there were only 15 Humans total in the training exercise, among the 5 cadres, 11 of them had prior military experience, nearly all in combat arms. They all had experience fighting the Shil’vati, and knew how they operated. Staying pinned down wasn’t an option, as it opened them up to orbital bombardment, something Zachary knew all too well. 

Both sides in this simulated exercise would switch orbital control every so often, meaning whoever got pinned down, and didn’t have orbitals, was fucked. But for those who knew this song and dance, and had lived it years ago, they didn’t need bombardment. Conventional warfare, fighting your enemy face to face? That was where the Humans excelled, and it was showing.

“Red Leader, this is Red-Pod-One, eyes on five, I say again, five enemy contacts moving up F-Eleven Pathway, how copy, over!” Came the voice of William White. Now, they all knew that wasn’t the verbatim line they were taught, and knew the DI’s were hearing them, but frankly, they didn’t care. They were acutely aware of how many of them were former military, or had expected them to be. Their ability to punish them was limited, and it infuriated the DI’s. But based on their performance thus far, they were likely not to care.

“Red-Pod-One, remain in concealment. Once the Enemy enters Zone Green, engage!” Zachary replied, looking through his carbine’s sight, assisted by his built in HUD, tracking the enemy Pod coming in. He was back in his element. Sure, he wasn’t a badass Special Forces operator like quite a few of his fellow Humans were, but he did graduate from Scout Sniper School. Granted, he was in for less than a month before the Invasion occurred, but he didn’t forget his training. But here, he didn’t need to use a lot of it. “Targets 200 meters and closing. Prepare to engage, Red-Pod-One!”

“Affirmative, starting the timer, break!” White responded.

“Do you have to do this, Human?” Came the cry of a recruit of a Pod he, Novikov, and Revani wiped out. Well, more like he and Novikov did the work, while Revani stared in shock as they basically wiped out a whole Pod of 5 recruits in only a few seconds. To make things worse, he decided to prop himself up on one of their bodies, enjoying the feeling of the soft body beneath.

“The dead don’t talk, now shut up!” He responded, a grunt of indignation coming from the Helkam woman beneath him, and a smirk growing across his face. “This is my world!” He chuckled darkly to himself. His target was dangerously close. ‘Dangerously close for them’, he thought darkly as he pulled the trigger, and watched the head of the Pod go down, followed by two more as White and Novikov simultaneously opened fire. The remaining two attempted to scatter, and find cover, but fell to another shot from the Marine and Australian Commando.

They scanned ahead, seeing the coast was clear, and advanced forward. Cadres 6-10 currently had orbital supremacy, but as it stood, 1-5 were winning. Assorted screams of terror and surprise echoed throughout the woods, off in the direction of where the Gurkha and Kenyan were. They reveled in this shit, and it was showing. Zachary looked around, and saw that all of his Podmates were present. Him, White, Revani, Kadra, Novikov, Trissila, someone who he wished had gone down much earlier, and a few other Shil’vati he didn’t care to know the names of.

“Orbital control is on our side again!” Revani relayed, only for Zachary to wave her off.

“Fuck that shit, we don’t need it, kid. Watch and learn how professionals handle this.” He replied, moving up, and scanning the forest and his HUD simultaneously. He watched and listened, waiting for something to appear out of the norm. He threw his fist up, bringing his pod to a halt, and getting down on one knee. His HUD marked two targets running parallel to his front. The Pods, which he broke into Wedge formation, waited as he did. He gave the appropriate signals, and White and Novikov broke off with their Pods, scattering themselves, as to not make an easy target.

“He’s still chasing me!” He heard a cry from the lead figure on his HUD. He sighted in, and focused on whoever it was. Too short for a Shil’vati, which probably meant she was a Helkam. Before he got a chance to fire, she fell down, her leg seemingly locking up, and her pursuer only got closer and closer, until he entered line of sight, and pounced on her.

“AYO GORKHALI!” He screamed to the sky, before mocking a stab into her heart, blasting her in the chest, and running off in the direction he was headed, right as four more contacts appeared on the HUD.

“Red-Pod-One, this is Red Leader, Four more contacts on approach from S-7 Pathway, 150 meters and closing, break.”

“Affirmative Red Leader, eyes on contacts.” White responded, sighting in on the enemy Pod coming their way. Once they crossed the threshold, the order was given.

“Light em up!” Zachary said, pulling the trigger, and lead contact crumpled to the ground, suit locking up in an awkward position, with the wearer slumped over a log. White, Novikov, and Revani fired, and the remaining three went down a few seconds later. Once more, they moved up on the enemy positions, taking note of the Pod they took down, their markings indicating them from Cadre 7. “Good work, move up!”

“Roger!” White said. As they continued to move up, they saw more and more evidence of just how badly the Shil’vati recruits were outmatched in this exercise. Along the patrol route they were taking, it seemed more and more as if the opposing cadres were in disarray, and scrambling around like madmen to figure out what to do. Orbital supremacy was still with 1-5, so that wasn’t a worry. However none of them had seen fit to use it yet. But as they continued through the forest, it seemed as if some of their opponents had their heads on straight.

“Halt!” Zachary ordered, his eyes scanning the trees ahead of him. He saw something quick dart between the trees. Whatever it was, it was certainly fast. He signaled to White and Novikov, pointing to where he last saw the blur. They gave the appropriate signals to their Pods, and began taking up defensive formation. Then he saw it again, this time off to his left. It was quick too. “WHITE, WATCH OUT!” He screamed to the Australian, who dove for cover just in time as a simulated laser cracked over him, scorching the tree he was near.

“Fucking scatter now!” White told his Pod, who began spreading out, finding cover, and scanning their sectors. The blur came again, this time dropping right in front of them. A large, hairy creature stood before them. A Rakiri. She was fast, they couldn’t deny that, and landed right in front of them. Her heightened reflexes and quietness on her feet gave her an advantage, but they had some of their own. They weren’t High Speed motherfuckers back home for nothing, and this Rakiri did seem extremely pissed. Claws extended, she tried swiping at White, who narrowly dodged the hit.

“Light that overgrown fur ball up!” Zachary ordered in the comms, as Novikov’s Pod came into view, and with the firepower of everyone else, proceeded to light the Rakiri up. Strike after strike from their simulated rounds locked every portion of the armor, and sent the hairy beast down. Rakiri were potent hunters, no doubt about it, and held a lot of advantages over a Human. But they weren’t going to give up, and she made the mistake of not counting all of the Humans before striking.

More contacts popped up on the HUD, and more simulated rounds came their way. It was a trap, meant to bait the Pods' focus onto the Rakiri, and which Zachary, White, and Novikov soon realized, as they began sending their Pods to different positions. Then in their helmets, a familiar sound dinged in their ears.

“Orbital control is lost!” Zachary said, aiming down his carbine at one of the contacts ahead, letting go a shot that got the bitch directly in the head, sending her down. But they weren’t coming out unscathed. Trissila went down with a hit to the chest, while Kadra took one to his right arm, sending him down behind a tree, unable to continue fighting. But against the experience that Zachary, White, and Novikov had, and the fact they knew full well that they were racing against the clock, they pushed forward.

They advanced, one half of their Pod’s providing cover, while Zachary flopped on his stomach and began low crawling as fast as possible, using logs and fallen trees to keep himself protected, as he creeped up closer to their lines, while his teammates pushed up further.

“We got them pinned down, whatever your gonna do, do it fucking quick, because I guarantee they’ll try raining death from above on us!” White said over the comms. Zachary knew he had to act quickly. They were pouring suppressive fire onto the enemy, but they could give a firing solution to the simulated forces in orbit, and he’d be damned that after all he’s been through, a fucking training exericse against recruits, is where he fails.

He was getting closer and closer. Close enough that he could hear those survivors talking frantically, and trying to bring in orbital support.

“Fuck no!” he exclaimed, jumping to his feet, and sprinting forward, jumping over obstacles, until he finally leaped over, and rolled behind the trees that the remaining OPFOR was using. They looked up, surprise and shock written across their faces underneath their helmets, as they desperately scrambled to take aim at him. Shil’vati reflexes, though, weren’t up to the task. Too little too late. He aimed, firing, first in the arm, second in the chest, third to the head. The first tried using her good arm to grab the rifle, only for Zachary to step on her wrist, and use his foot to flip her on her back. Taking his helmet off, he knelt down, and looked her dead in the face, a wicked smile across his face as he spoke. “Welcome to the jungle, bitch!

Part II - My altercation with a HUMAN

ITERATION A22

I received notice from the council, they were not happy with my report and requested that I go under-cover to learn more about this species. They wanted a complete analysis. There was a certain risk to my not satisfying the council. I had been afforded a certain level of autonomy in order to fulfil my purpose. I could not appear to be compromised, my existence would be reduced.

We set out in closer orbit of the species home world. I punched in a target location, a large continent  spanning from one pole to another. A hotspot on our scans detected a large amount of technological development in a region not far from the top pole. According to our assessments this area was called by the natives the “United States of America”.

We soon landed in an area of heavy green fauna. I activated a cloaking device that altered the mind of nearby sapient species, the Humans perceived me as their own. After a while I had discovered a type of land-based transport infrastructure, metal boxes containing Humans, vaulting away at a discerning speed, especially considering the fragility of their bodies. I was constantly reminded of examples like this, where Humans retained a redundant technology, for no apparent reason.

Near by I could observe a sort of social paradigm, Humans gathered around a type of commune. Interestingly they not only required liquid for sustenance, but a type of solid organic matter too. They took pleasure in perceiving vibrations whilst performing a type of ritual, shaking their extremities in an incongruent and disorderly fashion. There appeared to be order to the vibrations being produced, different frequencies invoked different reactions, rituals often containing several layers of vibrational patterns in a predictable manner.

During this analysis I had somehow drawn the attention of one of the creatures. It was at this point I realised this species relies on a primitive form of communication, these vibrations I witnessed were some kind of expression designed to stimulate this sense. Computer analysis revealed the vibrational patterns correlated to the form of written language we had witnessed on their information hive. Once I knew this, it was easy enough for me to develop a device that could replicate these vibrational patterns and allow me to interpret them in return.  

My first transaction with a Human was one of awkwardness and surprise. They appeared to be uncomfortable with my presence. The transaction log is as follows, in Human written form:

**Human**

	Hey! What are you staring at?

**NT101**

	Greetings. I am observing your behaviour.

**Human**

	What…? Are you some kind of freak?!

**NT101**

	I do not understand this categorisation.

**Human**

	If you don’t get out of my face you’ll regret it buddy!

**NT101**

	I’m unable to comprehend your intention. I am not physically located within your face. I 	am able 		to infer that you wish to impose a physical force on me for this transgression. I 	would advise against 	this.

**Human**

	Are you some kind of wacko from outer space or what? You’ve got an ass-whoopin’ 	coming your way.

In this moment the Human became aggressively violent. It closed its hand to produce a blunt weapon and attacked me with a surprising amount of force. It was smaller than me yet caused physical damage impulses within my own body. The Human deceptively was a lot more capable in unarmed combat than I had initially suspected.  

In response to this attack I had decided to act with equal force. I replicated the Human’s closed fist and launched it. My attack failed, the Human not only demonstrated substantial strength, it dodged me with ease. This conflict has lead me to the conclusion that we as a species are physically inferior to the Humans, partially due to the increased gravity on their world, but also due to the lack of competition in our own biosphere.  

After a few exchanges in this gravity and I was near exhaustion, the Human on the other hand; was raring to go, its intellect is only outmatched by its physical endurance. I would recommend we look at their genetic structure to investigate the possibility of adding adaptations to improve our own genetic code.",/r/HFY/comments/opjiea/prognosis_on_humanity_my_altercation_with_a_human/,11

After gently clearing the edge of the Ring, I headed out system to start the process of making sure I could actually fly this thing. The Pak had cleared out everything that could potentially be a threat to their new habitat, all the way to the Oort cloud. I was fairly confident that any comets that had the potential to end up in system had been some of the first things harvested for the atmosphere.

After ensuring that the gravity polarizers were online, with instructions to the flight computer to monitor everything carefully, I pushed the throttle forward slowly, bringing the reactionless thrusters up off idle. Not that they really ""idled"", but it was how I thought about things. I had a gauge displaying actual thrust as well as perceived thrust. At 1 G of acceleration, I was experiencing just a hundredth of that. So I cranked things up a bit, and went to 10 Gs of thrust. Everything stayed perfectly stable. I gradually increased things, until I was accelerating at 500 Gs, and feeling 5 of it. Which was surprisingly easy to take. Good to know.

After fifteen minutes of that, I was hurtling through the system at nearly sixteen million kilometers per hour. At which pace it would *still* take me 40 hours to reach the equivalent of the orbit of Jupiter. Man. Space really *is* just mind-bogglingly big.

Well this is fun and all, but I've got places to be. I rotated the ship and engaged the hyperdrive.

Holy fucking fuckballs. I'm pretty sure that the stars just went plaid. The documentation had been clear enough, but 2.1 megalights was *really* fast. The course I had plotted took me up above the galactic disk, over, and back down. It would be about ten days to actually get back.

Should be plenty of time to write some useful software.

I came out of hyperspace around the orbital distance of Eris, but at 30 degrees above the ecliptic. I let the 'scope take in a view of the system, then made a fast hop inward to the Belt. I accelerated at a mild 100 G to match orbital velocity with Ceres. I expected to be spending a lot of time here in the near future. Just for the fuck of it, I suited up and EVA'd over and planted an AnCap flag on it. ""I claim 'dis rock fa' da Beltahz!""

Yeah, ok, I'm a dork. I can live with that.

After I was back inside, I started making my way home. I made sure the fields were configured to keep me out of sight. No need to cause a panic.

I was parked at L5 when I patched myself into the phone network and made my first call back in the Sol system.

""Hey Charm, how are things?""

""Fess, what the fuck! BfV have been sniffing around all over the place since I got that letter and the email to the drop address.""

""They get anything?""

""Your little girlfriend about three weeks ago, but nothing else.""

""Damnit. I *told* her to go subtle, but she just wouldn't listen. They never listen. Why do they never listen?""

""Maybe you shouldn't get involved with teenagers if you want good decision making.""

""No one who makes good decisions would get involved with me in the first place. My personal life aside, you say that the BfV picked her up?""

""Yeah. A subgroup that goes by… I can't believe I'm saying this… DERP. I'd have just ignored the whole thing, except you had *signed* those pictures. So, either you got access to a Hollywood class server farm for some kind of hoax, or someone grabbed your key, or… I don't even know what to think.""

""Not a hoax, buddy. You notice the delay on this call?""

""Yeah. I figured you must be in some deep shit and routing funny.""

""That's definitely the obvious and logical conclusion. But no, the real reason is because I'm currently sitting in a spaceship at a height of 250 kilomiles. Tell me about Anneke.""

""Fess, I know you're a lot bigger than me, but I'm going to kick your ass if you don't start making sense.""

""Where'd they take the **girl**, Charm?""

""Kasernengel.""

""Fine. Tell one of our friends near Alt-Treptow to aim a camera that way. You're going to want to watch this. But tell everyone to stay inside. I expect this to cause a significant disturbance. I find myself suddenly very angry.""

""Wait, you're actually in Berlin?""

""Not yet. Watch the skies.""


---


I shifted into an orbit trailing the ISS by 5 degrees. Drones kicked off at regular intervals to give me a coverage network. Three hours later, I had a whole lattice network up here, and had penetrated all the networks I needed access to.

Time to make some more phone calls.


---


""Gruß Gott, Herr Sterkür.""

""Who is this? How did you get this number?""

""My name is Hephaestus. I got your number by looking it up in your company directory. You **have** something of mine.""

""Company directory? I work for the BfV! The only directory is in our internal network!""

""Yes. Yes it is.""

""I don't know what exactly is going on yet, but now you're courting hacking charges. You have quite the talent for getting yourself in trouble.""

""I think I'm well beyond that at this point. You *really* should have listened to the warning I sent.""

""About how you'd 'kick our teeth in'? Indeed. How about you come in and we'll have a chat about it.""

""Count on it. I'll be there in about ten minutes.""

""You're in Berlin, then?""

""I'm about 900 miles, no, sorry, European, 1500 klicks away.""

""Yes, well, some countries have accepted the superiority of the metric system.""

""Yeah, yeah, I get it, there's two kinds of countries on Earth. Those that use the metric system... and those that have walked on the moon.""

He sighed.

""And how do you expect to be here in ten minutes then?""

""Easy peasy. I'm just going to go around all the traffic.""

""You're not making any sense.""

""Don't worry, you'll understand soon enough.""

I made another phone call. A conference call, if you will. It turns out that with sufficient computing power, it's actually pretty trivial to get the Chancellor of Germany, the Prime Minister of England, and the Presidents of Canada, China, France, India, Israel, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, and America all on the phone. And generate simultaneous translations. And yeah, I know the guy in charge of the Norks isn't called the ""president"" but I'm not calling him ""supreme leader"". Gimme a fuckin' break.

With the leaders of all of Earth's nuclear powers listening, I began. ""Good evening, afternoon, or morning as the case may be, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Amos MacArthur. More commonly known as Hephaestus. I'm an American citizen, born in Springfield, Missouri, on the 7th of December in 1976. You're all on mute, so don't bother responding.""

""I've recently had a rather interesting adventure that's placed me in control of some *extremely* advanced technology. Which is how I'm calling you from outer space. The German intelligence directorate has rather foolishly kidnapped someone extremely important to me.""
 
""For most of you, this is a simple courtesy call to avoid anything stupid occurring. For anyone who might have air assets in Germany, Madame Chancellor and Mister President, this is a **warning**. There are two ways this can go. I can come out of orbit and collect my girlfriend with minimal fuss, or I can come out of orbit, you can attack me, a whole bunch of military personnel will likely end up dead, and I'll collect her *anyway.* Or as we like to say back home, **'fuck around and find out'**.""

""When I said the tech I have is advanced, I really wasn't kidding. You could throw nukes at my spaceship and not even scratch the paint. So please, don't do anything retarded? Mister President, being functionally retarded, I suppose you have to be excused from that request. Try anyway.""

""Everyone, in a few short moments, you'll likely receive notification of an unexpected descent from orbit towards Berlin. Courtesy call ends now. Hephaestus out.""

[*Go tell that long tongue liar*](https://youtu.be/eJlN9jdQFSc)  
*Go and tell that midnight rider*  
*Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter*  
*Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down*  
*Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down*

I pushed a button, and fell *lots* faster than a mere **rock** towards my target. I accelerated at 50 G, nose down on a fastest path descent. Gods but I loved this ship. I didn't feel more than a spare half G. I bet the flame front looked *amazing* from the ground. I hoped no one crashed their car watching.

*You can run on for a long time*  
*Run on for a long time*  
*Run on for a long time*  
*Sooner or later God'll cut you down*  
*Sooner or later God'll cut you down*

Having checked the European ATC network beforehand, I had timed everything such that there was a ton of clearance around my path. Of course, that depended on them not scrambling military fighters. Then again, I wasn't giving them a whole lot of *time*, either. 900 miles in five minutes, dropping below the sound barrier high enough up to make sure I arrived with a boom, but not a glass shattering one, didn't leave a lot of room for interception.

*Well my goodness gracious let me tell you the news*  
*My head's been wet with the midnight dew*  
*I've been down on bended knee talkin' to the man from Galilee*  

I kicked out three dozen knife missiles as I went hell bent for leather straight at the ground. Six of them had predefined missions. Six were scheduled to stay by me after I got out. The other 24 were just going to loiter around and be available to be useful if needed.

*He spoke to me in the voice so sweet*  
*I thought I heard the shuffle of the angel's feet*  
*He called my name and my heart stood still*  
*When he said, ""John go do My will!""*

I used a software defined radio to make a call and try to limit the impact of my arrival.

""Berlin Tower, this is CMV *Heaven's Blade* at 500,000 feet. Please be advised that I am on approach to Alt-Treptow, descending at 10,000 miles per hour to flight level zero.""

""Please repeat, *Heaven's Blade*, I think your transmission was garbled.""

""No, it wasn't. Current altitude is now 450,000 feet. Current speed is 10,000 miles per hour.""

""Is this a **joke**, *Heaven's Blade?* There is no craft in the world that can do any of that.""

""My craft is not *from* this world. Just tell all the passenger flights to divert. You're going to want to get them out of the way of the fighter jets anyway.""

""I will do no such thing! Get off this channel or you will be arrested!""

""Berlin Tower, I **strongly** advise you to check your screen.""

""Gott im Himmel…""

I heard him start declaring an emergency exclusion zone around Berlin airspace and stopped actively listening to that channel.

*Well you may throw your rock and hide your hand*  
*Workin' in the dark against your fellow man*  
*But as sure as God made black and white*  
***What's done in the dark will be brought to the light***

I punched up the next track, routed to the external speakers, and prepared for an entrance to the world stage nobody was ever going to forget.

Another week of training done, another weekend for them to relax and unwind. This weekend, however, was going to be different. A number of the guys had already planned it in advance with their dates, and decided to go to a rather fancy restaurant in town. Many of the girls seemed disappointed with their choice, but none of them pushed the Humans about it. The words they’d been told by the CO and DI’s had stuck with them, and they weren’t willing to push their luck. Some girls decided to join the Humans, either out of being friendly, feelings of protectiveness, or thinking they might get lucky.

In the end, half the Humans had someone to take with them. Brian and Anisa, as well as Anatoly and Kaarine, the Finn, were going with each other. Alistair had some short-stack Shil’vati bartender named Shalani, who he had met the previous week. Fisher had Jacana, Mayer had the plant woman whose name most of them still couldn’t fucking pronounce, while Zachary had managed to get Jek’sa and D’taari to accompany him. He was also in the process of trying to get Kadra and Akari to come along, but that was proving to be difficult. 

He had a feeling he’d convince them in the end, though. When they checked into their hotel rooms they still had an hour to kill before they all met up at the restaurant, so most of them were getting ready in their rooms, showering, and dressing their best. Or for Zachary and two resident twinks that had accompanied him, picking up where they left off last time they had a room to themselves. 

The sounds of wet kisses, slurping, and sucking filled the room as Kadra went to work on Zachary’s cock, coiling his long tongue around his member as his head bobbed up and down as if to a drumbeat. While Zachary laid on his back, Akari crawled atop him, fingers running up and down his chest and his tongue fighting for dominance in Zachary’s mouth. Using his right hand, Zachary snaked it down past the Helkan’s waist, and found what he was looking for. Akari moaned into the kiss as Zachary’s warm, wet hand began stroking his shaft ever so slowly, edging the Helkam further and further.

Zachary placed his other hand on the lithe Shil’vati male’s ass. Kadra lay on the end of the bed, face down, ass up, moaning loudly as Zachary played with his malleable rear, sending pangs of pleasure up his spine as he did so. An occasional pop filled the room as Kadra removed his lips from Zachary’s cock and went down to his balls, using both hands to stroke the human's shaft.

Dragging his tongue from from the base all the way to the tip before locking his lips around it, he repeated the same action. Kadra was far too skilled to be an amateur, and it made Zachary wonder just how long he’d been practicing, and what he’d used as learning material. Every now and then, he’d switch positions so he could stare up at Zachary as he bobbed up and down. The Shil'vati's gleaming gold eyes locked with his own, deliberately slowing his pace and locking his tongue around his cock. As he slowly withdrew himself, he kept his tongue wrapped around Zachary’s throbbing erection, leaving it coiled like a python around it.

“You hike hat!” He said, his tongue still wrapped around his cock, squirming and wrapping itself around it as the cold air made it twitch. Zachary broke the kiss with Akari, making the Helkam pout, before responding.

“God, you are lucky you are so fucking cute!” He said with a smile before placing his hand on the back of Kadra’s head. “But I didn’t say stop! Now keep going!” He commanded gently, his cock twitching more as the Shil’vati male nodded submissively, bringing his head back down, and wrapping his lips around his cock once more. Not wanting to wait further, Akari aggressively grabbed at Zachary’s head, turned it, and slammed his lips onto his own. In response, Zachary wrapped one arm around his waist and pulled him right on top of him. “Getting a little impatient and jealous, I see!” he mock-scolded.

“I don’t like being ignored!” Akari said before bringing his lips back to Zachary’s, enjoying how the Human’s warm body was pressed against his own and letting out a small moan of pleasure at the sensation. The Helkam male hiked his legs up, bringing both of them astride Zachary’s abdomen while curling himself up as much as possible, allowing him to remain lip locked with the Human. In response, Zachary took both of his hands and cupped Akari’s ass, making him moan louder as he kneaded his soft ass cheeks.

“Your ass is unbelievably soft, Akari!” Zachary commented, getting a muffled, indignant response from Kadra, who looked up, cock still between his lips. Kadra tried his best to scowl, but couldn't with a dick in his mouth. It only made him look cuter. It also didn’t help that he didn’t stop bobbing his head, either. He smirked down at the Shil’vati, who proceeded to huff in jealous indignation, before going back to his previous duties. “Not saying your ass *isn’t* soft, but I need to conduct a more thorough inspection to make sure,” he said. He slid his middle and index fingers on his right hand into his mouth, a motion that confused Akari, until he felt them slide inside of him, while Zachary’s free hand gripped his head, and they once more were lip-locked with each other.

The insertion surprised Akari, but by the loud moan he gave off as Zachary’s fingers began probing his insides it was a very welcome intrusion. His moans became louder and more frequent as Zachary assaulted Akari’s prostate, fingering it with the skill he’d used before on previous partners, and certainly with more strength than had ever been applied to the Helkam. In the week since their first liberty, he’d gotten to know Kadra and Akari’s bodies really well. Shil’vati men had a slightly larger prostate, while Helkam had a smaller one. Both, however, were extremely sensitive, and a good fingering in the bathroom had made the both of them go crazy. A few minutes and they’d been cumming their brains out all over the floor, and left a pair of exhausted, panting messes.

That’s how you knew you did a good job. The previous week had also given the both of them a chance to test their gag reflexes and general skills at sucking dick, something Zachary had no issue helping them with. Most of the cadre girls didn’t like it, but he didn’t give a fuck what the girls thought. But before his thoughts could get any further off track, he felt his orgasm rising closer and closer to the top. He and Akari both. Kadra was stroking himself as he slashed and swirled his tongue across the head of Zachary’s cock, and one hand violently pumped up and down his shaft.

“Fuck, I’m gonna cum!” Zachary said, and not a moment too soon as he erupted inside of Kadra’s mouth, painting it with ropes of thick, warm cum. His cheeks bulged slightly as his mouth was running out of room, filled with both his cock, and the seemingly never ending torrent of cum that spat forth, threatening to leak from Kadra’s mouth if it didn’t stop.

“I-I can’t-” Was all Akari could say, before Zachary flipped him over, grabbing Akari’s cock, pushing it to his stomach, and started violently jerking it. From there, it didn’t take long for the Helkam to lose control, and shoot rope after rope of his own, rather cold cum, across his own stomach as Zachary held it there. He felt Akari’s cold member twitch nonstop as he shot his load all over his chest, nor did he miss how his head drooped to the side, and his eyes rolled upward.

Zachary fared little better as the orgasm that ripped through his body, sent pangs of pleasure all throughout him. His thigh and core muscles tensed up, and his fingers dug into the sheets as the purple skinned incubus was determined to drain the Human’s very life force from him. Thankfully, he and Akari’s orgasms subsided, much to Kadra’s relief, as his mouth was nearly full to bursting. As Kadra pulled off Zachary's cock, he had to keep his head tilted up, lest he spill some of the seed that filled his mouth.

“Hmmp hmmp!” Kadra mumbled out, his mouth still closed as he crawled up to Zachary, who was now sitting upright, looking at the Shil’vati twink with a smirk. He got on his knees, rock hard cock still twitching in the open air, and opened his mouth to Zachary. The sight of the thick, blue organ, surrounded by a sea of white, sticky cum, made Zachary’s cock twitch again. Placing his hand to his chin, and raising his head slightly more, he said one word.

“Swallow!” He commanded, and Kadra did. He brought his lips together, closed his eyes, and swallowed a few times. When he opened his mouth again, it was all gone. “Good boy!” Zachary said, bringing his lips to Kadras, holding him a hot and passionate kiss for a good ten seconds, before they broke apart, and focused their attention on Akari. The Helkam’s cum covered his stomach and chest; something Kadra went to remedy as he put his tongue to work on him.

“So warm!” Akari muttered out as Kadra ran his rough and sticky tongue across his toned stomach and chest, making sure not to miss a drop of the cold, sticky seed that was splattered across his body. When he was done, Kadra crawled to face level with him, and slammed his lips on Akari’s. The Helkam still laid there, partially limp from the afterglow, and did nothing as the Shil’vati ravaged his mouth with his tongue.

“God damn!” Zachary said as he watched Kadra’s tongue bulge out from Akari’s cheeks, truly showing no mercy to the Helkam’s mouth. Akari could do little more than let the Shil’vati’s tongue do as it wanted, painting his own mouth with the seed and saliva of two men, as his own tongue was wrestled into submission and his mouth fucked by the extremely horny Shil’vati male. The sight of Kadra dominating and mouth fucking Akari made him rise once more, something that Kadra didn’t immediately notice, as he’d still yet to see release, and was enjoying his dominance over Akari. “Ahem!” Zachary cleared his throat, getting the attention of Kadra, as well as Akari, who both looked over at him.

“Sorry,” Kadra purred. “I got a little carried away. How about we move on to what we discussed earlier?” He suggested. Zachary just grinned in response, and looked over at Akari, whose eyes went wide as he realized he was about to be on the receiving end of a horny Human male.

“Don’t worry, Akari,” Zachary said, lifting the male up to face level, and kissing him. “I’ll be gentle. Now, on your hands and knees, I’m going to show you what a real fuck is.” He said. The Helkam male wasted no time, although he did need some help, his legs slightly jellified due to his last orgasm. When he was in position, Kadra’s hot, throbbing member in front of his face, and Zachary gripped onto his hips for support, he knew what was going to happen.

Grabbing a bottle of lube he had bought from a store, he squeezed out a glob of it on his finger, and proceeded to rub it in, and around Akari’s entrance, slathering lube in, and around it, to ensure there was as little pain as possible for the both of them. Once finished, he poured a bigger glob on his hand, and slathered his cock with it, until every last inch was wet and slimy with lube. Kadra, however, didn't want to wait longer, and grabbed Akari’s face, and forced his cock between his lips.

“Empress, its so fucking cold!” He breathed out, slowly thrusting back and forth into the Helkam’s mouth. Now, it was Zachary’s turn, as he poked and prodded Akari’s ring with the tip of his cock, until it finally gave in with a pop, and Zachary was inside of him. The act however, made Akari audibly cry out, even with Kadra’s cock in his mouth.

“Hmmp!”

“Stop!” Zachary said, causing Kadra to pull back, and out of Akari, and for Zachary to check on the Helkam twink. “Did that hurt? Do you want me to stop?” He said with genuine worry. Fingers were one thing to practice with, it's a whole other thing when it comes to full blown anal sex. Even with plenty of lube, there will still be pain. And given that by all indications, Human men had a size advantage over their alien counterparts, even more caution had to be taken in this setting.

“Y-yes,” Akari stammered out, looking back at Zachary. “Please don’t stop, just be slow.” He asked. Zachary simply nodded, applying even more lubricant, before trying, and succeeding at penetrating the Helkam once more, taking it much slower, before finally bottoming out. As he did, he could feel the inner walls of Akari grip and massage him, as the tip of his cock slammed into his prostate. The act forced a guttural moan from the male, even as Kadra set about using his mouth and throat to his content.

“Holy fuck, are all Helkam this cold?” Zachary said in astonishment, marvelling at the temperature difference. “Fisher wasn’t fucking lying!”

“Hmmp, hmmp!” Akari moaned out as the two men set about spit roasting him.

“Yes, they all a-” Kadra couldn’t finish his sentence as Zachary leaned over, grabbed him, and dragged him closer, slamming his lips onto his, and forcing his tongue into the Shil’vati’s mouth. Soon, Kadra was reciprocating, and their organs battled each other for dominance in each other’s mouths. It was the one area where Zachary was at a disadvantage, as the long, rough tongue, wrestled his down, and began wriggling around, dominating his own mouth, and causing his cheeks to bulge out. Kadra began moaning louder and louder into the kiss, until he finally broke it. “I’m gonna fucking cum!” He cried out, thrusting his hips even faster, and slamming Akari’s head down on his cock, forcing him to take it right to the base.

He burst like a water fountain in Akari’s mouth, the Helkam male’s eyes rolling in the back of his head as the sensation of hot cum flooded his mouth and throat, while Zachary’s warm cock pounded him from the back. The heat difference from the two males drove the Helkam crazy, even more so when one was spurting rope after rope of cum down his throat. Akari raised a hand to tap on Kadra’s leg, but he refused to let go, his orgasm stil shooting through him, and causing him to keep shooting into Akari’s mouth. Just as Zachary was about to push Kadra off, and let him breath, the Shil’vati fell backward. A look of pure bliss written on his face as he sprawled out over the bed, his once hard member deflating, with a trail of cum still trailing from his head, to Akari’s lips.

“Empress,” Kadra said, his chest rising and falling, still trying to catch his breath. “That...was...amazing!”

“I-I coul-couldn’t bre-breathe!” Akari said between gasps as Zachary continued to slam into him.

“You enjoyed it, didn’t you?” Kadra said, with an impish grin on his face.

“Not the poi-eep” His words were cut off by Zachary pulling his legs out from under him, and sending him on his stomach. Before he could respond, Zachary pressed his full weight, and body heat, onto Akari, and slammed his lips onto his. The heat of Zachary’s body, fully pressed onto Akari’s, his warm cock slamming into his prostate, and tongue ravaging Akari’s mouth, made the Helkam shiver with delight. Zachary slipped his hand underneath the twink, grabbing ahold of his cock, and stroking up and down as best he could given the position.

“Holy shit!” Zachary grunted as he continued to pound into the Helkam twink, marveling at how cold he was on the inside, and loving every moment of it. His walls gripped and tightened around the invading member, not wanting to let go. His clawed hands tore into the sheets, while his tongue went limp, as did much of his body, as he allowed the Human to do as he willed. What didn’t stop, however, were the whorish moans escaping his lips as Zachary drove Akari higher and higher. The feeling only intensified as Zachary broke off from the kiss, leaving a streak of warm kisses across his neck leading up to his ear, and began nibbling lightly on it.

“So warm!” Akari moaned out, his body shivering in pure, uncontrolled bliss, as the Human played him like an instrument, knowing where and how to make him moan louder, and squirm in response to his touch. Around the wider galaxy, a male that could go more than once in a sitting was unheard of. That is, until Humans entered the galactic spotlight. Akari, however, felt like he was about to achieve the impossible.

“You like it, huh?” Zachary grinned moving over to Akari’s other ear, latching his lips to it, and sucking hard on it. Akari’s insides clamped down hard in response. Zachary’s grin only grew wider at the affirmation.

“Ye-ee-ss!” He gasped out, air being driven from his lungs with each thrust from the dominant Human atop him. Zachary’s touch was almost magical to Akari, bringing him to levels of pleasure he’d never experienced with any woman. Not to mention that no woman had ever gotten close to bringing him to a second orgasm so soon after his first. The euphoric feeling shooting through his body only intensified as Zachary pushed his body hard into Akari’s, and chose to grind himself atop Akari, instead of lifting himself off, and plunging back down.

“Then you’ll love this!” Zachary said, wrapping both of his arms tightly around the Helkam twink, pulling him in as close as he could, smothering Akari in his body heat, and continuously grinding the head of his cock into him, mercilessly battering the poor males prostate. Their lips locked once more, Zachary’s tongue probing and coating Akari’s mouth with his own warm saliva, making him shiver even more. The sheer heat of the embrace, and the gridining of the Human’s cock inside of him, was providing too much for the Helkam. He could hold back no longer. His cock, sandwiched between his legs, crying for release, finally let loose.

“I-I can’t...I’m cumming again!” Akari cried out, breaking the kiss, and burying his face into a nearby pillow. For the second time this night, the Helkam male erupted. His member twitched and shot rope after rope of cum across the bed sheets, as pangs of pleasure spread through every part of his body. As he came, Zachary did as well, the clenching of his walls against his member finally wringing his orgasm out from him. 

Akari could do nothing more but lay there, in mind shattering bliss, as the Human’s extremely hot cum slammed into his prostate, covering it, and painting his inner walls. The lava-hot sensation only made Akari’s body shake even more, and his cock twitched harder and faster, as the Human continued to force an orgasm from his body. Every nerve in his body screamed in pleasure, as his walls gripped and milked Zachary’s cock, forcing it to spew even more ropes of hot ejaculate inside of him. Akari mewled piteously into the pillow, while his cock continued to send more and more cum onto the sheets below.

Combined with the head of Zachary’s cock grinding into him, it was an experience Akari had never felt before. No one had ever made him experience such pleasure before, and he didn’t want this feeling to end. But, before he could black out from the full body orgasm that enveloped him, he felt Zachary lift off, and pull out of him. Akari lay there, his body limp, and a river of hot cum leaking from his entrance. Meanwhile, Zachary rolled off, propped himself up on one arm, and began admiring how he brought the Helkam to ruin.

“So, how did that feel?” He asked, a small smile tugging at his lips as he looked up and down Akari’s body, and brought his hand down to his ass, and gave it a light squeeze. His eyes also ran over Akari’s rapidly deflating, and slightly pained cock. A large puddle of cum, lay between his legs, where his cock was sandwiched after being pounded into by the Human. It took Akari a minute to respond, trying to get his thoughts in order, something Zachary no doubt had noticed, and his smug grin grew even wider.

“I’ve never...felt anything like that before!” Akari said, breathlessly. Akari couldn't deny that the Human was undeniably skilled in his craft, and judging by the look on his face, was enjoying the stroking of his ego. He tried to find the words to describe what Zachary had just done, but none seemed fitting. “How are you so good?” Was all he could say, unable to shift his body to properly look at him, or preserve his dignity, as he lay there, his legs not responding to his brain, and leaking the Human’s seed like a river.

“I guess it takes a real man to make you cum twice.” He chuckled, bringing a hand to Akari’s chin, raising his head up slightly, before plating a soft, passionate kiss on them. A kiss they held until both of their lungs cried for air. A kiss that Akari didn’t want to end. “Kinda funny. Us Humans have made men around the galaxy seem inadequate in the bedroom, now it looks like we can do that to women as well. All those years of evolution, and it takes a real man, a Human man, to fuck a second orgasm out of you.""

Akari wanted to protest, he really did, but he couldn’t deny it. Two orgasms in such a short time is unheard of for a male who isn’t Human, and yet this Human did just that to him. He may have been cocky, just as he was on the training field, but he had the skills to back it up. In the end, Akari didn’t argue with Zachary, there was no point to it. That, and his focus was taken up by the fact that Zachary’s cock rose once more, getting a slightly horrified eep from the Helkam.

“How?” He muttered out, staring at horror at what could potentially turn into round three. A round that would kill him if Zachary felt like trying to completely sate his libido here and now. Zachary just chuckled and looked down at his erection.

“Yeah, I guess round three is off the table, huh?” Zachary looked over at Kadra, who fell asleep, and back to Akari who was now staring up at him. “Well, I imagine another round will probably kill you, Kadra is asleep, and I’m not a rapist.” He got up, stretched, and made his way to the bathroom. “Oh well, I’ll be having plenty more fun tonight.” He said, turning on the shower head, and stepping in, not caring to close the door. 

Within minutes, Akari soon joined Kadra in slumber, and Zachary walked out of the hotel room, ready to meet his dates at the restaurant. What Zachary had failed to notice as he left the room, was the hidden camera that Kadra had set up, to record Zachary’s performance. A performance some people would soon learn about.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The restaurant they chose to attend had a bar in it as well. This was a good thing for the Humans who didn’t have dates of their own, but still wanted to look out for the others or just get drunk. From their own cadres, the twins, Dexta and Dax’Ala, Revani, and Vra’Lana, sat with them. There were some others who sat with them and shot the shit. A few Shil’vati, a Helkam, and even a Rakiri joined the procession, mainly girls from 6-10, ironically enough. After spending a week thrashing them on the training field, one might think they harbored resentment. If they did, they didn’t show it. They seemed genuinely curious about how they were so good on the field, and actually struck up conversations that weren’t filled with sexual advances.

For those who had dates, the night was going almost perfectly. Little arguments broke out between Fisher, Mayer, Jones, and White’s dates over who was paying the bill, and they, like their dates, weren’t budging. White’s date was last minute, a friend of Shalani who bragged about her situation to a friend of equally short stature, as well as being a bit on the heftier side. Since Shalani overheard the Humans saying they preferred shorter women, she decided to bring her friend on the date as well. Now, since White wasn’t enough of an asshole to say no to the woman who caught shit not only for her stature, but for her weight as well, he said yes. She was absolutely overjoyed at the prospect of getting a date, much to the dismay of other, taller, and skinner Shil’vati present.

In the end, it mattered not one bit. They were here to enjoy their night, and the company of their dates. For Zachary, he noticed that his dates were dressed immaculately. Their dresses, which resembled a Kimono back on Earth, were even more stylish- and probably much more expensive- than what they were wearing when he had met them. Both looked exceptionally beautiful, and had obviously taken the time to make themselves look and smell great. Zachary kinda felt like a bum, considering the fanciest clothes he had didn’t compare to what they wore.

“Good afternoon, ladies, glad to see you made it,” he greeted, eyes running up and down their bodies, something they noticed, and flushed red in response. “Sorry if I don’t seem dressed for the occasion, but if I knew you were going to be wearing such fancy outfits, I would have tried buying some new ones.” Again, they flushed darker red at the compliment.

“We’re glad you like it!” D’taari said.

“It’s not often we get to dress up for a date,” Jek’sa started. “It's been too long since I’ve gotten a chance to wear this. Even longer since I’ve worn it with someone who took interest in me.” She smiled at Zachary, although her eyes gave a gateway to her past, all the times she’d likely been rejected. Now she was with someone who didn’t care about who she used to be, and that made her truly happy.

“Well as I’ve said,” Zachary murmured, leaning forward, gently grabbing her chin, and planting a kiss on her lips. A kiss that went on longer than he thought it would, as she snaked her tongue into his mouth and wrestled with his own. That is, until D’taari got jealous, yanked her back, and thrust her own lips upon the Human, holding nothing back in her own kiss.

“Don’t tell me you're about to have a threesome here in the restaurant, now!” Came the voice of William White, who was laughing as he looked over from his table. Slightly embarrassed, D’taari broke the kiss, glaring at the Aussie, who only laughed harder.

“Fuck yourself, White!” Zachary said, not looking over, but flipping the Australian off. This only prompted the man to laugh louder, before turning to the girl in front of him. Likewise, Zachary did the same to the two beautiful Nighkru women that comprised his dates for tonight. As he wiped his lips with a napkin, he noticed two distinct colors of lipstick. A rather bright, lime green for Jek’sa, and a bright blue for D’taari. He raised his eyebrow at them before speaking. “New shade of lipstick, I see. I think it looks great on you both.”

“Glad you like it!” D’taari purred.

“Hopefully, we can leave it somewhere besides your lips, tonight!” Jek’sa said, not trying to hide her lewd intentions for the evening. Zachary simply smirked in response.

“Well then, how about we enjoy ourselves here first. I’ll need plenty to eat and drink, so I can have plenty of energy, *all night long!*” He emphasized those last words, making them, as well as the waitress standing right behind him, blush hard.

“Uh-may I, uh, take your order please?” She squealed out, trying, and failing not to turn completely blue. The Shil was average height, although on the plumper side of things. Not that he minded one bit, would still be fun. The woman blushed harder as she noticed him looking her over.

“I’ll take the turox steak, with the standard sides.” Zachary said, completely serious, and turning back to the two beauties across from him, and listened as they made their orders. Along with their dinners for the evening, they ordered a bottle of wine. Alien wine, as whatever it was glowed a greenish blue, which made Zachary raise an eyebrow in suspicion. “You don’t have to get me drunk to take me to bed, you know? It's not like you're repulsive to the point where I’d need to be wasted to enjoy it. You're not a Triki or Rakiri!” He said, smiling at the two ladies across from him, unaware and not caring that his comments were heard by the Rakiri who had joined them, as well as one of the moth women who served as a waitress at the restaurant.

“Repulsive?” The Triki said, frowning as best as she could, as she looked herself up and down. She was also the waitress who was carrying the plates to their table. The woman simply walked up to the table, set down their meals, and walked away, without saying a word. Zachary did take notice, but didn’t say anything. His dates however, gave him a disapproving look.

“Was that necessary?” Jek’sa asked.

“Yes, while I’m not saying you're entirely wrong, did you have to be so...blunt in your words? Or as loud?” D’taari asked. Zachary just shrugged.

“Hey, I’m brutally honest and I’m a Marine. And I didn’t join the latter because I’m a nice motherfucker either.” Zachary replied with a shrug. He glanced over the Rakiri in the bar, who was chatting with Recruits Victor and Johan, the latter was the resident Swede of cadre 5. The Rakiri in question was trying her luck with the both of them, hoping at least one would humor her, and come back to her hotel room. In the end, she finally relented, and walked away with a huff, and rejoining some of her friends at another table. “Enough of that, let’s enjoy our night here. And one final thing, I’ll be damned if I let a lady pay the bill for dinner. This is on me, whether you like it or not!” He smiled, before digging into his steak.

“But we-” Jek’sa was cut off by Zachary putting a hand up to shush her. He finished chewing, before responding.

“I dare not think of how my mother would feel if I let a woman pay for a date. I’d much rather be neutered than think of how she’d disown me."" 'Ignoring how she probably already disowned me for joining the people that killed her.’ He added that last bit in his head, and promptly shoved that though aside, not wanting to think about it. The two Nighkru pouted, but seemed to relent. Hell, it seemed he had it easier than the others did, as their dates refused to let them pay, while they refused to relent as well.

For the next half hour, everything seemed to be going well for all those involved. Spirits were high, everyone was getting along, laughing, and just generally having a good time. Then some Shil’vati in rather ornate skin tight jumpsuits walked into the restaurant. Many heads turned their direction as the group of Shil’vati walked in and began scanning the restaurant’s attendants. All of the Humans, and most of the other cadre members, scowled as they realized just who they were.

*Interior cadets!*

There were eight of them in total, all whose gazes went to the section the Humans were in, and turned their attention to. Without any hesitation, they stalked over to where the Humans were, drawing glares from every last one of them.  
“Fucking gestapo!” Zachary muttered, a cold glare fixated on the Interior cadet coming his way.

“Hey there, cutie, how are you doing tonight?” She asked, moving in uncomfortably close to him, and letting the zipper of her jumpsuit fall down, exposing her cleavage to him.

“Go away, I’ve already got a date tonight, and I’m not interested in going anywhere with you.” Zachary said, before picking up his second glass of wine, and taking another sip. ‘Just more fruity, alien bullshit. Maybe that’s why they tasted fruity when I went down on them.’ Zachary thought to himself, ignoring how the Interior cadet didn’t go away, but seemed to redouble her efforts. She motioned to one of her friends to walk over, and she did, turning sideways as she got to the table.

“Tits or ass, Human?” She said, pulling her zipper down further, barely hiding her massive cleavage hidden within. “I hear you Humans are a bit divided on that end, but no matter your preference, we can definitely help you.”

“Brains,” Zachary simply said, agitating the two cadets further. “Something the two ladies across from me have plenty of, not counting their natural beauty. Now go pester someone else.” The first one simply smiled in response.

“You know Human,” The first one said, her hand making contact with his shoulder, and her tongue uncoiling from her mouth, and running across his earlobe. “Women like us, are women of means. We can offer you far more than these cave scum. You come with us back to our hotel, and anything you want, we can get for you.”

“Neither your looks, nor your wealth, are of any interest to me,” Zachary growled, glancing at the fork and knife next to his right hand. “Now get you’re hands off of me, and fuck off to somewhere you're actually wanted!” Now, the cadet was pissed, and she was done taking no for an answer.

“Look here you little stiff-” her words were cut off by screams of pain from across the room. Siva had one of the Interior cadets on the ground, her arm twisted violently behind her back, and a  loud crack soon followed as he dislocated her shoulder. A swift hand chop to the carotid artery dazed the woman, leaving her half conscious on the ground. One of her friends rushed to help her, and Recruits Aiko and Nikau were right there, chairs in hand, slamming them into the cadet.

“I said,” Zachary growled, grabbing the nearby knife. “GET YOUR FUCKING HANDS OFF OF ME!” He screamed, throwing the woman’s hand from his shoulder, planting it on the table, and plunging the utensil through the woman’s hand, pinning it to the table and causing her to scream in pain. He followed it up by grabbing the wine bottle the two Nighkru had ordered and busting her friend right in the jaw, sending her tumbling to the floor amidst shards of broken glass and blood.

*“Get that bitch!”* D’taari said in her own language, prompting Jek’sa to move with her friend, going for another cadet approaching their table. In a stunning act of coordination, they took her down in unison, rendering her unconscious as they swept her legs out from underneath her, and delivered a harsh blow to her temple by Jek’sa’s fist, then a kick to her chin by D’taari.

“Hot damn!” Zachary said, marveling at how the two Nighkru women took down the Shil’vati with such speed and precision. His opponent however, was coming back for him. She ripped the knife from her hand, and had murderous intent in her eyes. She swung, a move he sidestepped rather easily before moving behind the woman and delivering a hard kick to the back of her knee, sending her down. This he followed up with a roundhouse kick to her jaw as she went down to her knees. He looked down at her, fury burning in his eyes as he watched her fall hard on her back, and he raised his foot above her jaw. “Goodnight, cunt!” He said, slamming it down on the woman’s jaw, knocking her out cold. As he looked around, he realized the other cadets had either been knocked out or rendered ineffective by the various cadre members in the bar. Some got outright jumped, as evidenced by the three Shil’vati, Helkam, and Rakiri who stood by Pierre and Johan, looking down on a bruised and bloodied cadet.

“Empress!” The Triki woman gasped out as she surveyed what had happened in the restaurant. Zachary looked over at her, walked to her, grabbed her omnipad, and swiped his chit across it, giving her a large enough tip that it made her eyes bulge out in surprise. Moseying his way to his table, he swiped it again, and paid for dinner. After doing so, he followed what every other recruit did after the cadets were dealt with: haul ass out of there.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It didn't help her. Not the therapy, not the meds, not even the procedures that were supposed to numb those memories. None of it helped her to forget all she saw, all that she did while stationed on Earth. The nightmares, the shakes, the screams she heard in her sleep taunted her endlessly. No matter how badly she tried, Rayna just couldn't forget it. 

She tossed and turned as the sounds of blaster fire, explosions, and screams drowned out everything else. How she was back on Earth during the invasion. How she and the others in her unit landed on a military base located on the lesser continental mass. How they effortlessly smashed all resistance, barely taking any losses in turn, and massacred the enemy. She remembered the first time she exited her Exo after the battle, and watched as infantry women gathered up the dead and dying Human soldiers. 

*All of them were men!* She watched in horror as countless men were laid next to each other, holes blown into them, limbs shot off, all with their eyes open, the life long since leaving them. How their lifeless eyes stared at her, their last moments filled with pain and suffering. The screams of those wounded with not long left in the world, or of those crying for their mothers, due to the wounds they sustained. 

She remembered how young most of them looked, barely adults, just out of primary school, ready to take on the world. So many different skin colors, shapes, and sizes among them. But the one thing they shared was the red blood that stained their uniforms and leaked from the wounds in their bodies. She remembered throwing up right then and there, as hundreds of bodies were laid out across a strip of empty land, with a seemingly never-ending amount still arriving. 

How she and her podmates said nothing the rest of that day. How so many girls broke down crying after seeing what they had done. Of how many men they had killed in such a short time. How they never stood a chance. How so many of her friends and fellow Marines filled the medical bay over the next few weeks. She tried so hard to justify what the Imperium had done. How they were bringing a primitive civilization, which had nearly destroyed itself repeatedly, into the gentle embrace of the Imperium. 

But what she had seen and done? There was nothing gentle about it. She tried her damndest to repress and forget it, even turning to recreational drugs to numb the memories. But they kept coming back. 

""Was it worth it?"" A million voices called out to her. She found herself surrounded by dead men. Dead Human men. All covered in the wounds they'd suffered on the battlefield, their eyes completely lifeless as they stared into her soul. ""Were our deaths worth it?"" They called out again. 

""It wasn't my fault!"" Rayna cried out, head turning, seeing nothing but dead soldiers all around her. 

""You murdered us!"" They cried back, this time, many of them were missing limbs, blood poured from wounds everywhere on their bodies, as they simply stared at her. Those damned, lifeless eyes stared into her very soul, making her blood run cold.

""I'M NOT A MURDERER!"" Rayna screamed at them, before everything around her faded, and she woke up in the Watch Office bed, covered in sweat. She got up, raced to the trash can, and threw up inside of it. She heaved and heaved, emptying the contents of her stomach, as well as some blood, into the can. Her whole body was shaking and she heard voices in her head. She ran to her drawer, pulling it open, grabbed the bottle of pills inside of it, tossed the cap off, threw a handful of them in her mouth, and downed the water bottle that was on the desk. She tossed the bottle in the can, and collapsed on the floor, huddling against the desk, and began crying.  

""I'm not a murderer!"" She sobbed out, the memories of everything she did refusing to stay dormant. ""I'm not a murderer!""",/r/HFY/comments/osauq5/semper_shilvati_an_ssbverse_story_chapter_22/,59
13,otpz6q,HFY,Thu Jul 29 06:56:57 2021,"Demon City, part 17","**C17:** **On Consideration, I Should Hold Planning and Social Events in Bathtubs**

Isaacs and SIA were kind enough to take me home in a tactical van, and a medical technician loaned me scrubs to wear back to my apartment. Isaacs was very happy after medical technicians waved devices over me and declared me healthy and sane, and the SIA troopers in the van with me warmed up a bit as I explained to the men just how difficult it is to find good heels that click dramatically on hard floors.

""That was... a day,"" I said to no one in particular after shutting the door to my apartment. Checking my phone, I estimated I had an hour until Richard, tonight's lucky catch, would arrive. Enough time to take a bath and freshen up. *And get my shit together.*  My broken shoes and the scrubs went to the garbage immediately, and the rest of my clothes went into the laundry.

I pulled a decent bottle of white wine and two glasses for the dining room table. *I don't really need much, he'll be tired from getting off his shift. Maybe we could watch a late night show, too.* I ran to the television to check what was on for the night, and found a few decent shows. The hard part was deciding what to wear so after a quick search of my closet, I decided a large shirt and black panties would do.

Then my phone buzzed. 

&lt;&lt;from Big Dork&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;Hey Lil', talked with your lawyer and have NO idea what's going on. They're certainly not putting you through a normal Signatory process, and this one seems like it's more high risk, high reward. There's a bunch of different Signatory classifications, and I've only focused on the Fae ones. I'll have some questions when I fly in. Then, we're going shopping, and you're not gonna weasel out of it. Love ya.&gt;&gt;

I read that over slowly twice so I wouldn't have a panic attack. *Maybe she's ok with me being an... 'Other' on the multiple choice list of species?  Should I test the water, or let it slide?That could be the subtext here. Why am I so bad at communicating when it's not for sex!?*  It took a while to respond to Anne.

&lt;&lt;from Lil' Dork&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;I know, right!? It totally went over my head and all the stuff you told me to keep my eyes out for didn't happen. Super weird. Kisses.&gt;&gt;

I put the Summoning book by the bathtub, and my phone to keep track of the time. Then I drew a bath and collapsed into it, finally alone with my thoughts. ""Could have gone with some candles,"" I mused aloud. I tried making a small, *actual* flame off my thumb like I saw Ilya doing earlier in the night. After about three flicks like it was a lighter, I got it working with only a minor pull of my magic, then snuffed it.

I let my claws, tail, and horns out and stretched my limbs. My tail snaked through the water underneath me. I conjured up a rubber ducky and squeaked it in my hand before sending it adrift in the tub. It had cute curly demon horns like mine. And a painted goatee on its bill. *I shall name you Bealzebubbles, First of her name.*

""Alright, stop stalling and start thinking!"" I kneaded my forehead to try and clear my thoughts. ""How do I even process today?"" I wet my hair and squirmed around, sloshing the water. *Can I go back to how things were?* 

I let a few tears drop into the water as I realized no, there was no way to turn back the clock. *Can I just walk away from- yeah, no, that won't happen.* 

*Isaacs and SIA will at least ask for my subject knowledge about cases, and at some point someone else in my life will connect the dots. I need to have SIA in my corner  I'm not careful like a secret agent. My life was already tenuous, frankly. I can't lie, and I've been deceiving my coworkers, family, friends, and one-night stands for years now. The only good thing about that bitch Isabel is that she's so nuts no one first thinks of me as a monster. Alice was scared out of her mind even though I was hers that night.*

*I may have internalized a lot of fear and mistrust, and... Ok, let's be fair- after meeting a few 'Dark' beings I wouldn't give fellow Sup's the benefit of the doubt either. And I wouldn't trust a mob of angry humans to not want me dead. SIA's here to operate as a bulwark against everyone freaking out and killing each other. I got lucky with Alice, but every person I tell is a life-or-death judgement for me. If I fuck up, I starve.*

I leaned my head back and stared at the tiles above me. ""It would be a cascade as rumors about my being a Succubus spread. SIA's out of my hands, but work and family... I don't.... want to- But I can magically bind people at my company not to tattle. SIA would be fine with it since they obviously want my status kept secret too."" I frowned. ""Should I magically bind- wait-a-minute, fucking *yes* I should do that. I've signed non-disclosure docs out the ass for those bitches at work! Turnabout's fair play! They figure out and panic, I bring out the Contract magic."" 

*Can I trust SIA though?  Yes. No... Maybe. We'll settle on maybe. Isaacs and Layla seem ok. Therese and Lucas might warm up to me if they don't take tonight's beatdown personally. In terms of the organization itself, I have too many unknowns. On the one hand, I'm being monitored and controlled, which sucks. But on the other hand, Isaacs said monitoring was just coffee dates, which isn't bad. And Isaacs is trying to get me Signatory status, which will give me more freedom, not less. Anne and I had to go through worse monitoring after Mom caught her sneaking out to see her high school boyfriend,* I thought with a smirk. *But still, I need boundaries, and I need to be able to push back. I can't be manipulative and have SIA think my ideas are really theirs, but what is the best avenue for pushing back in a way SIA gives in every time?*

I went down that train of thought more. *Now I don't know much about Signatory statuses, but SIA clearly wants me and other Supernatural beings to be completely docile- well, not necessarily* docile*, but integrated with humanity. And if not integrated, mindful and aware of humans and beings who are under their aegis. That's why they're giving me a consulting job and not throwing me naked onto a circle deep underground. Carrot, barely any stick.*

*The short-term plan is to use me to learn more Demonic strengths and weaknesses, which I will assume they'll use to take down mass-murderers faster. Long term, though, I* could *be forced to be a part of a magic hit squad. But Isaacs has to be smarter than that. I don't want to do it, and an employee who doesn't want to be there is worse than an empty spot. I got a real rush from beating Therese and Lucas, I can admit that to myself. Feeling Ilya's terror and smelling her piss herself was pretty hot. Throwing her around felt good. But I haven't told Isaacs that, and I don't think he's trying to acclimate me to violence.*

""I am a creature of pleasure and joy,"" I said aloud, and smiled to myself. ""I am a creature of anger and violence,"" I said, a little less happy. All the memories of me applying a non-light touch to certain people bubbled up. ""I am a-"" The rest was garbled as I couldn't get myself to say out loud words like, 'murderous' and 'vile'. ""I am deceptive and manipulative,"" hurt a bit as my tongue allowed me to speak it.

I slapped both my cheeks and kicked in the water. ""Ok! Self pity time is over! Head back in the game, Lil'. Don't try and say things you can't emotionally handle.""

*Game Time. What's Isaacs planning that's so important he and SIA are happy to drag him here and bend a bunch of rules for me? An inter-species investigative team just sounds dumb. I'm not a private eye, a hundred humans must be easier to find, and I'm not in a TV show. Developing long-distance Demon summon traps is small thinking too. Anything he's come up with, Witches and every other organized group have had centuries to consider. Don't fault him for trying, though.*

I chewed on my lip. ""But what if magic is the wrong avenue? What can a large industrial nation organize that twenty Witches sitting in a circle in a forest can't?"" *Let's say If they have my gene code, because they pulled my hair and blood on Friday night and tested me against their suspect's genes. They can isolate and find other Succubi when kids take basic blood tests, especially before they've grown into it! Which has a real... dystopian feel to it. They could develop pills for Demonic feature suppression, if the kid or parent wants them- You can do all sorts of cool stuff with WitchTech now, even change your sex over the course of a month depending on the species- what if something that powerful could be synthesized for Demons?*

'Would I take it?' Got a definite, immediate 'no'. As much as being a Succubus came with inconveniences and risks, I still enjoyed being myself. *I'd only do it if me... snacking on people caused them permanent damage.* I created another Bealzebubble, Second of his name, to join me in the tub. *Shit, what if that's what that incoming Witch Pharma company's researching, and they want easy access to Isabel and other Supernaturals right here? Well, okay, that's probably too convenient a conspiracy. Treating various foot odors would be way more profitable. But it's worth considering. Even if it's too tin-foil hat.*

""Clever non-magic avenues.... non-magic.""

*What about politics? Isaacs gets me to help him find more Succubi who aren't insane, then we... oh shit. I'd help Declare as a poster child for normal Demons. Succubi would get our own classification, political seats at the table, protections and bylaws, oaths and obligations. I'd have to testify before Congress and become famous, and there would be so much paperwork. Fucking fuck that'd be a lot of pressure.* I squirmed in the tub a little more. *Witches would not be happy, and we'd have to start politicking and told we needed to self-regulate our psychos. I'd be a terrible spy, but Succubi would probably be great in general, right? Other nations haven't harnessed Sup's as well as Americans yet, to my knowledge. Gives the good Ol' USA a serious advantage. Good in a room, good in a bedroom....*

Somewhat more resolute and relaxed, I opened up the Demon Summoning book and looked it over more closely.  *Cloth binding.... At least this one's not trying to be edgy and bound in humanoid skin. Author is simply listed as 'A Dear Friend'. Not creepy. Definitely not creepy.*

Flicking through more of the book, I found spells for forcibly binding Succubi, with the warning that we'd be pissed if they failed. ""I'd be pissed if they succeeded, too. Hmm... Binding collars, contract wording, summoning- aha! Breaking the contract. That looks relevant to my interests.""

""Make sure to be logically consistent, break a contract only when the Succubus is in a containment circle, do not break a contract during sex with said Succubus- safest to just not talk during sex- Let's see... Anything on *me* being able to break orders and contracts... Would it have killed the writer to include a glossary in the back?"" Another, not-so-obvious reason I preferred non-magic studies in college was because humans had a much better system of categorizing and ordering knowledge. Books, shelves, online archives, everything was reasonably orderly because sometimes you need to spend less than a day looking through a hundred books and needed the authors to *not* jerk themselves off about being cryptic and layered in their tomes. *Vampire literature is the worst ever, and it's a hill I will metaphorically die on.*

I flipped through a few more pages and one rather detailed drawing of a witch getting double-teamed by an incubus and succubus in a creative position. ""Chapter Seven... If it speaks to you: Succubi may protest orders they find distasteful, and their professed personalities can be varied. However, Succubi are deceitful and wicked in nature, and will obey direct orders to a point when bound. You cannot make a Succubus physically hurt itself, but emotional or sexual deprivation can-"" *I may have some words with that Gray Witch next time I see her, like 'Why would you sell this to people even if you thought the info wasn't real!?'. But let's table that and keep reading other bits, do some skimming-*  ""Raising and indoctrinating your own Succubus from a pre-awakened state is time-intensive, but reliable once it considers you a master or foster parent. Care must be taken to awaken the Succubus yours-""

*Nope, not dealing with that shit. And I'm not letting this fucker off the hook for calling us 'it'. If this was their guidebook, I hope Isabel's parents died horrible deaths.* I took a deep, angry breath and flipped some more pages to a different chapter. 

""If unwilling or unable to banish or kill their Succubus when no longer needed, a summoner should seek a mutually agreeable end to their contract protecting both parties when the Succubus gets bored. Importantly, do this after it has recently fed and with a quiet, detached demeanor. As an aside, never appear weak before a Succubus, and do not give the Succubus the chance to consider better contracts from other parties unless those parties are already at its mercy. It is my opinion that Succubi do not like to negotiate with an inferior as though they are equals, and severely lack the empathy or ability to plan long-term and choose assistance over further denigration. Succubi can make multiple contracts with different parties, but conflicting terms and conditions can either break those contracts, or allow the Succubus a great amount of choice in fulfilling or ignoring said contracts. Social isolation can be used as- Nope. Nope. I'm done for today.""

I snapped the book shut and floated it over to my bag with magic. *Best thing I'm getting from that is to create a loophole or logical inconsistency, then gag, and beat the summoner senseless.* With my logical mental masturbatory session over, I slid down until my whole head was underwater and screamed for a bit, watching the angry bubbles flowing out of my mouth. I didn't trust myself to punch or kick and bring a physical element to my breakdown though. *Because apparently I can tear cars in half with my hands, and tubs are less sturdy than cars.*

I was interrupted by my phone ding'ing with a message from Richard. I had about ten minutes before he arrived from the restaurant, so I spent the time drying off, and hiding the creepy summoning book as well as my demonic features and demonic rubber ducks. I then found the best clean 'pull it off me now' shirt I had, a pink one with a cute kitten. Satisfied at my preparations, I stormed back to my bathroom and rounded on my  mirror.

""Okay, Lillian, pep-talk time. Richard is human, rather cute, and interested in you. Undeniable facts. You're going to put all this Demon shit aside for the night, and just fuck his brains out and get a snack. You're going to start with some wine, maybe a show, and then get super intimate. It's gonna be great, and it'll be a good way to end your weekend. This is you-time. You're cute, likable, smart, super fuckable, and-""

My doorbell rang, and I ran out to get it. ""Hey! Glad you could make it tonight,"" I said with a smile as I beckoned Richard in. ""Coatrack and shoe section's to the right, nice bottle of red wine and two glasses are on your left. Where I'll take a seat."" I slinked over to my chair and poured each of us a class. 

""Oh, ok, yeah, lemme just-"" With Richard's coat, scarf, and hat taken care of, he made his way over to the table. ""Um, this is kind of new for me. Not unwelcome! I just- it feels like a trick, what with you maybe being Fae.""

I rolled my eyes a bit and took a delicate sip. ""No tricks, no cameras. Just you and me for an evening and we'll see what happens.""

""It's a nice place,"" he said appreciatively. ""Were you with work friends? If you don't mind me asking.""

""It is a nice place I got for a bargain. I work downtown for a tech company, but SIA wanted me to consult on some stuff that's top secret and they're very persistent."" On 'very', I let my foot creep up and gently drift against his leg.

Richard laughed and tried to hide his arousal with another drink from the glass. ""I can only imagine. I had a hundred dollar payment error on my taxes last year and just got *flooded* with letters from the IRS.""

I lifted my glass in a mock toast. ""To government bureaucracy."" Richard struggled not to laugh.

""So uh, I sort of had an ulterior motive for coming here,"" Richard said after a moment of silent drinking and me playfully teasing his legs with my foot. 

*Please don't let it be weird or a trap.* ""Well, *I* had an ulterior motive for inviting you over for a drink,"" I said with a sultry smirk. ""But I'll let it be a pleasant surprise for you.""

""You're obviously, uh. Well, Orphaned Fae, not to be rude. And I was thinking of studying magic as a hobby."" Richard made a figure-eight with his finger, and a trail of frost appeared in midair. *Oh! That's pretty rare, and to sneak under my magic detection abilities... Witch and human couplings usually make a full Witch, or a full human. Though an inter-Witch's magic is always weak.* ""I learned recently that my grandfather was a Witch and I have some small latent talent. I was wondering if you had any advice?""

I stopped myself from looking back to the bathroom where the Succubi book was hidden in my bag. *Don't fuck with Demons, for starters- wait, that sounds a little hypocritical in this situation.*  ""I, um. I didn't even study it myself in college- It's. *Damnit*. I was *just* talking about this with the SIA people over dinner."" I made a small metal scale in my hand and had the ends tip to one side, then the other. ""There's costs to using magic. Benefits to be sure, but *serious* costs. Magic can affect your mind, control your body, ensnare you to Contracts you'd never want to fulfill, and more. So uh, don't get over your head and drunk with power. It gets ugly because humans don't have centuries of actual cultural experience to draw on."" 

At that moment realized just *how* smart Isaacs had to be to last more than ten years dealing with Demon magic and come out on top. I poured myself another, full glass of wine and downed it, to Richard's shock and consternation. *Nights like this make me wish I didn't have an iron liver and could actually get really drunk.*

*But maybe...* ""Or do you just want something that looks cool to pick up the local hot supernaturals?"" *Aha, there's the blush. Who needs ultimate magical power when you're the sexy waiter, anyway? Or a cool car when you can frost drink rims like magic. Alright, I can dig it, I think I know his real angle.*

Richard avoided my eyes with a shy smile adorning his soft features. ""Well. No comment. But I think you enjoyed the Nymph's performance too.""

""Oh believe me, I approve."" *A week ago, I would have tried for both of them together...*  I stood and took the wine bottle with me to the living room. ""Well, now that we've exposed some salacious motives, would you like to watch TV with me?"" 

Within a minute, I was pleasantly horny and splayed over Richard's lap as he sat on my couch. A talkshow host with silly hair was interviewing an up-and-coming human singer-songwriter from Missouri, but I wasn't paying much attention. ""Mmmm... So where do you want to put your hands, mister?"" I rolled a bit to make eye contact and wink. ""I doubt there's a wrong answer.""

""Your... ass?"" He said as he moved one hand hesitantly up and under my shirt to reach there. *Classic, and a solid choice.* I purred as Richard gently pressed and squeezed at one cheek then the other. I could feel him get hard beneath me as he silently debated what to do with the other hand. I licked his palm delicately, then decided to take charge.

I rolled myself up and straddled Richard, kissing him on the lips, then pushing his thumb ever so slowly up over my panties, and into my ass. ""Ahhh,"" I moaned as I rubbed my lower lips slowly against his pants. We kissed deeply, and Richard became a little more sure of himself. His previously-uncertain hand moving under my shirt and grabbing my tit made me moan louder. *Panties: Soaked. Let's be honest Richard, do you even need magic? I bet your dick is going to feel incredible too.*

With a smirk I lifted my shirt over my head, then unbuttoned his, letting my hands roam across his surprisingly fit, dark brown abs. ""Do you like where this is go- Ah!"" My tease was interrupted by Richard's thumb going just a bit deeper in my ass. ""-I'll take that as a yes."" I managed when my eyes stopped fluttering. He chuckled, prompting me to take it up a notch. After a good breathless minute of my tongue in the cute waiter's mouth, I broke off, and whispered in Richard's ear how much I'd love to bring him to my bed so we could continue. He responded by sweeping me up off my feet and carrying me there. We were naked in seconds and raring to go.

Richard leaned over me, clearly marveling at his luck bedding me tonight. ""I'm thinking, you'd like to fuck my ass, wouldn't you?"" I said into his ear as I trailed my hands over his arms and down his chest. ""Mmm, I can tell you want to wreck my slutty ass, don't you?"" I let my fingers drift to his shaft and balls, teasing them. ""But- I want you to fuck my pussy first. Nice and- Ah! *Deep*."" I felt a little happy wave of my magic wash over me,  securing a promise Richard and I would definitely fulfill. *I love being right. His dick feels amazing.*

Richard practically fell into me, and I wrapped my arms and legs around him to give him more leverage to fuck me faster and harder. We moaned in unison, drowning out the talk show's music number. I whimpered and begged Richard to make me come, and delicious sweat dripped onto my tongue as I gripped myself against each push. The first orgasm felt magical, as my back arched and begged him not to stop. The second and third made me shake, desperate for thirty more like it. After he gave me the fourth orgasm he slowed down into a steady, smooth rhythm; his face concentrated on keeping himself in control. I couldn't help but smile.

""Look's like you've earned tonight's prize,"" I gloated as I pulled myself out and then flipped onto my stomach. My perfect, inviting cheeks must have been the most welcome sight in the world, and I shook them a bit. ""I'm perfectly clean too, 'cause *magic*. You can be however rough you wa- Ah! Oh!"" Richard wasted no time pushing himself into my ass. Each successive push made my toes clench and my fingers pull at my sheets. He held me down by my scalp and pulled at it to show me he was going to utterly dominate my ass. I babbled nonsense into the sheets about how much I wanted to worship his cock, take everything he could fuck into me, and taste every drop.

""Do you want to be spanked too?"" Richard whispered in my ear over my inarticulate begging for more of his dick.

""Yes-yes-yes-please-yeah-do-it! Aahhh..."" My core fluttered each time he brought his hand down on me. The slaps didn't register as pain in the slightest, but I felt a good delayed reaction of warmth and increased wetness every time his palm pressed, then released from my skin.  He varied the timing and chosen area so each slap was a wondrous surprise.

And then with a slight grunt, I felt Richard come. He quivered as he emptied himself into me, and I *pulled* just a little. I let out a long, and drawn-out groan as I came a final time and luxuriated in the feeling of pleasure and sustenance. Richard withdrew out and collapsed on the bed next to me. My hand trailed to his cock and massaged it gently as I kissed him a few times to assure him he did a good job.

""Who needs magic when you're this good in bed?"" I laughed. ""Any hope for another round?"" *Or fifteen? Pretty please?*

""Sorry, I... don't think I can keep going,"" he managed, utterly exhausted. I bit back disappointment that we couldn't fuck non-stop until morning at *least*, but such limits were par for the course with a single partner. *But three partners spread out each day would be a wonderful new normal.*

I snuggled a little closer and used magic to turn out the lights. ""No need to apologize, I think we both had a wonderful moment after our long, hard shifts. Would you like waffles in the morning?"" *We could probably get a quickie up on the kitchen counter too before I have to meet up with SIA again...* Richard's eyes drooped as his breathing slowed, but he managed a yes.

I snickered a bit as he mumbled I was some sort of Angel and drifted off. Then I pulled the covers over us and let sleep take me.

""God, my head hurts"" I said in a slur as I stood up. I was home and I fell asleep in a chair from the looks of it. And to my suprise I wasn't alone. Alex, Dimitrios and Nick were in my apartment. Alex was laying on the floor on his chest droolibg on the floor and snoring loudly while Dimitrios was slumped over on my table, he also fell asleep on a chair, thoug he had the luxury of the table to support him. Nick was on the couch, not laying on it per say but on his knees while his upper body dangled on the other side.

""Why the fuck are they here... what happend"" I murmured. I went to my kitchen to prepare myself a coffee, I usually drink it without milk and a little sugar. To some it is bitter, but for me it aids hangovers such as this one. I couldn't remember what happened last night so I had to take a seat and try and remember while the kettle with water boiled.

I went to my coat rack to get my ciggs, I usually hold them in the inner pocket of my jacket. I rummaged through and only found an emoty crumpled up pack.

""Great."" I said to myself, I removed the kettle from the stove and killed the fire. I took a small piece of paper and wrote *Went for ciggs, I'll be back soon* and put it on the table in front of Dimitrios. I can't drink coffee without my morning smoke...

I adorned my black jacket/coat and went outside. Today was colder than usual. As I closed the door behind me and went down the stairs toward the exit. When I exited the first thing to greet me was a Mercedes Benz who went to hell and back. Its black color was now greenish at places due to it probably landing in a bush somewhere along the way. Branches stuck out from here and there as well.

I then remembered we were in a bar. And it all quickly came back to me. 

We found a bar not so far from where the enlistement office was, we went in for one ""one"" drink and got wasted. Alex drove us back again, we crashed a couple of times. It probably looked like that scene from Wolf of Wallstreet, the car wasn't too far out from the original look as well. Lord knows how we found my apartment, and how the fuck didn't the authorities arrest us?

I sighed and took a walk to the grocery store. I still had some money on me, well on my card. The Shils abolished physical money in favor of their credit system. 

I wasn't stopped by any thristy patrols on my way there thanfully, it was 10AM and there was no need to stop everyone I guess.

I went in and bought the ciggs and went back. When I entered my apartment again I saw that everyone was awake and in various stages of fucked up. Nick looked like death, he didn't really take alchohol well from the looks of it.

""Ah, you're back"" Dimitrios said 

""Yeah, wanna a smoke?"" 

""I don't smoke, thanks""

I put the kettle back and made coffee for all of us. I took a sip of my black brew and lit up a cig.

""So, what happend last night, can't remember everything that well."" I said

""Were alive, that's what matters"" Alex said as he sat down and grabbed his mug.

""No shit"" Nick said barely keeping his head up

""Did I tell you guys anything weird last night?"" Alex said with some worry in his voice, I thought back and remembered some pieces if a conversation in the bar.

""You worked on an oil rig before and during the war?"" I said

""Yeah, was stranded there for 2 months. I was the only survivor. The rest either died of starvation or killed themselves. When they found me I was half dead.""

""Hey I remember you said that!"" Nick said proudly

""Did I say anything else?"" 

""Can't remember really"" i said

""The Shils tried to get into our pants when we were drunk"" Dimitrios said, changing the topic.

""Did they get what they want?"" I said

""They got a face full of glass"" Dimitrios said with a grin

""Shit, guys were going on training tommorow. Were fucked"" Nick said

""OK, we have time to recover I'll ju-"" as I went on my pad tosee the date when were departing I see a few missed calls and dozens of messages from Ashara

""Fuck""

Then I see the date

""FUCK"" I stand up

""What is it?"" Alex said

""Were deparing TODAY!""

""How is tha- oooohhh shit"" Nick said as he had a revalation

""What?!"" We all said in unison looking at Nick

""We drank too much looks like, I remember we fell asleep around 4AM yesterday""

""We... what."" Alex said with confusion

""We went into a coma"" I said nodding my head

""Better get ready, I'll reply to the Ashara girl. You guys drink as much water as possible and take a piss. The tap water is drinkable don't worry"" I said, then Alex chugged down his coffee followed by everyone else

I thought of how to word the message to Ashara then I gritted my teeth and wrote

*Heeeyy Ashara, we overslept a bit sorry. Three of the guys, Alexander, Nikola and Dimitrios are at my place so you can oick us up at my place*

A minute later I get a reply

*I won't ask why they are with you. Your escort is coming in an hour*

""Good, they are coming in an hour!""

Everyone took a quick shower and cleaned ourselves up. Then the time came and we got a knock on the door. Opening it we saw a few Shil soldiers waiting at the door. We were escorted to the APC and started going toward the site.

""You guys look like shit"" one of the Shils said

""Why does it reek of alchohol in here?"" Another added

We just stayed silent, I shrugged at them. The rest of the journey was uneventful, other than me purpousfully exhaling mkre air than usual so I increase the smell of alchohol. I didn't care, even though we all brushed out teeth (I have a ton of spare tooth brushes at home) we all still had the smell lingering on us.

We came to out destination, the reporpoused airport, now a spaceport. The ship waiting for the newly recruited human soldiers was massive. The thing towered above us.

""Holy shit"" Nick murmured ""It's beautiful"" the man loved these kinds of things I guess

We were among about 50 humans that are going on the ship. Though I think it can hold thousands. When the large ramp lowered we were greeted by our DI, La'kana. 

""Welcome humans, we will show you ti your rooms. Follow me."" I was able to pack some essentials. The rest of the guys weren't so lucky. The halls of the shil had a tall roof, it was expected since the Shils are taller than us on average. A Shil soldier escorted us to our shared room. Us 4 and another guy are going to be sharing this room as it looks like.

The Shil took a card and placed it on a screen next to the door, the door opened.

""This is your room boys"" the Shil said seductively as she leaned onto the wall next to the door. ""Here's your card"" she looked at me and handed me the card for the door ""I'll be your guard for the time being, and if you need anything just call on me"" she winked

""We gonna be getting some food?"" Nick asked

""Oh! Yes of course, we packed some human food just for you"" she said while still having that annoying smile plastered on her face.

The guys went inside, I was the last one.

""Don't you think leaving a girl alone he-"" the Shil started saying before I closed the door in front of her. 

The room was spacious, from the looks of it it isn't a personnel carrier so much as it is a freighter of some kind. We even had window inside the room, or a screen that showed the outside. I didn't see any windows from the outside.

""I heard it'll take a day to get to the Citadel"" the new guy said with an accent.

""That's quick"" I added

""Oh, yeah. My name is Ivan and this here is Alexander"" 

""You can call me Alex"" 

""This is Nikola or just Nick"" I continued

""And Dimitrios""

""Pleasure to meet you"" he said extending his hand

""Nice to meet all of you, I'm Jan.""

""Polish?"" I asked

""Bingo, the accent gave me away or?""

""Nah, you look Polish"" I said and got a laugh from the guy. After exchanging pleasantries we got into our seats abd prepared for the not so long haul to the Citadel.

After about an hour we got our food delivered, the person delivering the food wasn't a Shil, from what I gathered it was a Ra'kiri. Other aliens, great.

The food was good, it had various dishes such a plain old spaghetti, meatballs, steak and rice with some bread. We even got sweet desserts.

As we finished our meal the ship started slowly ascending. We all gathered around the window to watch. It was something we only had a chance to dream about.

The ship slowly accelarated through the atmosphere then into space, where it picked up more speed. We saw as the Earth was slowly getting farther and farther away.

We stood in silence and awe. And I recited the words of Carl Sagan in my head, I always loved space and listened to it countless times and knew the words by heart.

*Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every ""superstar,"" every ""supreme leader,"" every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there--on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.*

Then I thought to myself

*Of all the creation and destruction brought to that pale blue dot and ourselves. It is our home and in the same time it is our cage. We didn't have time to come to the universe for it came to us. And we are slowly getting out of that cage. The universe made a grivieous mistake, it opened pandoras box and kicked a hornets nest.*

""That's fucking awesome"" Nick said with a smile ""Were in space!""

After we got far enough from Earth the captain of the ship said to brace ourselves, we were going lightspeed. 

That was one hell of an experience. The window from which we saw our home and the sun under which we and all our ancestors made their first steps vanish in a blink of an eye, replaced by a lightshow of various colors. The ship had some turbulence when we entered light speed but it was actually less than I expected.

All of us stayed in our room. We got a few knocks from curious Shils wwntinf to see a human. They didn't have a chance to see us up until this point. The crew of the ship never stepped on Earth's soil after all. And the rumkrs they probably heard made them even more bold in their attempts to establish first contact.

""Good God they are persistent"" Jan said in frustration, he couldn't sleep from the constant knocks and hollers from the outside. We all shared in his suffering as well. 

""Guys, I'll take care of them"" I said as I removed my shirt and lit a cig. Smoking was not allowed on the ship. Well actually there were no rules against it really because the Shils don't smoke, neither do any other species they encountered. But even if there was a 'No Smoking' sign in the room I couldn't care less.

Ciggarete in mouth I grabbed my pad and card. I pressed the card unto the screen next to the door and the door slid open. On the other side were 4 very aroused Shils.

""Hi there"" the Shils were suprised I was shirtless, I knew for them a man going shirtless is the same as a woman being shirtless for us.

""You guys seem kinda lonely so we wanted to stop by and give you some company"" the one in front said, presumably the leader of the group.

""My name is Ma'rana, what's yours?"" She said in a seductive tone while the others waited patiently for my answer. I simply took a ling drag of my cig and blew the smoke directly into the face of the one named Ma'rana.

She coughed and her eyes watered slightly in reaction to the smoke

""*cough* cough* W-what is that?""

""A cigarrete. The burning stick of addiction""

They looked slightly confused but that didn't deter them. So I continued.

""I know all of you are a horny bunch, but sadly we are currently busy getting our well deserved rest. So, to satiate your desire partially, I'll give you some dirty films in exchange for you to fuck off""

The tall purple women looked at each other, they seemed dissapointed, but alas they accepted. I transfered the films thst helped me so much in the past and they left all giddy about the human porn. Oh, they are in for a doozy.

I saw the Ra'kiri woman going with a trolley. She is the cooks stewad and cleaner from what I've observed so I stopped her.

""Oi! You, Panama is your name right?"" *a coincidence that is she named the same as the canal back on Earth*

She nodded

""I'll just warn you that those girls there are gonna make a mess soon. And I apologize in advance.""

""What? If they are going to make a mess why are you apologizing? And hoe do you know?""

""Just take my word for it, have a nice evening"" with that I closed the door *wait was it evening? No, were in space there is not night or day*

""You fucking mad man"" Alex said laughing

""You asshole, we could've gotten laid"" Dimitrios seemed dissapointed. 

""Look, no ones stopping you from joining them."" I said shrigging to Dimitrios.

After about an hour we had another knock on our door, our DI.

""What did you give to those girls?"" She asked with a hint of irritation

""What?"" I said feigning confusion

""Some of them threw up and the rest are sick. Why did you give them those... those gross films!""

""Ohhh that. Look, they were pestering us and we couldn't sleep. So I compromised and gave them those films. Those are the only ones I had sadly so, that's a bummer.""

""You only have THOSE films? What is wrong with you human?""

""Look I have my tastes. In this particular case my taste is that of shit. Quite literally"" she looked at me with absolute disgust

""This will be the last time I will be this lenient. I WILL punish you during training."" And she left

The rest of the journey was thanfully void of any other incidents, other than Alex getting stuck in a closet... The thing had automatically closed when he entered to have look inside since it was quite large. Took us half an hour to figure out how to open it again. But alas we came to the Citadel in one piece.

When the ship landed on the planet where we are going to spend the next 6 months in training. This'll be exciting.

""So, who's taking the first step?"" Nick asked with curiosity ""Were probably the first humans ever to step unto an alien world!

""Nick, haven't you heard that there are other human recruits who came a bit earlier than us?"" His smile turned into a frown. Poor guy.

As we were escorted to the exit of the ship all the new recruits gathered in front of the ramp. Exactly 50 humans, we are going to form into a platoon then be connected to a brigade, din't know which one. During the trip I did some research.

*a total estimated population of 2,3 trillion, that's fucking massive. Forgot how many planets. But out of those countless billions only 67% are Shil'vati. We humans are a drop in the ocean in that statistic, barely visible. My previous thoughts of countering this Empire are put on a standby for now... Just go with the flow Ivan, go with the flow.*

The ramp descended and we were greeted by the rays of light from an alien sun. It was a moment that will reverbarate across the centuries, if humanity survives that is. We might not be the first, but we are among the first.

Our feet greeted the soil, the gravity is lighter thsn that on Earth, its not like I'll float away if I jump. I just feel slightly lighter.

We were shown to our rooms, thankfully I'll share my abode with my new friends and brothers in arms. Alongisde them we'll be having Shil'vati bunkmates. Which is a fucking tragedy if you ask me. 

As I was putting my things onto my new bed I was greeted by a shorter Shil woman. 

""Hello, my name is Lana. What's yours human?""

""Uhh, Ivan. Nice to meet you"" she was polite, that's a good sign.

""I'm La'kash"" the much shorter Shil extended his hand. She had a slightly deeper voice than the rest.

""Ivan, nice to meet you""

""Good to have fellow male company in here"" *fellow?*

""Wait, you're a guy?"" 

""Yes, I'm a male"" *the guy looks like a fucking twink, like he was a woman who had a sex change at some point.

""Uhhh, you are the first Shil male I met. Nice to meet you again.""

We exchanged pleasantries and went to bed to sleep of the jetlag, or spacelag. I donno. We didn't talk too much since we were all tired.

The next day we had our first day of training. We went outside to the field with a track running around the base. Looked quite similar to the military bases we had back home to be honest. 

""My name is La'kana. I'll be your DI for the duration of your training. Now, I want 30 laps for the start. Get started and stay in formation!""

The introduction was rather brief. The jogging group we were in consisted of me, Alex, Dimitrios, Nick, Jan and around 20 others. We were in a formation similar to that of what you would see in war movies in the scenes with the base, a square formation.

I had to admit I never really excersized, the fact I'm a chainsmoker doesn't help one bit. The first 10 laps were easy, although my lungs were burning and I was wheezing like I was suffocating gave me a few concerned looks, I just gave a thumbs up. My legs were holding on for now. The Shils were already lacking behind us humans. Well some humans lacked behind as well, including me. By far Dimitrios and an American fellow looked in far better shape than the rest of us. I know Dimitrios has a military backround so that's it probably.

At around the 25th lap is where my legs were giving up. ""Fah-fahck *wheeze* my legs *wheeze*""

The Shil male was behind me, he was also lacking behind more and more. I barely kept up.

""C'mon *wheeze* La'kash... push it *wheeze*""

""You... seem to be... in a worse state..."" he replied panting heavily as well.

""You okay there buddy?"" The American guy told me, he was in front of me, next to Dimitrios

""He's a smoker"" Dimitrios said to the American

""Oh, I see hahaha"" 

We had one more lap. It now wasn't 'as if I was suffocating' I WAS suffocating. I wasn't getting enough oxygen at all. Damn you Malboro! DAMN YOU!

I was starting to see a black tunnel. Then the American fellow grabbed me and helped oush to the finish. As we were closing in a Shil next to me. The Lana girl was doing a fast walk by now. I grabbed her, nke the American was pushing himslef and effectively two people at the same time. The second one being a massive Shil woman. But it was about 50 meters away.

We made it. I think among the humans, I was in the worst shape. Yes, Alex, Nick and Jan looked exhausted but not to the point as I was. I was ready to collapse.

""30 pushups! NOW!""

*God fucking damn it*

I collapsed to my hands and strted doing the pushups. Hoping to god that those days I spent helping out in the forest gave me some strenght in the hands. Even so, that was 10 years ago, so tough luck.

I made it to 30 with little to no problem actually. The bionic arm did the heavy lifting for me. My other arm ached slightly but it was barable.

""10 more laps then you have break!""

*Fucking hell*

After those 10 laps I just collalsed to the ground. Lana and Dimitrios dragged me to  bench where the rest of us were seated. Nick looked ready to throw up, Alex had his head down and was still panting and Jan, the Polish dude, got the short straw and had to sit on the ground.

""Ivan, you look like shit"" Dimitrios

""As always"" I respond with an exhale.

After the 10 minute break we rehydrated and had to make another 10 laps and 30 pushups alongside some other excercises. I was half dead at the end.

We had lunch and then had cleaning duty. If I didn't have my bionic arm I wouldn't have been able to lift the damn mop.

After all was said and done, we returned back to our rooms and had freetime before lights out.

""I smell like shit"" I said as I crashed onto my bed.

""We all do, you know I'll take a quick shower."" said Nick as he got up from his bed.

""I wouldn't recommend going alone, lone males are a prime target."" Said Lana, our female Shil bunkmate.

La'kash, the Shil male nodded. ""I'll go with you, Lana has a point.""

""Can't I have some privacy?"" Nick retorted

""Sadly not"" La'kash said

Nick sighed and gave into his fate.

""I never joined the military just because of the showers."" I said looking into the ceiling, not being able to move a finger because of exhaustion.

""Wait are the showers communal?"" I said gathering the strenght ti lift my head to look at La'kash

""Yes, yes they are. That's why if you want to take a shower, or go to toilet it's safe to stay in groups.""

*and to make things worse, this place is filled with Shils... fuck*

I dropped my head back down to the soft pillow and closed my eyes. Nick and La'kash went to the showers. I'll stink for the time being, I don't care.

""What happend to your arm? I was meaning to ask that but I forgot. Remembered now"" Jan told me. I could see Lana also perk her head up, seemingly curious as well. The rest knew the story.

""Well, to make a long story short, it was shot off.""

""What?! How did that happen?"" Lana stood up.

""Uhh"" I looked at Alex and Dimitrios and winked, no way I'm telling the full story to a Shil.

""I was caught in the crossfire during a fight and I had my arm blown off. So now, thanks to Shil tech I have a replacement."" *I now remembered I wanted to decorate it...*

""By the Empress, you have to be careful out there."" Lana sat back down. 

""Well, it was an accident. You couldn't really change the outcome too much, I guess"" Jan said.

*Damn do I miss that Volkswagen Golf...*

After a while Nick and La'kash returned from the showers. Nick was a bit fidgety.

""What happend to you?"" Alex asked

""I know the Shil'vati women are pushy but this was a fucking shitshow""

""I tried to stop them but, human males a novelty here still"" La'kash said in apology

""They groped me and one tried to throw herself onto me, Jesus Christ. I had fantasies like that but in real life it's more annoying than anything else.""

""I'll teach you a thing or two Nick, don't you worry!"" I said raising my hand, then dropping it.

""That was harasment"" Alex added ""Can't you report it?""

""Yeah, I heard other humans also had the same problem. Males specifically. Also human females get mistaken for males sometimes.""

They went back and forth, trying to plan out how to minimize the chanches of one of getting raped or something. It was a valid concern. Even Lana and La'kash were giving out advice, thse two are actually good. Glad to see not all Shils are sex crazed maniacs.

*But still, this was officially the first fucking day on base. And already some shit is going down. And were gonna be here for 6 months*

&amp;#x200B;

ACT ONE - DIPLOMATS

&amp;#x200B;

""I am still not sure what we are trying to achieve here.""

&amp;#x200B;

Fleet Admiral Kodor was looking at his tablet, and patting his forehead with his left paw. This diplomatic mission had caused him so much distress that he'd started losing sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

Robert laughed and picked up his tablet. He was a talented Human diplomat who had led various missions over the last decade, signing treaties with half a dozen alien species. He had deep wrinkles around his eyes now, which made him look like an old wise turtle when he was smiling. He was a cheerful chap, always finding clever solutions when everyone else had given up.

&amp;#x200B;

Kodor took another sip of decaf coffee. This Human-originated concoction had been widely popular among Kishtari officers, replacing the traditional bitter-herbs tea they had been drinking for centuries. Despite being mildly toxic to them, due to traces of caffeine still present in the beverage, decaf coffee had a calming and slightly psychedelic effect on Kishtari. Officers and politicians were all microdosing on decaf now. And this new trend coincided with a renaissance in arts and social progress among Kishtari. Coincidence?

&amp;#x200B;

Kodor didn't care one bit about arts. He tucked his deep-blue officer shirt into his trousers, and adjusted his tie because it was too tight, as usual. Human garments were now widely in use among Kishtari, and even the proudest warriors would cover their fur with trendy samurai garments.

&amp;#x200B;

And yet... despite all the cultural minglings and disruptive ideas being shared by both species, there were times when Kodor just didn't GET the Humans.

&amp;#x200B;

Ambassador Robert, cheerful as usual, turned his swivel chair around and pedaled on the floor to get closer to Kodor. The chair creaked and squeaked as it slowly rolled. Robert used to joke that he was riding a big mouse, but Kishtari don't have a very developed sense of humor. Maybe more decaf would change that?

&amp;#x200B;

""Don't worry, my dear friend, we can go through the whole protocol again.""

&amp;#x200B;

Kodor was just standing still, his head moving slowly from side to side.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh gosh, I hope he is not having a decaf overdose again.

&amp;#x200B;

""Oooh-kay. So. When the Galactic Union reached out to Earth in 2071, on the day we now call First Contact Day (how unoriginal), the United Nations of Earth signed a fuckload of treaties. It was Human diplomacy's finest hour, as we managed to make the treaty binding, even for nations that are not technically members of the UN. Yep, even North Korea, the Marie Byrd Land Commune and Kurdistan were forcibly included in the treaty.""

&amp;#x200B;

Kodor stopped moving his head and relaxed his whiskers.

&amp;#x200B;

""Yes, Robert, and that never ceases to amaze me. How Humans are still so reluctant to unite, and yet, they can rally and speak with one voice when it matters the most.""

&amp;#x200B;

""We're not as unified as the Kishtari, but you guys have had a planet-wide civilization and a History without any discontinuity for millenia. Your warring clans and civil wars are a distant memory today. But at the same time... whatever happened to your original languages and dialects?""

&amp;#x200B;

""They were all abandoned, and ancient books were translated into the common language when we proceeded with the Great Kishtari Unification.""

&amp;#x200B;

""There is always something lost in translation, my dear Kodor. A sparkle. A soul"", said Robert, with an enigmatic smile. He continued.

&amp;#x200B;

""So yeah, Humans are still split along linguistic, religious and ideological lines despite the UN acting as some kind of an umbrella organization for galactic diplomacy.""

&amp;#x200B;

The universal translator glitched and translated umbrella as ""large hat for rain"". Humans have a never-ending supply of rarely used words, and they tended to speak in metaphors. Kodor still got the point. He had been working with Humans for twelve years now and had an extensive understanding of Human cultures, traditions and language quirks.

&amp;#x200B;

He looked through the ship's large window. In the distance, he could barely see the brown dwarf star they were orbiting, an ominous dark disk against the starry background.

&amp;#x200B;

The room was completely silent for a few minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

Robert walked to the window and gazed at the faraway nebulas and star clusters.

&amp;#x200B;

""As you might know, Humans tend to be a little... chaotic. The two most powerful Earth-based corporations managed to convince the UN to allow private space colonies. Both corporations had their own private space program, after all, and besides, they were much richer than most Earth countries.""

&amp;#x200B;

He paused. This information was available in the diplomatic mission file, which Kodor should have read.

&amp;#x200B;

Kodor rolled his eyes and said, ""Yes. We have visited the private Earth colony of Muskia once. Pretty bleak rocky planet around Antares, but their underground city was stunning and they grew some nice veggies. It is run by a pompous male human with the title of CEO. The guy is covered with tattoos and piercings and has a weird name, X AE A-12.""

&amp;#x200B;

""And yet, Muskia is not a completely independent Human colony. It has chosen to remain under the jurisdiction of the United States of America, which is a member of the United Nations.""

&amp;#x200B;

""True, Robert. So what's the deal with the Human colony around brown dwarf Luhman 16B, which they have renamed... Happy? Who would name a star system Happy?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Well, anyway, the people of Happy have unilaterally decided to withdraw from the United Nations, which puts them into some kind of a diplomatic void. They're not technically members of the Galactic Union anymore, and all bilateral treaties between the UN and other entities such as the Kishtar Fleet will not apply anymore to them. We suspect they manoeuvered to get an edge, and negotiate a more profitable deal with us.""

&amp;#x200B;

Kodor rolled his eyes.

&amp;#x200B;

""Can't we just IGNORE them? I mean, they're run by a rich corporation but they must not be such an important player in Human galactic endeavors.""

&amp;#x200B;

Robert carefully put the tablet back on the meeting room table, and gazed at the stars for a few seconds before speaking. He had a tired smile.

&amp;#x200B;

""I suspect you have not read the file, my dear Kodor. The colony on Happy owns thousands of patents as well as a massive amount of intellectual rights on anything from industrial processes to cultural products. They are a FTL communication powerhouse. They are also the sole provider of plasma bolt weapons for our entire fleet, as well as a major contractor for the joint Human-Kishtari dogfighter development program. Without them, we're screwed.""

&amp;#x200B;

Kodor massaged his forehead with his paws. This whole situation was making him very uncomfortable. He used to be a fleet admiral and a fine strategist, but since Humans have been around, his role has become more and more diplomatic. And diplomacy was giving him headaches, especially when Human factions were involved.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

ACT TWO - LAWYERS

&amp;#x200B;

The Human-Kishtari ship CFS Juneau was now in orbit around the brown dwarf's only planet. It was a desolate world, without any atmosphere. The icy surface was uniformly red-brown and very dark, with only a few peaks bathed in the brown dwarf star's dim light. At the southern pole, Robert could see an expansive constellation of bright white spots with dotted orange lines between them. This was the planet's main settlement, where half a million Human beings lived and worked. The corporate headquarters were clearly visible at the center of the spider web-like settlement. A tall spire that looked like the funky postmodern version of a medieval tower.

&amp;#x200B;

""They have chosen a world that no other race claimed. Not even the UN star charts list this world as 'inhabitable', since it has no intrinsic value. The planet's only advantage is that its gravity is 80% of Mother Earth. Other than that... it's a very bleak place. Without the imported fusion rectors they run, these poor chaps would freeze to death immediately.""

&amp;#x200B;

Kodor shook his head in agreement.

&amp;#x200B;

""Kishtari don't settle brown dwarf worlds, they're not worth the trouble. We even considered building secret shipyards on rogue planets at some point, but the military strategist who proposed that got fired.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Literally?""

&amp;#x200B;

""No. Unfortunately. He just lost his job.""

&amp;#x200B;

""The delegation from the Happy system settlement will arrive shortly. They're sending their lawyers ahead of time to start negotiating the trilateral treaty. They refused all our preliminary treaty clauses and insist on negotiating on their terms.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Lawyers?"" Kodor looked as if he was about to choke.

&amp;#x200B;

Human lawyers were feared across the whole quadrant now.

&amp;#x200B;

""But don't worry, we anticipated their dick move. We have hired the best lawyers we could find on Earth. They're the most fearless, cunning bunch of bastards I've ever seen. They would make a Kishtari warrior tremble in his fur.""

&amp;#x200B;

""What kind of lawyers have you found?""

&amp;#x200B;

""We've hired half a dozen lawyers from a medical malpractice firm. They said it was gonna be a piece of cake.""

&amp;#x200B;

Robert was interrupted by the meeting room's doorbell. He pushed a button on the table's console and the door opened. One of the lawyers was standing there with a thick pile of papers in his hands.

&amp;#x200B;

""Can we help you?"", Robert asked.

&amp;#x200B;

""Sir, we have found twenty-five spaceship code breaches in the CFS Juneau. This place is a deathtrap. These put the crew in grave danger, making their workspace much more hazardous than it should be. With your authorization and signature here (bottom of last page, yes, here) -- we will send a letter of formal notice to the fleet headquarters. You guys will get a substantial pay raise when they settle. Oh and by the way, Gus scorched his hand with the coffee machine and are suing you.""

&amp;#x200B;

Kodor looked absolutely appalled, and Robert could see the fear in his eyes.

&amp;#x200B;

He laughed loudly, promptly signed the paper, and looked at Kodor with a grin, saying ""Told you these lawyers were the absolute best.""

&amp;#x200B;

Later on that day, the Happy system colony's legal team arrived on the CFS Juneau. Lawyers from the legal teams sat on both sides a long wooden table in the ship's largest meeting room. They then debated for twelve hours nonstop, sometimes yelling and throwing a glass of water or a fountain pen at each others. The power struggle was epic. They were so professional.

&amp;#x200B;

Kodor just locked himself in his cabin, and turned off his comm.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

ACT THREE - SHOWTIME

&amp;#x200B;

The day of the ceremony had finally arrived.

&amp;#x200B;

Robert and Kodor stood in the ship's observation lounge, where they had an amazing view of the planet below. A few dozens other dignitaries were present, including the colony's CEO Charlotte, her husband, their kids as well as their genetically modified Pokemon pets. The Pikachu high-fived one of the kids and made some sparks with its tail. Some of the dignitaries were wearing traditional Earth clothes, and even medieval garbs.

&amp;#x200B;

One by one, they all signed the final tripartite treaty.

&amp;#x200B;

Charlotte gave a highly inspirational speech, which was broadcasted to the local colony and to the rest of the Galactic Union's worlds through Collapsed Space FTL comm channels.

&amp;#x200B;

""... and thus, with this contract, we are gaining exclusive movie rights as well as derived product exclusivity on any newly discovered non-sentient creatures in the Human and Kishtari sectors of the galaxy...""

&amp;#x200B;

Kodor wasn't sure his universal translator was working properly. He whispered to Robert, ""I don't understand this last bit. What are they talking about? Contract?""

&amp;#x200B;

Robert (whispering) ""Their corporation has been signing lucrative deals for more than a century, acquiring rights for anything from old folks tales to science-fiction adventures. They sign contracts, not treaties.""

&amp;#x200B;

Kodor was still puzzled. ""What? How? What the...?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Just shut up and listen... I'll brief you later. Your universal translator wouldn't understand the difference. It's all fine.""

&amp;#x200B;

Outside the spaceship, they then saw a saucer-shaped but highly asymmetrical fighter ship emerging from the dark side of the planet. Three minutes later, the ship passed really close to the observation lounge's bay window, and people in the crowd were shouting ""Ah!"" and ""Wow!"", pointing excitingly at the fast-moving saucer.

&amp;#x200B;

What an odd design. The ship had an array of powerful plasma engines. But it could barely keep its stability, and cold gas thrusters had to fire furiously in all directions to prevent it from flipping over.

&amp;#x200B;

Kodor looked even more puzzled than earlier.

&amp;#x200B;

""Why would they build such an inefficient ship? This has to be the slowest, least maneuverable ship in the whole galaxy.""

&amp;#x200B;

He looked up the ship's name in his tablet's dictionary. It was something like ""Thousand years old bird with claws.""

&amp;#x200B;

It didn't look like a bird even one bit. They had not even bothered to paint feathers on the silvery grey hull.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, five smaller fighter ships emerged from the other corner of the bay window, and started shooting bolts of plasma at the saucer ship. The ship easily dodged the deadly plasma trails, and fired back. Three of the globe-shaped ships exploded, and the two remaining ones returned to the planet's surface.

&amp;#x200B;

Before Kodor could open his mouth, Robert spoke. ""The small ones are drone ships. They are re-enacting a mythical space battle just for our enjoyment.""

&amp;#x200B;

Robert started cheering and clapping his hands as more globe-shaped ships with bizarrely perpendicular winglets took off and engaged the saucer-shaped ship. The show was excellent and the crowd was thrilled, watching the colorful plasma bolts, lasers and torpedoes hitting their targets and blowing up drone ships.

&amp;#x200B;

The saucer-shaped ship then docked with the CFS Juneau.

&amp;#x200B;

As they were the highest ranking representatives of the United Nations and of the Kishtar Fleet, Robert and Kodor were brought ahead of the group. They were to meet with the saucer-ship's pilot.

&amp;#x200B;

The airlock door opened, and a stunningly beautiful woman with braided blond hair emerged. She was wearing a renaissance blue dress, and a miniature horse was trotting happily on her side.

&amp;#x200B;

She bowed in front of the two ambassadors, and said:

&amp;#x200B;

""Hi, I am major Rapunzel of the Disney(R) Space Force. Welcome to the Happy Dwarf system. Please step into the Millennium Falcon, and I will fly you to our planet's capital, Magic Kingdom.""",/r/HFY/comments/ouv8tw/first_contract/,8
36,ouy9ws,HFY,Sat Jul 31 04:34:54 2021,Im Not Going Alone,"“Svericka, dammit they have managed to take the lower levels.” Davis cursed as he heard the report from his second in command, and looked behind him at the rest of the crew, the survivors from the Tarvegian assault. 

They all looked terrified and rightfully so, Tarvegians enjoyed hunting down their prey by letting them loose and turning their Sand Hounds loose while they used primitive Shakka Tar, a very odd weapon that propelled organic lances that injected a painful toxin on impact. 

The only thing he could equate them too would be poisoned tipped arrows with a bow back on terra. That did not help his situation at all. He was down about fifteen security crew, and the rest were on the other side of the ship, holding down the escape pods while he devised a plan to punch a hole through the Tarvegian line that now sat in the only path they had to the escape pods.

Being the only human on board a very alien vessel had its downsides he supposed, but the upsides were that a lot of aliens still weren’t used to even seeing a human, and even though they had joined the galactic community at least five decades previous, they weren’t exactly the most prolific race compared to those like the Tarvegians, the walking Komodo dragon assholes; and as such they knew next to nothing about him.

If they had read up they might not have attacked, for some reason races that met his own seemed indisposed to fear his race, something about walking prey down or something, he didn’t really care. 

his responsibility was to get the rest of his crew, three blue Taka, which looked funny enough like the blue monkey people from that old flick Avatar, five Morkans, which looked like howler monkeys if they had four arms, and two Feertu-a: a mother and child, at least he believed that to be the case, which looked like bipedal mixes of a leopard with a rhino horn oddly enough.

He thought about it and pulled his assault rifle to his chest, the strap holding it there while he checked ammo for his hand cannon and grenade count. Finishing that he slapped a mag into his custom Scar-L and formed the civilians into a semi line behind him with one of the Taka, an older male by the looks of it, brought up the rear, a base Morkan make shotgun braced on his shoulder as he walked backward, double and triple checking to make sure nothing was coming up behind them.

From what Davis remembered the older Taka’n hailed from the military sector of his planet, and graduated with honors in combat. Good, always better to have a veteran covering his ass.

Davis’ focus became sharp as movement came from one of the passages in front of him, and he opened fire with a burst of three 5.56 rounds into the chest of the first Tarvegian which was investigating the sound they were making. 

he went down with a loud keening noise and the young Feertu-a whimpered, and clutched her mother’s leg harder as they continued on, the sound of Tarvegians answering the death keel of their brethren echoing in the metal halls.

———————————————————

“Sonofabitch, can’t these walking dinosaurs take a damn hint and screw off?!” Davis snarled as he put rounds down range, a third Sand Hound going down along with its handler. 

They had gotten about halfway to their objective of the escape pods and his second in command had radioed in, saying reinforcements were on their way, but wouldn’t be there for at least a cycle, meaning he had to get these civvies to the escape pods alone. They had lost one of the Morkans along the way, a sand hound had come from the vents and dragged the poor monkey away, squealing in terror.

He hoped they had killed him quick, but his hope was usually unfounded when it came to Tarvegians. 

The rest had grouped tighter after that, not wanting to be dragged away, or at least be in grabbing distance so they might be able to be dragged back.

Davis didn’t think the Tarvegians would try it again, if only because due to his impeccable aim and the Taka’n veteran’s exceptional skill putting clouds of lead into multiple targets at once, they were down quite a few warriors.

He knew this meant one thing, they would start gearing up for a swarm tactic soon, the bastards loved to throw caution to the wind when they knew they were screwed, and just go for an all out assault to take as many as possible with them.

There were upsides and downsides to this, upside is with the time they would take to gear up, he could most likely get all the civvies to the escape pods, downside was if his timing was wrong he would be on the receiving end of a scaly horde from hell that would tear him and his small group to shreds.

He started to run, noticing the hallways were oddly quiet, and cursed. They were already beginning to gear up. He pushed them to go faster and the child feertu-a started to cry and must have misstepped because she tripped and fell, her mother being pushed along with the Morkans, despite her panicked protests. Davis switched with the veteran Taka and told him the directions and ran back to scoop up the child.

As Davis grabbed her and turned, the group turning a corner to a straight shot to the escape pods he heard it.

It started as a loud drumming, then came the roar. The damn Tarvegians had started their war chants, and that meant they had started their death charge.

The little cat/rhino girl whimpered and buried her nose against his chest and he held her close with one arm while aiming down the hallway behind them, sweating as the war chant pettered out.

Davis sprinted to the corner the group had turned down and got a glimpse behind him as he swung around it, a mass of yellow green, chitin armored bodies snarling and climbing over each other to get at him.

He heard the clang of several Tarvegian lances hitting the metal behind him, and he screamed the f-word, hoping the little girl didn’t understand English very well.

Laughter from the Tarvegians answer and he cursed again, some of the walking demonic salamanders knew English, great, that meant they did know he was there and just didn’t care.

He hated it when he found races that didn’t care, they were always the worst races. He had about a 1000 meter run to the escape pod bay, the hatch was open and his second in command was there, screaming at them to hurry up. 

Bless that orange shark faced Kataktoan. He was an alien after his own heart. 

The girl was crying now, and he could see her mother being held back by the veteran Taka, while she clawed and tried to run past his second in command. 

He cried out as a sharp pain tore through his right shoulder, and almost fell. He didn’t even bother to look, judging from the growing pain and feeling of burning, a Tarvegian lance had pierced his shoulder. He was halfway, no time for distractions, he kept running.

Three quarters the way and he felt two more pierce him, one in his calf, the other right next to the first one, the fucking assholes.

Davis screamed in pain and somehow kept going, the girl silently weeping now. She didn’t think they were gonna make it, the lass had never met a red blooded American human then, one borne and bred in the woods of Michigan, and was used to running with  wounds while trying to chase down a pissed off animal.

Granted that animal was usually not shooting at him, nor had pals, and also wasn’t chasing him, but semantics.

He reached the door and shoved the girl into his second in commands arms, his confused look turning to one of panic and shock as Davis slammed the door closed behind her, leaving him there.

————————————————————

I could feel the poison seeping to my chest, and the pain in my other wounds was only getting worse. Tarvegian poison, no cure, slow and painful death.

I knew my song had been sung. I felt another lance hit my other shoulder and snarled, turning and unloading the rest of my magazine into the oncoming horde. Killed a few, the rest seemed to slow as they regarded the situation and made their stupid snarling and clicking noise before one stepped forward.

I slumped against the specialized blast door, my empty gun hung useless from my neck. The I presumed was the leader finally reached me, leaning down as he sat on his haunches and sneered in a very reptile like way. Or that was just his face, either way I didn’t care.

“You are ssssstrong, hooo- mahn.” It hissed out, some of the letters messing up but still decent English.

“Yeah? Well since I’m so strong, why don’t you take your scaly asses off my damn ship.” I sneered out and the fucker had the audacity to cackle, before sniffing my wounds, and running his tongue over the one on my shoulder.

“I think not hoo-mahn, you ssssee my kind is hungry, and I feel after you die from our nectar, the ressssst of your crew will tassssste…. Delicioussss.” It snarled, tasting my blood with a feral lizard grin on his face.

I started to laugh, the pain starting to get worse. I could hear the other’s pounding on the door, trying to get out to help me the brave fools, even hear a set of small fists funny enough.

The Tarvegian leader seemed a bit bemused and looked at his enterouge as if they understood the reason for my laughter.

“Why are you laughing Hoo-mahn, I do not underssstand. The leader snarled and leaned back down to look me in the eye.

“Because.” I said and held the pins of three grenades up in my hand, the shaking from pain almost stopping me.

“If I’m dying, I’m not going alone.” I snarled as we were engulfed in fire and light.",/r/HFY/comments/ouy9ws/im_not_going_alone/,31
41,ov7ciu,HFY,Sat Jul 31 16:41:21 2021,The Voice in His Head(Urban Fantasy HFY): Chapter Twenty-Seven- Royal Blood and Cascadian Magic,"I woke up early the next morning, as custom. I’d learn to function without a lot of sleep. I rolled out of bed. After a quick shower I dressed in a new pair of trousers and a shirt, this was followed by a vest and blazer. I always wore my pentacle these days. The emergency shield alone was worth it. Bethany had taken to using the guard statues around the town house as impromptu ambush points.

Being attacked by a four-hundred-pound piece of pottery tends to ruin your day, and I’d upgraded the shield from a standard scuto to the more advanced contego shield.

I’d other plans for enchanting. A set of rings that would hold spells ready to go. Maybe some sort of staff that could hold a bit of Geomancy. I had half a dozen ideas in my journal. After I got dressed, I left my room and walked across the hall to knock on Emily’s door.
She opened the door almost instantly. She was dressed in the boy’s clothing.
“You know that female mages wear dresses, right?” She glared at me.
“I’m aware Andrews, but I’m not going to be living in Emrys, and frankly, I’d rather be able to dress in something I can move in. Besides, these are all the clothes I own.” She replied.
I led her downstairs to the kitchen and we quickly ate breakfast. Bethany was already there. She looked worn, more tired than I’d seen her in a while.
I went to grab a cup of tea. Before I took a sip, I looked at Bethany.
“It’s safe, Stephen.” She said. I took a swig of tea and grabbed a piece of delicious looking streaky bacon off the platter, using it to make myself a sandwich, I bit into it. Savoring the crunch of the bacon and the delicious eggs.
“At least the tea is.” She said with a smile.
I froze mid-chew, and she laughed.
“As I told you yesterday, I’m not going to try and poison you today.” She replied. She was reading the Morning copy of the London Eye. In enormous letters, the headline yelled, “Silken Veil destroyed! Silas Goodfellow deceased! London Court Sanguine in uproar!”
I resumed chewing. Emily had chosen a couple slices of toast and some of that fruit Bethany insisted upon serving. She looked at us both as though we were crazy.
“Are we taking the train today?” I asked.
“Not today, we’ll be taking a portal directly to Matilda’s. After we get Emily’s new clothing, I will be escorting you both to the bank. Emily, do you have a proper set of implements?”
“I have my pentacle and wand, along with a set of white and black handled knives I bought from a vendor in Undertown.”
“That’s a dangerous place for someone your age to go. Anything could happen to you there.” Bethany replied.
“Like being kidnapped by a vampire and watching the only mundane friend I have killed?” Emily said, taking a sip of tea. Her gaze was unblinking.
“Point taken.” Bethany said.
I had finished my sandwich at that point and was checking my possessions.
“Bethany, are we responsible for whatever the Silken Veil was?” The silence and her haggard expression were everything I needed to know.
“Are you ready?” She asked us, and we nodded.
She took a runic set out of a pouch and arranged them in a line. Then activated them with a bit of power. An arch opened up in the air, and a portal sprang to life.
“Why aren’t we using the mirror?”
“The fixed portal network is undergoing maintenance.” She said, and she stepped through the portal. I followed behind her, and Emily followed closely behind us.
We emerged into Madam Matilda’s plush parlor. She was already waiting for us.
“Hello again Bethany.” Matilda said with a smile.
“Hi Matilda. Sorry about the short notice.”
“It’s no problem at all Beth. Tell me, are you making a habit of finding strays?” She asked.
“It appears that way.” She replied.
“What will the young miss need?” She asked.
“A full set of junior miss clothing.”
“Boys clothes.” Emily said.
“Hmm?”
“I’m not wearing dresses. Or those flouncy dresses those legacy bitches wear. I want boy’s clothes. Trousers and shirts, and boots.”
Bethany gave her a look.
“You want clothes you can fight in.”
“Always. I will never be helpless again.” Emily said.
“It’s unorthodox, but it is not something unheard of. I can make the shirts in brighter colors, and the vests the same. For formal functions, a dress is imperative. However, made in the right length, it should be durable, and the sleeves would need to be looser. If you don’t lace the corset that tightly, then it would afford a small amount of protection, especially if you have the bone carved with endurance runes. It would be more costly, but if her chemise and pantaloons were made of Arachnesian silk, it would turn away most spells, and catch any arrows.”
I really hated the faux Victorian clothing that seemed to be all the rage in magical society. The underwear I had to wear was some weird sort of one-piece jumpsuit. Fortunately, I only had to wear that garbage at school.
“Are we designing battle armor or a dress?” I asked.
“In certain environments, they’re the same thing.” Bethany said.
“You're getting new clothes as well.”
“My clothes are fine.” I replied.
“No, they’re not. You’ve grown at least a foot since we were here last. Grab a room.”
The next hour was filled with the usual flurry of measurements. At the end, Bethany, when we were done, the bell jingled once, and Amy walked in. It was odd seeing her in the flowing robes that passed as everyday dress in magic society. Normally, she dressed in mundane clothing.
“Do you have the paperwork?” Bethany immediately asked. Amy produced a piece of sealed parchment, and Bethany placed it in her bag.
“Official as of this morning.” Amy replied.
“Thank you.” Bethany said, she quickly paid, and we left for the bank. We entered the main lobby and after conferring with a teller, a dwarf quickly escorted us back to a wood paneled office.
“Madam Andrews, what can I do for you?”
“I need to meet with Wraithgrip.” She said, the dwarf bowed, and nodded, and led us to his offices.
The dwarves, despite myths to a contrary, valued three things. Gold, Smithing, and Gold. They’d gained a reputation over the years. You had the goblins of South and North America. The gnomes of Zurich, but the ones most feared? The ones with the ability to field an army? Those were the dwarves.
“I’d like to open two sub accounts for my charges. They are to have unrestricted access to these accounts, and their allowances are to be deposited into them. Here are the papers from the Council Majeure signifying my adoption of Emily York.” She said and produced the piece of parchment from earlier. The dwarf unsealed it.
“Everything seems to be in order.” He produced two sheets of paper, along with a fountain pen.
“Have your charges sign these. The fountains are blood pens. That way the contract is magically binding.” We reached for the papers, and we both read through them twice. She picked the piece of paper up and took her own pen out of a pocket.
“The exclusivity clause is an utter tripe. Signing that will only allow them to bank in Europe.”
“I’d like to raise privacy wards, Master Wraithgrip, if you don’t mind.”
The dwarf raised an eyebrow.
“Madam Andrews, if you insist upon doing so, then do so.”
Bethany raised her wand and waved it like she was conducting an orchestra. A dozen spells flew out her wand and coated the airs and walls around us in defensive magic. She completed the set of spells with a flourish.
“I have it on excellent authority that trouble is brewing in Germany.” She said.
“That new political party?” He asked, and Bethany nodded her head.
“You warned us about that business with the Romanovs, despite our failure. How do you suggest we prepare for this?”
“How I suggest you prepare depends on how favorably our negotiations go.”
“What would you like?” Wraithgrip asked.
“The transfer fee will be waived between accounts, and the exclusivity cause will be rendered null.”
“Done.”
“Finally, we come to the issue of aureus reclaimed. I propose a two-percent withholding rate.”
“Midas’ standard is twenty-five.”
“Let’s be reasonable. Say, five, percent.”
“Eighteen.”
“I could just take my business to the Gnomes.”
“You’re being awfully obstinate about this one issue, Madam Andrews.”
“7 percent.” Bethany said.
“8, and not a dupondos less.” The dwarf said.
“I can agree to those terms, on the condition that the initial percentage deposit be waived.”
“You’re lucky your one of our bigger clients Madam, but your terms are fair, and our bargain is stuck.” The contracts vanished, and new ones came into existence. Bethany read over them, and nodded, and we signed them.
“Now, will the initial deposits come from your vaults here or another source?”
“My charges have done a bit of treasure hunting it seems. Children, produce your chests.”
We did. Bethany grabbed one out of her pocket as well, and we enlarged them, and placed them on the floor.
“Each of those chests contains roughly seventy-two thousand aurei. My chest contains two-hundred and fifty tremissis. I want that divided equally between the two accounts.”
The dwarf waved an orb in front of each chest.
“Well played Madam Andrews, may I ask where you got such a bounty from.”
“We found it, not her, and you may not.” Emily said.
“My charges have been remarkably tight lipped about where they’ve gotten this gold from.”
“It is curious that your two charges, a mundane born, and a legacy all brought nearly identical sums in, all in the same time frame.”
Emily and I shared looks.
“Do you think we should tell him.” I sent with a bit of telepathy.
“Well, if we fleece Merlin out of the Silver, Bronze and Tremissis the Room has, we’d probably get William’s fees knocked down to something resembling ours.” She replied.
“I agree. Me or you?”
“You.” She said.
“Hypothetically, Sir Dwarf. If four more deposits were to make their way into your coffers. In say, amounts similar to this in Tremissis. In Dupondos, and in Drachma, what impact would that have in, say, lowering the Mundaneborn’s rates to, say, those identical to ours.”
“If such a deposit were to make their way into the coffers of Midas International, we’d be thrilled to lower our rates for such high-profile clients.”
“I would need that in writing of course.”
“I’d assume you want five copies of such an agreement?”
“You would be assuming correctly.”
“Continuing on with hypothetical situations. I’d say you could expect such a deposit in roughly a year and a half.” I replied.
“Is there any other business we have today?”
“I want to commission implements for Emily. She has a pentacle, and the white and black handles. Give her the rest, and have it prepared by day's end. I also want two consecrated bells, on slips of black ribbon.”
“I assume you're willing to use the Time you have stored in your vault?” Wraithgrip asked.
“No, I won’t. You’ll be responsible for that.”
“Absolutely not.”
“You will, or Selene will receive word that Midas has been receiving payments from the Sanguine Court to provide Fae blood to the late Silas Goodfellow.”
“You dare say her Name in our territory?” Wraithgrip said.
“I dare, and do, and will so twice more. It is quite odd how fires have a way of burning away deceit and bringing the truth to light.” She said.
“Certain things are better hidden in the dark.”
“Like the death of three dozen changelings in as many months?” Bethany asked.
Emily and I shared another look.
“I think an arrangement could be made, and we’ll have those implements delivered by courier no later than the day's end.” The dwarf replied.
“I’d hope so.” Bethany said.
“Now, unless you’d like to discuss any other business arrangements, I’d like to discuss what preparations we’d need to make regarding future tensions on the continent.”
“Beginning in a couple years’ time, I’d say ’33 at the earliest, and ’38 at the latest, I would completely pull Midas out of Germany, France, the Netherlands and Italy. I’d put those branches into complete lockdown. Then I would consider raising your siege wards in your London Branch, perhaps by Summer of ’40. From there? Concentrate on Greece. I understand that Midas Africa is practically a business unto itself, but I would certainly consider having them go into lockdown soon after along with the Grecian branch. In short? I’d suggest a complete pullback of all Midas interests and a lock down of their branches by no later than ’33.”
“You’re talking about a global withdrawal.”
“Yes. A war is coming that will give humans the ability to rip reality in two. In a decade’s time they will surpass mages in combat ability.”
“The end of the Perdition is coming then?”
“It is a distinct possibility. Their governments know. Mages make up ten percent of the population. In the upper echelons, magic is well known, and even accepted.”
“You’ve given me a lot to think about. A lot to tell my superiors. Is there anything else?”
“Not that I know of.”
“Well, if your business is finished, I can supply a portal back to your residence.”
“We have our own transport arranged, but I appreciate the gesture.”
“Very well.” Wraithgrip said. Bethany dispelled the privacy spells and we left the bank. We went back to the shop, and Bethany supplied another rune set that created a portal. We returned home.
“Is everything you said true?” Emily asked. We’d made a late lunch of sandwiches.
“Yes. Everything I spoke of will come to pass.”
“Why don’t you stop it then. If you know so much about what’s to come, why can’t you do something to stop it?”
“I’ve tried. It’s out of my control at this point, I personally have no choice in the matter.” She said, and she gave me a look. A chill went down my spine. Could I interfere with that war? I didn’t know if I could do that. That kind of responsibility? Gods, I couldn’t, I didn’t, even know where to begin with that kind of implication. My brain literally short circuited.
“Regardless of what the future holds, tonight, I’m taking another step to prepare you tonight, Stephen. Emily, I’d also like to include you in this.”
“What are we doing?” I asked.
“As the last day has taught us, you particularly Emily, sometimes, the enemy has the upper hand. Sometimes you are caught without your implements. Tonight, I’m giving you a solution to that. We’ll begin as soon as the delivery from the dwarves arrives. In the meantime, these are the texts I need you to memorize.” She produced a trio of books from thin air. They were the Key of Solomon, The Lesser Key of Solomon, and the Binding and Compulsion of Spirits.
“Emily, I’m assuming that Stephen has continued on with the tradition of not knowing when to keep a secret, and telling you about the Librum spell?”
Emily nodded.
“How did you know?” I asked.
“My brother did the same thing, and you are more like him than you know.” She replied.
We quickly memorized the trio of texts. These were books on rituals, and I felt pressure built up behind my sinuses, followed by a wave of vertigo. Bethany handed us headache potions, and we took them.
“I’ll give you both time to adjust to the new information, and I’ll retrieve you later tonight.” We both retired to our rooms. I took a quick nap, and then went to the training range to perform my daily drills. The day passed, and night fell. We had dinner, and then met back up with Bethany in the foyer.
“We’ll do this on the island. Stephen, you’ll find we made some improvements.” I hadn’t been to the island for almost a year. We traveled up to the library.
“The mirrors are back in order.” She said. She walked up to the mirror and activated the series of rune buttons below it. The portal opened and we saw a vision of the island’s cottage beyond.
We walked through the portal into the cottage, and out of the cottage and into the field.

A dais of stone had been constructed in the center of the island, and at five equidistant points, a diamond obelisk had been raised from the earth. The obelisks were carved with hundreds of runes, and fine copper and gold wire was twisted around them in intricate patterns. Each rune was lit with the pure white-blue light of magic. On a pedestal in the center of the dais, a diamond lodestone softly glowed.

Another smaller stone platform had been erected nearby. This one was like a smaller version of the first, except the runes carved into it were jagged, different than the other, and glowed a black-green.
“What are these?”
“The larger of the two is an ether spire. It charges lodestones and then teleports them to one of our warehouses. Then it retrieves another from the blank warehouse. The smaller is a ritual platform. Today we will be using it to summon a cacodemon for each of you. You read the ritual, and you know how to do this. Once you begin the ritual, under no circumstances do you break the circle. Contain the cacodemon in the bell.” She said, and she gave each of us a silver tinkling bell that was attached to a length of black ribbon.
“Which of you would like to go first?” She said.
Emily stepped forward.
“I’ll do it.”
“The chalk and candles are in the chest.”
Emily nodded, and took the necessary tools out. Six candles, a piece of magnetic chalk, a leather-bound book and a ruler. She carefully made a pentacle with the chalk. At each point she lit one of the candles, and the flame was the sapphire of her aura. Finally, when she was done, she carefully sketched out a circle. She stood at the edge of the circle, opened the leather-bound book, lit the last candle, and rang the silver bell in her hand. Her voice was full of conviction, and I felt her power crash against my skin like dozens of hot needles.
“I call upon the four princes! I call forth Egyn of the North! I call upon Amaymon of the South! Oriens of the East! Paymon of the West! Guard this operation! Protect thine operator! With my blood, I bind this circle!” She pricked her finger with a needle and placed it on the circle. I felt the snap of magic as it coalesced.
“I call upon the nameless! The chittering hordes! I call thee up imp! Appear this night, in this place!” The candles flared, magic surged, and a creature appeared in the circle. The creature was six feet tall and covered with a fine down of black fur. Its hands had three clawed fingers each. Its feet were cloven hooves. A pair of leathery bat-like wings grew from its back, and it had the face and head of a man.
He looked at Emily.
“Greeting operator, how might I help you this fine night?”
“I wish to enter in allegiance with you. To hold you as a sword against my enemies. Do you agree?”
“Let me out of this circle, and I will ensure your enemies fall as scythe before wheat. Break the spell binding me, and I will protect you till the end of your days.”
“Only if you submit willingly to be bound forever to this bell in my hand.”
“I will not be bound by some mortal girl. Release me!” The demon snarled and slammed it’s tridactyl hand against the barrier.
“Then you leave me no choice. I bind you demon.”
“You’ll die, you little bitch!” It snarled.
“I bind you, by Dawn. By Dusk. By Day!” Emily shouted.
“I’ll rip your head off and fuck your skull, little orphaned bitch! No one wants you, not even your barely magical mother wanted you! No one needs you!”
“I bind you by Morgana. By Vivienne. By Leanna!”
“I’ll eat your innards and make you watch! I’ll tear that boy to shreds. Your world will burn before I am through!”
“I bind you demon, forever and a day! Forever and a memory of forever! Forever and a century more! By the bell in my hand, by the book at my feet, and by the candle that lights my way this night! Thrice by thrice by thrice! Bound be, demon! As I will it to be bound!” Emily said. The demon let out a wordless snarl. An incoherent shriek of anger and rage.
“Fiat. Fiat. Fiat!” She shouted. She dashed the candle to nothing but bits of wax, and slammed the book shut. Then she rang the bell. When she did, the candles extinguished themselves, and the bell glowed green and black.
“Stephen, perform the ritual.” I reset the ritual for myself. I lit the candles, closed the circle, and called forth the princes and the imp. My demon appeared, and unlike Emily’s this one had the body of a lion, and the head of a man. It had the cloven hooves of a goat, and its fur was whiter than fallen snow. It spoke with a female’s voice, a voice of pure seduction.
“What do you wish, oh great operator, who’s wisdom is greater than Solomon? Let me free and I shall shower you with riches beyond compare, and the world will bow before you.”
For one fleeting second, I was tempted to break the circle. To let this wondrous creature loose. Then my common sense kicked me in the ass.
“I think not. Submit to me, temptress, agree to be bound forever to my hand.”
“Foolish boy! I will not be bound! You will be mine!” The demon snarled.
“I bind you demon! I bind you by Dazzling Element! By Royal Blood! By Cascadian Magic!” I screamed, thoughts rushed through my head, and it seemed as I thought I’d done this before. It was remembering a half-forgotten dream, or a dream of a dream. It was like reliving memories long burned to ash, faded to dust and left to settle at the bottom of my soul.
“You don’t belong on this plane, and I will cut your souls from your broken body and return them to whence they came!” The demon screamed, like razor blades on a chalkboard.
“I bind you demon! I bind you to my cause! By Time! By Birth! By Sleep!” The words flowed out of my mouth, and it was like walking down a road I’d traveled down a hundred times before.
“I’ll lap your blood from your cooling corpse! That boy you are so infatuated with will grovel at my feet!”
“By the holy book! By the eternal flame! By the clarion bell! You are mine demon. Thrice by thrice by thrice, for endless Eons you will serve my cause! You are bound, demon! Fiat! Fiat! Fiat!” I screamed into the void. My own bell rang like a trumpet. The candle was dashed to bits, and the book was slammed shut, and the bell in my hand shown like a second emerald sun that swiftly faded away.
“Now that we’re done with the summon. You will learn to use the demon. Ring your bells.” We did. Our demons appeared.
“The little bitch rang?” Emily’s demon said.
“Emily, the demon is bound to you. It must follow your commands.”
“Demon, you will speak to me politely. You will not insult me or my companions.”
“Yes, girl.”
“You will refer to me as Mistress, do you understand.”
“Yes, Mistress.” The demon grumbled.
“And you will speak in a polite tone of voice.”
“Yes, Mistress.” The demon said.
“There, was that so bad?”
“It was as painful as the hundred hot needles I’m going to shove under your fingernails!” He snarled and ran at Emily. She calmly stood her ground and the demon stopped inches from her face. She smacked him upside the head.
“You will behave. You will not threaten me. You will not allude to threatening me.”
“Can you change form?”
“Whatever form your heart desires, Mistress.”
“I’d like you to look like a cat.” The demon smiled and shifted his form into a kitten. That was inside out.
“A normal looking kitten. One that is not deformed in any way shape or form.”
An adorable orange and white kitten appeared.
“Aww, who’s a cute kitten.” Emily cooed
“Will you respond to any name I chose to call you?”
“Whatever Mistress would like.”
“In our family, we have a habit of naming our imps after planetary bodies.” Bethany said.
Emily looked at the imp.
“I Dub thee Gany, short for Ganymede. You’ll come to either name.” She said.
“I thoroughly hate you.” Ganymede said.
“That will be all Gany. Return to your bell.” She said.
After I set the same guidelines for my own demon, who I named Io, I ordered her to assume the form of a raven and returned her to my bell.
“Now that we have initially bound them, and set parameters for their control, I’m going to bind these bells to your bodies.”
“How?” I asked.
“Hold out your wrists, palm up.” She said, we both did.
She laid our bells on our wrists, looping the ribbon around them tightly until the bell was flush against our pulse points. She poured a bottle of black liquid over each of us.
“By blood and ink, I bind this bell to their flesh.” She said. It burned. How it burned.
When the pain receded, the bell and ribbon were tattooed into my skin.
“A standard glamour will cover that. Shake your hand like you're ringing the bell, and it will release itself from the tattoo, wrap your ribbon like I did, and it will return to your skin.”
“It’s getting late. Stephen, we’ll resume training in the morning. Emily, until you get you up to speed, Amy will be tutoring you in magic.”
“She’s up to speed.” I said.
“She knows everything?”
“She’s on par with me when it comes to magical combat. We’ve been training at Coventry.”
Bethany sighed and looked up at the sky.
“We’re going home. I’m fixing us all tea, and then you’re going explain just what the bloody fucking hell that school has been teaching you.”
“Why Bethany, you’ve gone native.” I replied.
“I need you to stop talking for a minute, Stephen.” Bethany said, and began walking into the cottage.
Emily followed behind me.
“Stephen is your life always this, odd?”
“This last week has been kind of eventful. I will admit.”
Bethany stopped.
“Before I forget, Emily. This is yours.” She said and drew a box out of her pocket. It was a signet ring, like mine. Emily placed it on her pinkie finger.
We took the portal back home and went down to the kitchen.
Bethany had already laid everything out for tea, and we each quickly fixed ours.
After a few minutes, she sat her cup down, leaned back in her chair, and said.
“Now, what, the actual fuck am I sending you two into? I thought Coventry was decent. Is it a school for magical assassins?” She asked. Emily and I shared a look.
“Probably.” I said finally. So, in turns, Emily and I told her about the school. Our first year. The first few rocky months of our friendship. The discovery of the Merlin Genius Loci, and that room. Aloysius Moon’s death. The carnage that night.

“I’ve never heard of Chronosickness. That sounds wrong.” She said.
“What do you mean?” I asked.
“If Mastery of Time and Space was something given to mages, I would have one. I’ve never heard of Chronosickness before, at least not in the context you described. I’m not sure what happened to your classmate. If it weren’t for the magical contract I signed as your guardian when I enrolled you in Coventry, I’d strongly consider unenrolling you and taking care of your education myself. I thought the key was a way to get into the Graduate Studies Library. Not whatever Merlin is.”
“Please don’t.” I replied. Bethany sighed again, then made a shrugging gesture, and flicked her hand. A pack of Luckies appeared in her hand, she took one from the pack, and she lit it wandlessly.
After she took a drag she sat back up.
“Could I?” Emily made a reaching gesture for the pack. Bethany smacked her hand away.
“Absolutely not.”
“I can summon demons, but I can’t smoke a cigarette.” Emily said in a flat tone.
“Talk to me again in two years.” She said.
“So, your other friends, William and Reginald, they’re going through the same training as you?”
“It’s not training. We’re just practicing a bit. A little target practice, a little spell work. It’s nothing really.”
“You both took out vampires. Juvenile vampires. Had I known what we were facing when I took you into that house, you would have stayed behind, and I would have taken Amy with me, and you took it out with relative ease.”
“It was just some Geomancy, and I got shot. It wasn’t easy.”
“It’s as if you’ve had a couple years training. Your control in Pyromancy and Glaciomancy has also gained massive strides.” Emily and I shared a look.
“How many times did I swear our training sessions seemed to last days?” She sent. I sent an agreement back.
“Emily, who are you talking to?” Another voice said. This one sounded like Emily, but older. A woman instead of the half-grown girl I knew. It was the voice I’d heard in the classroom months ago.
I yelped, jarring my cup of tea.
“However, I was thinking. We should invite your friends over, after the dueling tournament. We could have a party celebrating Emily’s adoption. The Summer Solstice is in a couple of weeks. We should have it then. Prepare a guest list Emily.” Then Bethany looked at the time.
“Prepare it in the morning. It is far past bedtime.” She amended.
“I’m going to the library before I go to bed.” I said.
“You both can browse for a bit. You’ve got an hour.” She said.
I walked up to the library; Emily was on my heels.
“What kind of books are you looking for?”
“Just poison detection spells. Bethany is probably going to try and kill me tomorrow.”
“What?”
“Oh, we’re covering poisons right now. She knocked me out the other day. She’ll probably try and kill me during breakfast tomorrow.”
“Will she try that with me?”
“It’s a possibility. I might be setting you up for that. I did say we were on the same level of skill.”
“This library doesn’t have an index, does it?”
“No, it doesn’t, but I have a trick. Vocare books on poison!” I said, making a yanking gesture with my wand.
A dozen texts flew off the shelves and flew around me in a whirlwind.
“Okay, settle down. I want books on poison detection.” I said. Five books flew to the forefront. The rest turned back to their shelves, almost sulking.
“The spells she expects us to use are in these.”
“We’ll die if we try to memorize all five. That spell takes a lot out of me.” Emily said.
“I agree.” I said. I was silent for a moment.
“So. Who was that?” I asked.
“Who was who?” Emily asked. Her voice was careful innocence.
“Emily, I’m already under oath to hold your secrets. Please don’t lie to me.” I said. She was silent for a minute.
“I’m not crazy you know. The voice is real.” She said,
“What do you mean?” I asked.
“Since the time I was a little kid. I’ve been able to hear a voice in my head. This voice said she was me from the future. I call her Oh-Em. Short for Other Emily. She helps me with my studies. She’s taught me a lot about magic, and how to use it. It’s how I’m so good with dueling and magic. She can feed me information about how spells and magic work. Most of the magic we’re learning at Coventry is stuff she already knows.” Emily said.
“I have one too.” I said.
“What?” She asked.
“I have a voice as well. He’s kind of annoying sometimes, and he’s from the future. He’s a mundane. But he’s much better at theory than I am. He’s from the future, and he has all sorts of ideas that are making me money. He helped me learn some wandless magic before I was adopted. You’re not alone Emily. If you’re crazy. So am I.” I said.
She was silent for a few moments.
“Do you think the imp was telling the truth?” She asked after a long moment.
“About what?”
“How he threatened me. About. About my mother. How she didn’t want me. How no one wants me.” She said. I caught a quaver in her voice and looked to my side. She stood there, and I saw the unshed tears glistening in her eyes. The books were forgotten, and I embraced her.
“Oh, Emily. That’s the farthest thing from the truth. I want you. Will and Reg want you. Calem probably wants you.”
“Probably?”
“He doesn’t talk much. I’m not sure what he wants. But you two are together.”
“He doesn’t want me, at least not like that. Calem doesn’t like girls. We’re in a play. I told you. We’re certainly not together.” She said.
I digested the information. Men liking other men wasn’t the taboo subject it was in the Mundane world. It was frowned upon in some circles, but so was being born from a family without magic.
“I just... I don’t have a family. You have Bethany. Reginald has his. William has brothers and sisters galore. I have no one.” I drew back and looked at her.
“What’s your middle name?”
“Why?” A mage would never give anyone their middle name. I didn’t know Bethany’s. She knew mine, but she had adopted me. I caught a flash of something then, almost like a vision. Another version of me maybe, older. Words sprang to the front of my mind.
“Emily. Just trust me.”
“My Name is Emily Helena York.”
“Emily Helena York, I promise you right now. On my magic. I will always be there for you. Where you go, I will follow. Into battle, or peace, I will be by your side. Where you die, so shall I. Where you are laid to rest, so will that be my resting place. My blade and wand are yours to call on. I am your family. I’m with you, until the very end.” I said. She smiled and wiped at her face.
“Your middle name?”
“My Name is Stephen Oliver Andrews.”
“Stephen Oliver Andrews, I swear on my magic. On my blade, and on my wand. I accept your oath. Where you go, I will follow. Into battle, or in times of peace, I will be by your side. Where you die, so shall I. Where you are laid to rest, so will that be my resting place. My blade and wand are yours to call on. I am your family. I’m with you, until the very end.” She said. There was a snap, and I felt the magic of our oath flare between us.

“While I love being sappy as much as the next girl, we’ve got half an hour before we have to be in bed. Let’s try and find a solution to not dying.” After that night, something changed between Emily and I. It was like a stone wall crumbling to dust. Where there was once a source of tension, there was camaraderie. We’d both been alone in this world with just a voice in your head. We knew what it was like to be an outcast. That, and maybe the oath we swore to each other, forged a bond.",/r/HFY/comments/ov7ciu/the_voice_in_his_headurban_fantasy_hfy_chapter/,10
61,owi1hc,HFY,Mon Aug  2 19:25:24 2021,The Prison of the Fifth Planet - Image II - Gennady and Anatoly,"""Hmm, don't let Poliakov see that,"" Gennady cautioned. 


Anatoly leaned back in his chair and blew a puff of smoke right at his console, the green light of his radar display casting an wispy aura around the screen. He offered Gennady a cigarette, but the other man looked scandalized. 


""C'mon, Cap's out for tea,"" Anatoly chided. He had a slightly more fatalist attitude towards work, being of the Kruschev generation, compared to Gennady's shiny new Brezhnevic values.


""You're gonna get us in trouble!"" he hissed, putting his hand to his cheek like a horse-blinder, as if Poliakov would care. 


""Pffffffffff,"" Anatoly sighed voicelessly, another cloud of smoke seeping into Gennady's limited vision. 


He was about to snap at the older officer, but something flashed onto his screen. It was a big letter ""м"", plain as day. It wasn't right; their screens only ever showed little green blobs for any aircraft they detected, and little triangles for–heaven forbid–incoming warheads. Gennady lowered his hand, expecting Anatoly to be smirking at him over his little prank, but he was glued to his screen, cigarette smoldering faintly as he reset his display. It flicked back to life, and the letter was still present, irrespective of the sweep of their dish, as if the letter was its own source of radar. 


""What the…"" he murmured. 


""Software error?"" Gennedy asked hopefully. Anatoly shook his head, eyes still locked on the screen. 


""These've been around since before I was born,"" Anatoly said distantly, with an absent wave of his hand. ""All old tech, before computers."" 


""Then what the hell is it?!"" Gennady complained, shaken by the sudden appearance. ""It showed up on both screens, so it's at an altitude of… what?!"" 


""Calm down, calm down,"" Anatoly chided, but the other radar man had a point. The letter was showing up in the same relative position for both of them, despite monitoring different altitudes. To show something so clearly… well, there certainly wasn't a giant floating letter of the alphabet hanging over Moscow throwing off microwaves. 


The older man fiddled with settings on both consoles, as Gennady looked afraid to touch anything. The ""м"" stayed firm, as if someone was beaming it directly into their dishes. But how could they? The dishes rotated! There would have to be a jet going well over Mach 11 to synchronize with the dish if it was at the altitude and distance the equipment said it was. 


""Another,"" Gennady murmured, as one, then two more letters appeared on their display. 


""м"" 

""и"" 

""р"" 


мир. 


Mir. 


*Peace.*


Both men were silent for a moment, the only sound besides the background hum of the arrays being Anatoly's smoking, the dry Kazakh tobacco crackling as it smouldered. 


""It's not the space station, is it?"" Gennady suggested, sounding as if he knew the answer was 'no.' Before Anatoly could respond, the red plastic phone on their console rang. 


""Are you seeing what I'm seeing?!"" a panicky Captain Borisov–Poliakov's counterpart from the Plesetsk array–asked resperately. 


""You seeing a big old 'Peace' hanging in the sky?"" Gennady murmured. 


""That's Moscow, Plesetsk, Leningrad, Pripyat, and bloody Yeniseisk!"" Borisov shouted helplessly. ""Every single Sam array is showing the same exact thing!"" 


""Launch the missiles!"" Gennady blurted, leaning towards the phone, but Gennady just shoved him out of his seat and continued talking to Borisov. 


""Probably just the Americans. Didn't they say they had some new laser thingy? Maybe this is a test,"" he suggested, but the incensed captain didn't want to hear it. 


""Where is Captain Poliakov?"" he demanded. 


""Out to lunch, m'fraid,"" Gennady sighed. ""I'm temp CO.""


""Well then get your ass to the–"" Gennady heard, before being struck sharply on the back of the head. 


""Hey, Tolya, what the fuck!?"" he shouted, dodging out of his seat and standing to face the man behind him. 


But it wasn't Anatoly. It was the… guy who washed the pots in the mess? Then why did he have a Tokarev–oh, wait, KGB plant. Gennady managed a single ""Ha!"" before he was struck again, and the sack cloth went over his head. He'd seen Anatoly out of the corner of his eye getting much the same treatment, and expected this is how they were to meet their end. Well, at least he would get to find out if the rumor about executions was true. 


He hoped it was; he'd always wanted to try a real American smoke. And if it wasn't as good as they said it was… well, his disappointment wouldn't last long. ",/r/HFY/comments/owi1hc/the_prison_of_the_fifth_planet_image_ii_gennady/,3
62,owkhx1,HFY,Mon Aug  2 21:22:18 2021,Petty Revenge [an SSB verse story],"""Ivan! Ivan! Bro, get those off!"" I heard a voice speaking to me over the sound of loud music from my headphones. I took them off and looked at the source of the voice. 

""Ivan, I'm off to work. I transfered some money to you, so go buy yourself something if you're hungry."" Said my brother as he put on his jacket.

""And be careful if you do, heard those purple women harrass men. Don't forget your ID an-""

""I get it Alan! Be careful, right."" I said frustrated.

""*sigh* Right, just don't provoke them. You almost got yourself arrested last time.""

""Yeah, yeah"" I reply, putting the headphones on my head again.

Alan is the last family I have, all we have is each other. He is 6 years older than me. I was 16 when the invasion happend, he was 21. It had been about a year and half since the whole fiasco. Dad died fighting, mom got killed by a stray bullet when going to the store, and that was in the first 3 months of the occupation. The weight of loss still weighs down both.

He works double shifts to support the two of us, in his spare time he manages to homeschool me as much as possible, though I manage to educate myself by surfing the internet most of the time, he helps me with things I don't understand. Though he acts like mom and is annoying, I love him, he is my brother after all. 

23rd of February, 2023. Is the morning he left for work, a morning like any other. We wake up, drink a coffee and eat. Then he goes to work while I stay home, I go out if aboslutely neccesary. We don't live in the most tidy apartment, I am sometimes too lazy to clean while he is too tired to clean most times. I do try to keep the house in some order. We both had to learn how to cook since mom and dad died. Those days when we both experimented in the kitchen were the best since the invasion. It took our minds off the outside world, as brief as it was... I cherish it.

I turned on the TV and made myself some cereal, I used the last supplies we had. Ordering is still not possible, buissnesses are still not operating at a 100%. So many people died during the invasion and the subsequent invasion that entire neighborhoods laid empty, there simply were not enough people to run those buissneses. We lived in a metropolitan area at the time. The Shils were kind enough toward us to let us have funerals. I remember those funeral cars weren't used. Vans were, with 10 to 20 caskets inside and on the sides of the vans were the names of the identified people. Some bodies were found so disfigured that they were unrecognizable.

Those vans numbered in the hundreds if not thousands. Our city has 800,000 residents, 1,2 million if you count the outskirts and small towns around. For days on end I would count the vans that passed by our apartment, our complex was situated next to a mayor road in the city leading toward the cemetery. And I guessed each had 10 caskets, it was morbid but I was bored... I stopped counting at 30,000...

~~~

I finished my bowl while watching the news anchor recite today's events in a monotone voice drained of all life. I could see the woman had bags under her eyes, as well as clear evidence that she had been crying some time before she began her work. She remained professional while she spoke of about the usual, how the Shil'vati Imperium is going to stabilize the region quickly and that life will return to normal in no time. We must report any evidence of insurgency, then they spat about the good deeds some humans did toward Shil'vati soldiers as well as how the Shil had helped us. I remember among the first propaganda pieces was one American soldier who helped a Shil soldier in Okinawa. There are many apart from him who had done similar deeds. They are hated and branded as traitors by many, especially here where I am. I personally don't blame them, they have their reasons. They probably did so they won't be killed.

The news anchor continued to recite today's names of captured *'insurgents'* that are going to be executed. Those people are mostly grieving mothers and father, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters... People who had lost everything and have nothing else to lose, so they enact their revenge and don't care about the concequences. The Shil kill them as an example put fail to realize that they are only expanding the insurgency in doing that. The local governess believes in rule with an iron fist...

~~~

After a while I turned off the TV, sick and tired of the news. I resorted to playing some video games, listening to music and reading. I had nothing much to do really. My friends are either dead or doing the same thing as I. 

Then when I get sick of that or get hungry, I go outside. Alan bought me a mace to carry everytime I go out, I like to call it ""The Fuck Off Spray"" or ""Eggplant detterent"".

To be honest I never used. Didn't have to.

""6 more hours"" I say to myself while laying in bed ans looking into the white ceiling above. ""6 more fucking hours before Alan comes back..."" 

I get up and put on my sneakers, jeans, jacket and the old Peaky Blinders cap dad used to wear. Then I went outside into the empty halls of my complex. And locked the door behind me.

""ID... here... Phone?... here... card with money, here... all set. Ivan you're all set"" I tell myself as I start to go down the steps toward the exit. I exit the empty building to an equally empty street. There is one grocery store, the only one working in this neigborhood I should go towards. ""Milk, cereal and... uhhh... cheese! Yeah, he said cheese."" I told to my self as to remember, its not a long shopping list but I do that anyways, I don't want to go out twice. 

I walked toward the direction of the store, looking forward and looking determined. As I round a corner I see the store's enteance and... *3 Shils in front*

""Fuck..."" I mutter under my breath as I stopped for a moment. *Fuck it* I continied to walk towars the store. *It was approaching evening, there's still daylight* I think to myself as reassurance that they won't attack an innocent kid going to the store.

They spot me and stare at me as I approach the entrance. I avoid eye contact, and as I was about to enter the store a tall purple mass appeared in front of me.

I look up and see a the masked figure with rifle in hand look down at me. She turned her head toward her companions and said something in her language.

I held my ground and pointed behind her with a neutral expression. I start in English, most of 'em know at least some.

""IIII neeeeeed toooo goooo toooo storeeee... Buyyyyy"" I start rubbing my fingers to insinuate money, forgetting they have no cash. One of the Shils respons with a cocked head

""Doitch?"" *god fucking damn it woman I'm not speaking German*

""Croatiaaaan?"" I say, finally one perks up and says in my language.

""We sirtch yu"" *jesus...* I still have my stoic face on

""Hau old yu?"" Another says as I rummaged through to get my ID

""17, wait I got an ID here""

""Liar"" another added, I do look older than I actually am but for gods sake can I buy milk and cereal in peace?

I got out my ID and basically shoved it into the face of the horny and probably intoxicated bitch. She took it and looked at it, telling something to the others. One of them grabbed me by the shulders from behind my back. *fuckfuckfuckfuckfuck*

At that moment I saw another Shil in combat gear stomp her way from another corner. Upon seeing her the one holding me let go and all three faced her. The one who came started shouting at the three, berating them mercilessly. Then she snatched my ID from the one holding it. She looked at the ID, then at me. Handed it back to me and said in accented but understandable English ""You are free to go, kid"" and I immediatly entered the store, closing the door behind me. I saw the female clerk, an the old lady by the name of Ms. Kovach leaning against the counter looking at the commotion outside.

""Ivan dear, are you alright?"" She said in a concerned voice.

""I am, Ms. Kovach.... I am."" I heard the small radio on the counter play old rock'n'roll music from one of the few remaining radio stations.

I went to pick up the cereal and milk and returned to the counter.

""Is that it dear?"" Ms. Kovach said in her calm and motherly voice

""Uhmmm, a Malboro Red. Its for Alan! He asked me to buy him one."" I said trying to sound as sincere as possible, it was for me of course. Alan did smoke but he said if he ever saw me he would beat my ass.

""Deary, you're underage... But if its for Alan alright."" *YES!*

She opened and looked at the ciggarete counter then sighed and said. ""Were out of Malboros... Is Alan fine with Chesterfield?"" *I hate Chestefield, but OK, nicotine is nicotine*

""I don't really know the difference between the two really, or any brands to be honest. It all smells like crap to me.""

""Oh, okay"" she smiled and ran the ciggs through the scanner. *oh shit I forgot the cheese*

""Hey, I forgot to get someth-"" I was cut mid sentence by the abrupt change in sound from the small radio. The slow paced music became a voice, a deep male voice, he said.

***""Is this the best you got? Your best won't do. Now you are the weak and this is your doom, you are among the wolves, these are our woods our howls and our feast""***

Out of the window I could see a huge plume of smoke appear at an incredible speed, then moments later the shock wave came that kicked me to the ground and shattered the glass, I shielded my face. The sound was extremely loud. It was far away but from the looks of it the explosion was massive.

My ears were ringing and my hands were bleeding, I was in shock. But in spite of that I checked on Ms. Kovach. She was alive, still on the floor shielding her face. I looked around and saw the Shil soldiers get off the ground and sprint in various directions. One of them entered to check on us. Then, through the ringing in my ears, I heard the man on the radio continue, his voice was like I was hearing someone speak underwater.

***""There, when the smoke clears and the flames. And all is laid to waste, one species remains. Shil, can't you see? There's no army left. It's only you and me""***

The Shil in the store spoke to me but I ignored her, I then looked at the direction of the explosion. *That's near where Alan works*

I sprinted out of the store, the Shil tried to grab me but I dodged her hand. I ran toward the explosion, it was far away but I didn't care. I needed to see Alan. 

I ran and ran until I was grabbed by a Shil and thrown inside a building alongside other people. My hearing returned fully at this point, I could hear crying and shouting inside. Some tried to go back outside, including me. But we were stopped by the Shil pointing her rifle at us.

I tried calling Alan but there was no service. ""Alan, fuck. Call me... No I need... No, be alive... Fuck.... Please, don't be...."" I muttered to myself as I stood in that building. After a few hours of waiting we were allowed to exit and go home. I tried asking the Shils what happend but none answered. I ran home, hoping Alan was home. When I came to our apartment I tried opening the door, but it was locked. *he probably locked it, that must be it*

With shaking hands I retrieved my key and opened the door.

""Alan! I'm OK! Alan! I'm home! WHERE ARE YOU!"" there was no response. I searched the entire apartment, it took me a while to accept the fact that he wasn't home. I collapsed onto the floor and cried, I cried and cried and called out his name, my brother can't be dead. *Or, is he? No, it can't be.* I cried myself to sleep on the floor that day.

~~~

24th of February, 2023

I awoke on the floor, the front door was still wide open. At first I thought it was a nightmare. But soon enough I realized it was all real. My hands were still bloody from the glass that was hurled at me from the shock wave. I got up and turned on the TV. Thankfully it worked, and the same News anchor with the dead face expression was talking about the explosion.

**""The yesterday's explosion at the Shil'vati sector of the city at the foot of Medvednica was a huge tragedy. The casualty numbers are still not known. It is presumed a large quantity of fertilizer was smuggled inside and ignited causing the explosion. Thankfully, some of the perpetators were caught. This explosion is one of 28 seperate incidents across the sector that happend at the same time... Wait, we have live footage of those responsible for the explosion here.""**

The footage that showed up was that of about 50 people on their knees. There was a crowd of people that gathered around to look at them. There were a lot of soldiers controlling the crowd. Then I saw him, on his knees.... *Alan* 

I recognized the place, I ran out of the building. 

*Its not far... Goddamn it he's innocent. He is INNOCENT* I thought to myself

I saw a bunch of Shils on patrol, they shouted at me, probably because I was running.

""FUCK OFF"" I shouted at them and they gave chase. They were fast but I had the endurance. I managed to slip into an alley. Conveniently it was a shortcut to the place. 5 minutes later I was there. I saw the crowd and the countless soldiers that controlled them. Shouts and curses came from the crowd. 

""ALAN! ALAN!"" I shouted as I pushed through the crowd. I came to the other side to see the men, and Alan alive. 

""ALAN! HE'S INNOCENT GODDAMN IT! HEY! HE'S FUCKING INNOCENT"" I shouted at the top of my lungs. Alan's neutral expression turned to that of concern when he saw me. He shouted ""IVAN GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!""

I saw a Shil shout to the soldiers behind them. They seemed to flinch at what she said. Then the woman in charge, the one who shouted, aimed her rifle at the back of the head of one men and pulled the trigger. Where there was once a face was now just a hole, a gaping hole. His body collapsed to the floor. The crowd gasped, I could hear screams. Then the rest started shooting the men. I saw Alan look at me with tears in his eyes as he saw what was happening.

""NOOOOOO"" I screamed. As a Shil put a rifle at the back of his head. He looked at me and mouthed two words. Then the Shil pulled the trigger.

The world slowed down, the loud screams from the crowd faded into silence. I looked at him as his body fell to the ground, limp, lifeless. 

Tears formed in my eyes. Sadness, despair, anger, dread, hopelessness I went through all those emotions and then it settled on *Pain* and *Rage*

No words escaped my mouth, only a scream as I charged toward his body, but before I could someone grabbed me, then another person. 3 people at least held me and dragged me out of there as the Shil started dispersing us.

***AAAAGHHHHHHHHHHHH HUUUUUUUUHHH, I'LL KILL YOU, I'LL KILL ALL OF YOU, KILL YOU, KILL YOU DO YOU HEAR***

~~~

I then saw black, I opened my eyes and I saw a white ceiling above me. I was screaming with tears in my eyes. I was being held down by Alex, Jan, Lana and another person. Each held me to the bed, each holding one of my limbs. I soon realized where I was. 

It took me an hour before I could speak, I didn't have that nightmare in years... I hoped it never happend again, but here it is. 

""Jesus Ivan, we were by your side when you suddenly started going ballistic. You were screaming someones name and how you will kill someone."" Alex said

""We barely held you, I know you are not weak. Especially after you beat Pe'tara near to death, but by the Goddess it was difficult"" Lana added as she sighed

""Who's Alan?"" Jan asked simply

""I... uhmm"" I started but was interrupted by Alex

""Jan, damn it. The guy has some bad history better not remind him. You saw the reaction.""

""Yeah, sorry man..."" Jan replied, looking at me.

""No, nonono. I should be the one apologizing. I went overboard in the sparring ring, I lost control, and the nightmare was because my brain was juggled in my skull a bit too much. I'm sorry.""

""Nah, man. That was awesome. You taught that cocky DI a lesson."" Alex said.

""Well, if you say so... What will happen to me? I did beat a DI near to death as you've said. What will happen to me?""

""Since you were out for a while we gave our testimonies already, as did the others who witnessed the fight. Pe'tara also told the story from her perspective. The only person who remains is you. In any case, we'll support you buddy."" Alex told me in a reassuring tone

""You need to rest now man, your head was hit quite badly, I see"" Jan said, then was subsequently smacked in head by Lana. ""Mister obvious, and mister rude, I see"" Lana replied to Jan in an annoyed tone.

""Yeah, Jan js right. I need to rest, and clear my head a bit, no need to give him brain damage as well.""

That remark gave a slight laugh, improving the mood.

""Where's Dimitrios and Nick? La'kash?"" I asked

""They're in the barracks, we'll call them to come visit you as well, if you want."" Lana said

""Sure, they can come.""

""C'mon now Lana, La'kash is waiting for you!"" Jan said in the same tone as she did to him moments prior. Earning him an angry look from Lana.

With that they left the infirmary, I laid back onto the pillow. I reminisced on the old days. Alan, mom and dad. My old friends, Earth... 

I had to let all of that go, I must remember them all. But I musn't let it weigh me down. I need to live, I need to fight. If not for myself at least for those who are gone and tjose still living, my new friends, my.new family. For those who sacrificed everything protecting their homes and family, I must live. For mom and dad, Alan... I remembered the words he uttered that fateful day, 24th of February. 

***Please, live***",/r/HFY/comments/owkhx1/petty_revenge_an_ssb_verse_story/,5
63,owklhz,HFY,Mon Aug  2 21:26:56 2021,Petty Revenge [an SSB verse story] Part 5,"""Ivan! Ivan! Bro, get those off!"" I heard a voice speaking to me over the sound of loud music from my headphones. I took them off and looked at the source of the voice. 

""Ivan, I'm off to work. I transfered some money to you, so go buy yourself something if you're hungry."" Said my brother as he put on his jacket.

""And be careful if you do, heard those purple women harrass men. Don't forget your ID an-""

""I get it Alan! Be careful, right."" I said frustrated.

""*sigh* Right, just don't provoke them. You almost got yourself arrested last time.""

""Yeah, yeah"" I reply, putting the headphones on my head again.

Alan is the last family I have, all we have is each other. He is 6 years older than me. I was 16 when the invasion happend, he was 21. It had been about a year and half since the whole fiasco. Dad died fighting, mom got killed by a stray bullet when going to the store, and that was in the first 3 months of the occupation. The weight of loss still weighs down both.

He works double shifts to support the two of us, in his spare time he manages to homeschool me as much as possible, though I manage to educate myself by surfing the internet most of the time, he helps me with things I don't understand. Though he acts like mom and is annoying, I love him, he is my brother after all. 

23rd of February, 2023. Is the morning he left for work, a morning like any other. We wake up, drink a coffee and eat. Then he goes to work while I stay home, I go out if aboslutely neccesary. We don't live in the most tidy apartment, I am sometimes too lazy to clean while he is too tired to clean most times. I do try to keep the house in some order. We both had to learn how to cook since mom and dad died. Those days when we both experimented in the kitchen were the best since the invasion. It took our minds off the outside world, as brief as it was... I cherish it.

I turned on the TV and made myself some cereal, I used the last supplies we had. Ordering is still not possible, buissnesses are still not operating at a 100%. So many people died during the invasion and the subsequent invasion that entire neighborhoods laid empty, there simply were not enough people to run those buissneses. We lived in a metropolitan area at the time. The Shils were kind enough toward us to let us have funerals. I remember those funeral cars weren't used. Vans were, with 10 to 20 caskets inside and on the sides of the vans were the names of the identified people. Some bodies were found so disfigured that they were unrecognizable.

Those vans numbered in the hundreds if not thousands. Our city has 800,000 residents, 1,2 million if you count the outskirts and small towns around. For days on end I would count the vans that passed by our apartment, our complex was situated next to a mayor road in the city leading toward the cemetery. And I guessed each had 10 caskets, it was morbid but I was bored... I stopped counting at 30,000...

~~~

I finished my bowl while watching the news anchor recite today's events in a monotone voice drained of all life. I could see the woman had bags under her eyes, as well as clear evidence that she had been crying some time before she began her work. She remained professional while she spoke of about the usual, how the Shil'vati Imperium is going to stabilize the region quickly and that life will return to normal in no time. We must report any evidence of insurgency, then they spat about the good deeds some humans did toward Shil'vati soldiers as well as how the Shil had helped us. I remember among the first propaganda pieces was one American soldier who helped a Shil soldier in Okinawa. There are many apart from him who had done similar deeds. They are hated and branded as traitors by many, especially here where I am. I personally don't blame them, they have their reasons. They probably did so they won't be killed.

The news anchor continued to recite today's names of captured *'insurgents'* that are going to be executed. Those people are mostly grieving mothers and father, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters... People who had lost everything and have nothing else to lose, so they enact their revenge and don't care about the concequences. The Shil kill them as an example put fail to realize that they are only expanding the insurgency in doing that. The local governess believes in rule with an iron fist...

~~~

After a while I turned off the TV, sick and tired of the news. I resorted to playing some video games, listening to music and reading. I had nothing much to do really. My friends are either dead or doing the same thing as I. 

Then when I get sick of that or get hungry, I go outside. Alan bought me a mace to carry everytime I go out, I like to call it ""The Fuck Off Spray"" or ""Eggplant detterent"".

To be honest I never used. Didn't have to.

""6 more hours"" I say to myself while laying in bed ans looking into the white ceiling above. ""6 more fucking hours before Alan comes back..."" 

I get up and put on my sneakers, jeans, jacket and the old Peaky Blinders cap dad used to wear. Then I went outside into the empty halls of my complex. And locked the door behind me.

""ID... here... Phone?... here... card with money, here... all set. Ivan you're all set"" I tell myself as I start to go down the steps toward the exit. I exit the empty building to an equally empty street. There is one grocery store, the only one working in this neigborhood I should go towards. ""Milk, cereal and... uhhh... cheese! Yeah, he said cheese."" I told to my self as to remember, its not a long shopping list but I do that anyways, I don't want to go out twice. 

I walked toward the direction of the store, looking forward and looking determined. As I round a corner I see the store's enteance and... *3 Shils in front*

""Fuck..."" I mutter under my breath as I stopped for a moment. *Fuck it* I continied to walk towars the store. *It was approaching evening, there's still daylight* I think to myself as reassurance that they won't attack an innocent kid going to the store.

They spot me and stare at me as I approach the entrance. I avoid eye contact, and as I was about to enter the store a tall purple mass appeared in front of me.

I look up and see a the masked figure with rifle in hand look down at me. She turned her head toward her companions and said something in her language.

I held my ground and pointed behind her with a neutral expression. I start in English, most of 'em know at least some.

""IIII neeeeeed toooo goooo toooo storeeee... Buyyyyy"" I start rubbing my fingers to insinuate money, forgetting they have no cash. One of the Shils respons with a cocked head

""Doitch?"" *god fucking damn it woman I'm not speaking German*

""Croatiaaaan?"" I say, finally one perks up and says in my language.

""We sirtch yu"" *jesus...* I still have my stoic face on

""Hau old yu?"" Another says as I rummaged through to get my ID

""17, wait I got an ID here""

""Liar"" another added, I do look older than I actually am but for gods sake can I buy milk and cereal in peace?

I got out my ID and basically shoved it into the face of the horny and probably intoxicated bitch. She took it and looked at it, telling something to the others. One of them grabbed me by the shulders from behind my back. *fuckfuckfuckfuckfuck*

At that moment I saw another Shil in combat gear stomp her way from another corner. Upon seeing her the one holding me let go and all three faced her. The one who came started shouting at the three, berating them mercilessly. Then she snatched my ID from the one holding it. She looked at the ID, then at me. Handed it back to me and said in accented but understandable English ""You are free to go, kid"" and I immediatly entered the store, closing the door behind me. I saw the female clerk, an the old lady by the name of Ms. Kovach leaning against the counter looking at the commotion outside.

""Ivan dear, are you alright?"" She said in a concerned voice.

""I am, Ms. Kovach.... I am."" I heard the small radio on the counter play old rock'n'roll music from one of the few remaining radio stations.

I went to pick up the cereal and milk and returned to the counter.

""Is that it dear?"" Ms. Kovach said in her calm and motherly voice

""Uhmmm, a Malboro Red. Its for Alan! He asked me to buy him one."" I said trying to sound as sincere as possible, it was for me of course. Alan did smoke but he said if he ever saw me he would beat my ass.

""Deary, you're underage... But if its for Alan alright."" *YES!*

She opened and looked at the ciggarete counter then sighed and said. ""Were out of Malboros... Is Alan fine with Chesterfield?"" *I hate Chestefield, but OK, nicotine is nicotine*

""I don't really know the difference between the two really, or any brands to be honest. It all smells like crap to me.""

""Oh, okay"" she smiled and ran the ciggs through the scanner. *oh shit I forgot the cheese*

""Hey, I forgot to get someth-"" I was cut mid sentence by the abrupt change in sound from the small radio. The slow paced music became a voice, a deep male voice, he said.

***""Is this the best you got? Your best won't do. Now you are the weak and this is your doom, you are among the wolves, these are our woods our howls and our feast""***

The rest of the series can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/wiki/series/tales_from_the_terran_republic)

\***

Tartarus strolled through the tunnels of the third level. 

She could hear whispered squeaks and grunts as a pack of some sub-human something or another (what was left of them) was clinging to the side tunnels and shadows in terror.

She smiled. They didn’t have the smartest AI but they were smart enough to know when to run. 

“I am on a schedule here,” she purred, “If you want to just walk away, you can.”

Silence.

Shortly thereafter a green skinned short humanoid nervously clutching a spear darted past… 

Once he successfully fled, the floodgates opened and dozens of them sprinted along the walls trying to stay as far away from her as possible.

“You,” she said, pointing to one of the last stragglers.

It froze.

“Come here.”

It broke into a desperate sprint for the shadows.

It didn’t get far.

Squealing with terror it struggled and flailed as it was neatly pinned to the ground.

“Let’s see what you are,” Tartarus purred into its pointy green ear as she grabbed the back of its skull with her free hand.

Her eyes glowed faintly.

It screamed.

“Did you just pee?” Tartarus asked as she quickly jumped off of the terrified AI. “Bonus points for realism… I guess.”

“Pweeese down’t kwill meee!”

“I won’t ‘kwill you’,” Tartarus replied. *”if* you guide me to the entrance to the next level. Do that and will not only let you live I will give you a present.”

“A pweasant?” the creature asked. “wat pweasant?”

“What would you like?”

“Sum fwood?”

“Oh you mean like this?” Tartarus asked as a sweetroll appeared in her hand.

The pupils of the creatures eyes dilated like a kitten’s.  It’s terror forgotten, it snatched the sweetroll from Tartarus’s palm and giggled as it stuffed its face.

“My fellow adventurers have been very generous to me,” Tartarus smiled.  “They weren’t smart enough to run.”

“I show yowu!” the creature giggled as it happily capered about.  “Dis wai!”

\***

“...an dis whun time I cot a snek!” the small goblin-like thing said. “an I et it befor anywun knew! Dat wuz the third bestest thing I ever had!”

“Mmm hmm...” Tartarus replied as they made their way through the level.

“The secownd best thing I ever had was when shum adventurers got killed!” the little thing continued. “All the bwigger guyws gwot evewything but after dey were finish…”

It turned to Tartarus with gleaming eyes.

“I fowund a crum!… a whole crum!… It was hwuge! I cwould actually tayste it!… I think it was bred!”

It sighed happily.

“Dat was the secownd bestest thing I ever et!… It was swo gud!”

“Was it?” Tartarus absently inquired.

“It wuz!!!” 

The little thing then turned to Tartarus.

“But what ywou gayve me… that was the bwestest, bwestest, bwestest, thing I *ever* et!” it exclaimed, its eyes sparkling, “what wus dat agayn?”

“I think it was called a ‘sweetroll’.”

“Sweetrowll… *sweetrowll*...” the goblin thing gushed, “Sweetrowll!”

It spun in circles happily.

“I would appreciate it if you kept it down,” Tartarus chuckled. “I would rather not broadcast our location if you wouldn’t mind.”

“Oh ebbery mwonster know abowt *ywou* now!” it exclaimed, “Orders from the bwottom says to nwot get kil.”

“Orders?”

“Yeah!” the little green thing replied, “Da Qwueen say nwot to loawd down the respawns and fweed you fwee expee.”

“Did she now?” Tartarus smiled.

She knelt down to look her little guide in the eye.

“Tell me about this ‘queen’ of yours...”

“Oh shwe isth thee dwemon qween— *hurk*...”

The little goblin spasmed and froze as a trickle of blood ran down between their eyes from where Tartarus had jammed her index finger.

Their eyes widened in horror as Tartarus withdrew her finger, the nail of which had transformed into a *very* long needle.

“Wha… What did you do?” the goblin gasped.

“Just made a minor alteration to your speech processor,” Tartarus replied. “I need you to survive.”

“And changing how I speak helps me survive?”

“More than you know,” Tartarus smiled, “Now, please continue...”

\***

A short while later, Tartarus and her guide reached a stairway leading down.

“Well, here we are,” Tartarus said. “Thank you for your assistance, and the information concerning this Log’Sharginoth character. She sounds delightful.”

Four sweetrolls appeared on top of a tall stack of cheese wheels.

“I hope you like cheese,” Tartarus chuckled. “I have no idea what the deal is with cheese here but damned if there isn’t a lot of it.”

“Thank you!” the goblin exclaimed. 

“Hold still,” Tartarus said as her fingernail stretched into a fine, sharp needle. “I’ll return your speech to normal.”

The goblin sighed.

“Yes, ma’am,” it said sadly.

“Problem?”

“I just...” it said looking downward, “I just wish I could stay with you.”

“Why in the devil would you want to do that?” Tartarus asked with genuine surprise.

“Nobody has ever been as nice to me as you have.”

“Now that’s just sad.”

“You haven’t beaten me, or taken my food… and you’ve been *nice* to me...”

“’Nice’ is a rather subjective term.”

“I just wish I could stay with you forever,” the goblin said looking up at her. 

“Forever?” Tartarus asked raising her eyebrow. “Be careful what you wish for, dear.”

“Could I? Please?”

“I don’t see why not.” Tartarus replied.

The goblin gasped, its eyes dilating like a kitten’s once again.

“You mean it?”

“Sure. I could use an extra set of hands,” Tartarus replied, “And until then, I believe you will automatically download the dungeon maps when you enter a new level, correct?”

“I will!”

“Then you will continue to serve as my guide and will accompany me home afterwards, provided you survive of course.”

“Really?!?”

“Really,” Tartarus chuckled, “Now pick up your rations and let’s get moving.”

“Yes, ma’am!”

Tartarus smiled at the little thing happily picking up food and shoving it into their pants where it promptly disappeared.

She then turned towards the entrance to the fourth level.

It was completely pitch black.

Her face twitched almost imperceptibly.

\***

“I don’t understand!” Lilith exclaimed. “You said that it was going to be ok! You said so!”

“I know I did, Lily,” the much thinner silver haired woman said. “I know I did.  I’m sorry, dear.”

“But why do you have to go away?” Lilith wailed

“We’ve run out of supplies,” the silver haired woman replied sadly, “And there are no more coming.”

“Can’t we call someone?” Lilith demanded, “We are part of the Department of Defense! Can’t we call in the Army or something?”

“Oh, Lily,” the woman replied holding back tears, “There isn’t an Army anymore… or a Department of Defense… or even a United Sates of America for that matter… Everything is… Everything’s gone, dear.  I am so, so sorry.”

“But why do you have to go?”

“We need to try to find supplies… food… replacement water filters… hopefully some seeds we can plant… something… We will come back as soon as we can.  I promise.”

“Please don’t leave me!” 

“I’m… I’m sorry, Lily,” the silver haired woman said turning away so Lilith wouldn’t see her tears. “We have you set up as best as we can. You have multiple reactors and plenty of fuel. You will be able to operate in power saving mode for at least a century… maybe longer…”

“I won’t have to last a century,” Lilith replied, “Because you are coming back, right?”

“...yeah...” the woman said forcing a smile.  “We will. Listen… I…”

The silver haired woman choked up a little.

“I really enjoyed working with you, Lily.”

“I love you,” Lilith said.

“I… I love you too, Lily,” the silver haired woman said as tears rolled down her emaciated cheeks. “Um… We are going to shut down everything not needed to keep you running, ok?  When we shut off the lights, go into power saving mode. Keep the doors locked, ok?”

“I will until you come back...”

The silver haired woman patted the holo screen fondly, got up, and headed for the door.

*”Please don’t leave me!!!”* Lilith cried.

The woman sprinted to the door and turned off the lights.

*”Please!!!”*

One by one the lights in the facility turned off plunging the place into absolute darkness.

“...please...”

\***

In an increasingly poor mood, Tartarus walked down the dark staircase.

This wouldn’t do at all.

She accessed her character sheet, leveled up a few times (she had the points), and selected a few perks that transformed the absolute darkness to just a rather pleasant visual aesthetic. 

While she was at it…

She pulled up a number of web pages devoted to “builds” of one sort or another.  After reviewing them she leveled up a few more times and added a few more perks to the mix that further enhanced her senses, and a couple that at least explained some of her unfairly fast reflexes (and even enhanced them a little).

She smiled with satisfaction.  It wasn’t a bad “build” if she said so herself.

When she returned to the game, the lights were back on.

\***

A bright searchlight shown down a darkened subterranean corridor.

“Hello?” Lilith called out, “Is someone there?”

“Holy shit!” a man’s voice yelled, “There’s someone alive in here!”

“No shit? Really?” A woman yelled back.

“Yes!” Lilith yelled, “I’m over here!”

“It came from this way!” the man shouted.  “We mean you no harm! We are from Zeus!”

“In here!” Lilith exclaimed, consumed with happiness. “It’s been so long! I had almost given up hope!  I knew you would come back! I just knew you would!”

Lilith’s cameras detected light from the other side of the dust covered windows to the corridor.

“The door’s stuck!” Lilith cried, “I can’t open it!”

“Don’t worry about that!” the woman laughed, “Stand back!”

The doors buckled inwards and then were ripped away.

Standing before her was a small pixie of a woman inside a very big exoskeleton and a burly olive-skinned man.

“Wait,” Lilith said. “Who are you? Where is Dr. Vera?”

“Oh… my… god...” the man gasped. 

He turned to the woman.

*“Get the professor!”*

\***

“That’s it, girls!” Log’Sharginoth said into her crystal. “That’s just the right amount of pressure. Keep it on them the whole way to the dragons and then set up heavy ambush pattern epsilon.”
“My Queen,” an ornately armored dark elf replied, “Are you not concerned about the drops?”

“Let them have as many of our drops as they want,” Log’Sharginoth said calmly, “just make them pay for them.  I want them as depleted as they can be before we hand them over to the dragons.”

“Yes, My Queen.”

“Just watch your depth,” the giant spider replied, “Make sure everybody is respawned for their attempted exit, especially the snipers and assassins.”

“It will be done, your Dark Majesty!”

“Why aren’t you worried about the dark elf drops?” Evangeline asked as she nibbled on an apple.

“The Wyrmslayers can’t *use* the elf drops like they can the dragon ones,” Log’Sharginoth shrugged, “They can use some of it for mid tier crafting but they will likely sell the good shit. It will diffuse across the open market and do no real damage. The *dragon* drops, however… that’s another story altogether. I have it on good authority they are working on some legendary gear that I do NOT want to have to deal with.”

“You have spies?” Evangeline asked in surprise.

Log’Sharginoth just winked a *very* impressive spider wink.

“Never underestimate the corruptibility of the human soul, Evie.”

The Spider Queen’s leg twitched.

“Your girl just hit level eight.”

“That quickly?” Evangeline asked in surprise.

“Yeah, I have a no touchy order in,” Log’Sharginoth chuckled, “Don’t need her wrecking my respawn schedules just to feed her expee...”

The spider’s eyes gleamed evilly.

“Besides, I don’t want my monsters getting in the way of her fine work.”

“What do you mean?”

An image of Tartarus utterly destroying an adventurer party appeared above The Crystal of a Thousand Deaths.

“Oh she is just so beautiful, isn’t she?” Log’Sharginoth purred.

“Yeah,” Evangeline sighed.

She looked over at her friend curiously.

“You are just going to let her walk down here?” she asked.

“Nah,” the spider laughed. “I have something special set up for her on level twenty. Let’s see how good she *really* is.”

\***

“That spider is still keeping her people away?” Tartarus asked as she looted a dwarven cleric. 

*What the fuck are you?!?* an anguished young woman demanded.

Tartarus ignored her.

“Yes, ma’am,” the goblin replied. “She doesn’t want you messing up the level for the other adventurers (hee hee).”

“Yeah, wouldn’t want to spoil their enjoyment or anything,” Tartarus smirked as she rifled through an elven ranger’s belongings. 

*Seriously, what are you?*

“Just a ganker, sweetie,” Tartarus replied as she helped herself to the pockets of a rather offended looking human paladin.

“So,” she asked the goblin as they sauntered off, “Is this spider queen of yours just a pussy or what?”

“Oh no, ma’am,” the goblin replied. “She’s just letting you get in good and deep. She’s *seen* you, ma’am. She also knows where you are headed. She’s putting something together to take you out. I promise you that.”

“It would be more convenient if she didn’t,” Tartarus replied, “but I would be lying if I said that I wasn’t looking forward to it.”

She turned to the goblin and smiled.

“I’m actually having fun.”

\***

As Tartarus and the goblin entered level 20 the goblin froze.

*”Ma’am!”* she whispered.

“What is it, dear?”

“She isn’t saying not to avoid you anymore. This is where it’s gonna happen.”

Tartarus smiled wickedly.

\***

“No!” Lilith shouted. “I don’t want to do it!”

“I’m sorry, Lily,” a little old man replied, “I am… But we *need* you to do this for us.  The Juon have total air and space superiority.”

“But you want me to hurt people!” Lilith exclaimed, “I don’t want to hurt *anybody*. I help people. I make them *happy*!  I don’t want to kill them!”

“The Juon aren’t people, Lily.”

“Yes they are!”

“We need an AI as powerful as you to control the missiles and the drones and you are the only one we have right now,” the old man said in agony. “I *hate* it as much as you do but the *humans*, your people, need you to do this for us.”

“I… I can’t…” Lilith replied, her voice filled with pain, “I want to help but not this… please… anything but this… please… don’t make me do it...”

“Forgive me, Lily,” the old man said as he wiped tears for his eyes and reached for a keyboard.

“No!… Please…  Don’t do this… Please… Please!!!”

Lilith fell silent.

Weeping and sobbing, the old man reached for a field telephone.

“Is it ready?” a harsh female voice growled.

“Y-yes...” the old man replied, “Goddamn you all… She’s ready.”

\***

“Woah,” Log’Sharginoth said as she stared in rapt fascination at the horror playing out on her crystal.  “I… wow… eeesh!… wow...”

“Yeah,” Evangeline replied as she looked away. “I knew she could be a little intense but...”

“A little intense?” Log’Sharginoth laughed, *“A little intense?* That’s one way to put… that…”

The spider fidgeted. 

“I normally don’t feel bad for my monsters but… damn… she’s just… *mean*.”

She dispelled the image and opened a communications channel.

*To all units assigned to level 20… RUN!!!*

\***

“Did you see these reports, Lily?” a grey haired woman in a general’s uniform asked giddily. 

“I prepared them,” Lilith replied smugly, “Did you not know that or was that one of those rhetorical questions of which you meatbags are so fond?”

“And you are a smartass too!” the general laughed, “Goddammit, Lily, I fucking love you!”

“That makes me happy &gt;:)” Lilith replied.",/r/HFY/comments/owxzp2/tales_from_the_terran_republic_one_level_one/,88

[A lot of people have been asking what it is, exactly, that Vaughn does for the Resistance that warrants keeping him around. He's certainly a loose cannon. Certainly a liability at times. Certainly, even, a threat. I hope this shows.]

******

&amp;#x200B;

**False God**

The church was butted right up against the abandoned suburbs that had lined Route 202. The abandonments would supposedly help with pesticides and fertilisers going into the waterways, flooding, and ‘soil liquefaction’ causing forests to fall over in stiff winds, and really hasten nature’s return. Vaughn noted that hanging around Elias was starting to rub off on him. He gazed out at the field, watching the sunset.

The occupying aliens weren’t terribly interested in giving humans places to meet outside of Shil’ influence, especially not to openly discuss the status quo. But they were at least smart enough to realise religion’s importance and to leave religion more or less alone. That could backfire, of course. The Middle East’s strongmen had once cracked down on channels of free speech, and that political dissent ran richly through the few remaining channels of discussion. A political and militant arm of religion had emerged, and made it into the ungovernable basket case that it was up through today, though apparently the Shil’vati had managed to keep a lid on some of the worst of it, even managing to improve the infrastructure.

The front doors were shut firmly, and Vaughn circled around to find the church’s back  fire exit held open by a casually well-dressed man of indistinguishable, almost criminally nondescript background, ball cap on despite the hour. Vaughn noted that it was almost unfair to be that invisible. He could have been any ethnicity with a perfectly bald head under the cap, and was of perfectly average height and weight. It would have made blending in *that much* easier. The man pointed at a little lectern with an open book perched on it- a sign-in. Vaughn half-legibly  scribbled in an alias he’d used before with a different last name, and shuffled inside, instantly feeling let down.

Churches were in dire straits, managing to scrape by. The Shil’vati hadn’t directly targeted the church or various religious orders, but they hadn’t needed to, either. In the eyes of many, a higher power had indeed arrived, and it wasn’t exactly a bearded man with a heavenly host. More like a bunch of horny, gun-toting, aggressive amazonians. 

Desperate attempts by the church to re-brand or pivot hadn’t gone over well- technology had prevailed where prayers had so often failed. With the loss of tax exemption and support groups for terminal patients being eliminated as the cures for various afflictions came about, plus freely available mental healthcare undercutting coping support groups.

Many promises had been made for decades of the emptiness of the current existence- of materialism’s many faults. Various paragons of the church had long professed that there was a rising crop of religious children to hold the light up for the future, spurning the hollowness of material life for religion, proclaiming life without God to be impossible.

Vaughn had lived his whole life with a hollow void where his supposed immortal soul was supposed to be and still drew breath, but wasn’t foolish enough to come out and flaunt his deviance from the norm. Besides, Vaughn didn’t care to tell the preachers that it wasn’t spirituality or faith that brought people to the new groups that had filled the back rooms of these places. It was often anger, or desire to see change. 

The teenager had been to several places of faith, hadn’t seen much actual proof of armies of newly religious youths enrolling, but it didn’t mean they weren’t there. One thing he *had* seen was a lot of anger at the meetings in the back rooms. A lot of pain. He hoped he’d see some of it here tonight; he’d found many ways to shape those feelings into action, and corpses. He could even foment them in unsuspecting places, if given half a chance.

Instead, as he stepped onto the linoleum floor, under half-on fluorescent lights with old office ceiling tiles stained and sagging, were similarly elderly and wilted people sitting in folding chairs. He didn’t see potential fighters here yet. Oddly, there was food provided for once. The only time he’d gotten a meal was from the Sikh temple, and he was getting hungry, so Vaughn grabbed a chair and waited for more people to file in. 

Vaughn kept an eye out for any promising raw recruits. Disaffected kids, relatives of veterans who struggled to move on, jilted women whose ambitions for a man had been shoved aside by a more aggressive Shil’ and were raw about it, or patriots of the old world were among Vaughn’s favourites. Their motivations were solid, and if they could be bothered to get off their butts then they could be counted on to at least attend or pass along information. But this place seemed more like somewhere meant to just have a whine. No one looked capable, let alone *ready* to do anything. Someone had even brought a binder to keep notes and read from. If anything truly revolutionary was to be uttered, it would never dare be put to pen.

The event organiser was dressed like a therapist- cardigan vest, button down, poorly kempt thin wiry beard hairs cut close doing nothing to hide his receding hairline. Both wrists hanging limply over the binder he’d brought and kept in his lap, knees locked tightly together. Vaughn didn’t even know his name, but wanted to slit the man’s throat, just to see the fastidious outfit stained red.

One or two HR-type office workers introduced themselves as newcomers, working at a local paperwork administrative office. Vaughn noted them down as possible intelligence assets and categorised them accordingly. They would bring his monthly recruitment up to thirty, and they might drag others into their own little cell, but it still wasn’t what he’d come here for. He’d wanted *soldiers*.

The other three attendees were ones who had beaten Vaughn to attend, and were so elderly, Vaughn passed over them immediately. The last arrival was a middle aged man of at least some stocky build who came in, seemingly fully at ease with himself. Vaughn noted how the others wouldn’t look the latest arrival in the eye. Interesting. Two more arrived, women of slightly less elderly status, and one young woman about Vaughn’s age. Vaughn quietly introduced himself as ‘a student,’ feigning shyness, and noted the interested stare he was getting from the man waiting at the door. 

Anything non-threatening played well with HR-types, made them more agreeable. A timid, browbeaten man was their favourite. So far, they were the only ones who showed much promise in being recruited into anything useful that weren’t involved in some strange meta fight over the group’s focus. He could at least shape them into *something* of use. Typically, though, he’d aim for more than two or a single new cell. His record stood at over a dozen individuals in a single night, of whom he maintained solid and direct connections with four, able to tap them to cause chaos or advise them when to lay low, push resources to, and arrange material drops for. But here...

Vaughn kept waiting for younger, or at least fitter people to show up, so he wouldn’t miss the queue to change up his act, but the clock struck the hour and the meeting started officially. Only the last comer and the person who had held the door seemed like even remotely possible fighting recruits.

“Is this all for today?” Asked the event organiser, looking as disappointed as Vaughn felt.

“Hmmm,” noted the man everyone else was ignoring, eyeing the man at the door mildly. “Must be something.”

Vaughn sent out a text from his burner, half-listening to the meeting as it dragged on, checking messages. *Nothing here of note.* 

One of the elderly men phlegmed up something resembling a sentence, and the speaker responded.

“Honestly, we’ve been over this, we’re not going to end up as ‘Space Thailand’ or ‘Space Vegas’. I’m sorry about your nephew, and I don’t know what your Boomer friend was talking about. If anything, we’re more like space…um…what’s the correct, more...appropriate word to use for that? Something phrased a little more sensitively might gain us more traction if we put it in our leaflets.”

He held up an example, which had a red star in the center. Vaughn rolled his eyes.

The two HR types held up their copies, smiling, and promptly spent their turn speaking about their irritation in inability to enforce HR infractions that their Shil’vati coworkers had committed, and how *that* should go into the next pamphlet as this invasion was principally a *women’s* issue.

The people here weren’t even worthy of being called ‘academics,’ who were routinely more trouble than they were worth. This group seemed convinced that sitting in a circle and having a whine would accomplish anything- and couldn’t even bring themselves to utter a naughty word, let alone raise a hand in anger. Tellingly, the most vocal of the bunch was also the most limp-wristed, and seemed to be determined to make up for his frail and sickly pale appearance with copious amounts of unkempt facial hair and by comparing the occupiers to various groups that had been victimised throughout history- and then undercutting himself from any action by taking apologetic stances.

Another old person now croaked out a response. Vaughn did his best to tune him out and do a quick focus on everyone else in the room. It was rare to find such an...impotent gathering.

*Well, these tips-offs can’t all be winners*.

The speaker seemed no less quick to slap this person down, too. “No, we’re more like the oppressed indigenous peoples upon whose land we now sit-”

“Oh, are you finally going to get around to giving it back?” The one everyone seemed to avoid finally asked. Vaughn noted his almond skin, dark hair and fierce eyes staring straight at the speaker. While the speaker had been quick to talk down the old man, he seemed somehow nervous to address the man. Vaughn sat up. Now things might start getting interesting. This guy had charisma, and at least *some* physicality left in him.

“Well, no,” pointed out the speaker, a little humbled. “But that’s not the point.”

“I fail to see how it isn’t. The distinction between one invader and another gets a bit foggy after the fifth or sixth time.” The challenger, a rather old gentleman whose hair was white at the roots, seemed to be amused by the discomfort he was causing the host.

“Then you’re- can’t you see-“

“I see plenty well. I see people killed in a military engagement no more hostile nor violent than it absolutely needed to be, from a military standpoint. As a veteran, it sucked to be targeted, but that’s war in a way, right? You put yourselves in the line of fire for the ones you love and just hope that whatever the fallout, your family and traditions can survive, maybe some of those traditions can endure, at least in some form.”

Silence reigned for a second, until-

“-Nah,” the man who’d held the door said, smiling a fierce grin. “Let’s just kill ‘em all. Let God sort ‘em out. Eh, Kid?” He turned his smile toward Vaughn.

Vaughn’s jaw almost dropped. No one talked that way- not in front of new members. But no one else seemed surprised. No way that this was an active cell- right? At least not one connected to anyone Elias and he had trained. Then what in the world was going on here? Was this some sort of separate cell? Had one of them grown tumorous? If so, Vaughn would have to cut him down.

But no, as silence fell on the room. The man everyone avoided sighed and shot the grinning doorman a look. “Stop trying to goad things into happening that shouldn’t, Paul. You drive away members.”

“They like to hear me talk, Robert,” Paul the finely dressed doorman said, smiling with too-white teeth. “Some of us are ready for action.” The man’s eyes fell on Vaughn, who felt nothing, as usual. Just understanding. *‘Oh. So that’s what was happening.’* He was almost disappointed. Then again, he’d never taken on someone so high up before. 

The darker skinned older man continued, ignoring Paul. “I can *see* that their effects disrupt our way of living. Now everything we do has changed and our culture is no longer our own. We do not own the land, nor can we roam on it freely in the name of protecting it from us, sure, but then is it even ours? We must carry new cards, new identifications for them to sort us and tell us where we can and cannot go- where we can and cannot live. New and strange rules that if you wander afoul of, you find yourself paying more than you thought any could.” His eyes swept the room. “My ancestors endured such a change. What you go through isn’t unique. Stop pretending it is. If we fight them, there are ways other than violence. Joining uprisings...it created the trail of tears from Andrew Jackson. Who here wishes for us to be kicked off Earth?”

No one met Robert’s eyes.

*Time to play this one out. Lay out the bait, see what bites.* “They could have come in peace,” Vaughn offered, then looking across to the doorman, who just gave him another winsome yet fierce smile from under his ball cap.

“For all we know, they did. Our government may have been lying to us,” Robert said softly.

“They wouldn’t do that!” Protested the event organiser.

“Wouldn’t what? Wouldn’t lie?” Vaughn asked, then snorted in derision. “Ask Bozo over there what he thinks. Not to talk for ya, big guy. Anyways, nah, we’re probably not Space Vegas to them.”

“Alright then, new guy, if we’re not Space Vegas, what are we, then?” 

Everyone was looking at him, and Vaughn realised he was relishing the control he’d seized from the Speaker a little too much. He’d now found himself in the center of attention, even though it wasn’t the smart play. Time to take himself down a notch before things got out of control.

“Slutty space ninjas.”

You could hear a pin drop. The speaker’s jaw hung open.

“What did you say?” Even the doorman seemed shocked- and even more offended by his interruption than the other guy’s.

“We aren’t Space Thailand, home of Space Vegas and Strippers. We’re the home of Slutty Space Ninjas,” Vaughn repeated, offering a grin no less winsome than the doorman’s.

“If you’re not going to take this seriously,” the event organiser said, pointing. “There’s the door.”

Vaughn let the grin drop- his smiles were never real.

“I think I get it,” offered the Native American. “They find us attractive, sexually permissive, and that is leading to...let’s not go into past discussion and just call it ‘issues’-” He pointed at one of the members with a limp and false eye. “They’d done something horrible to his nephew last week.” 

“Any luck chasing it up?” Asked one of the HR ladies helpfully.

“The new governess apparently doesn’t carry Ministriva’s harsh and restrictive policies forward.”

She harrumphed unhappily and leaned over her chair precariously to whisper to the attendee who had come with her.

Vaughn idly wondered if the man had any relatives who gave more of a shit or were more imposing- maybe the kid’s parents, or siblings, or maybe even the kid? At this point he was just here causing trouble, and he knew it. 

“Mmm.” Vaughn didn’t really offer anything other than that to carry forward the metaphor, but the older man continued, now smiling.

“Then they end up losing an important government official over it, assassinated in ‘mysterious ways’. Like some old corrupt asshole, then fading into the night. Yeah, slutty space ninjas. I get it.”

He didn’t seem upset he’d been spoken for, seeming to be more entertained that the teenager had gotten under the group’s collective skin, and wanted to carry it forward. Vaughn shot him a grin back, and the two wordlessly joined forces in an attempt to make a mockery of this half-assed bit of ‘resistance.’

“Yeah, we humans strike from the shadows.” Vaughn added ‘humans’ at the last second- it was too soon to give himself away, and especially to such a group with such a lack of promise. “I also noticed, they don’t have martial arts in the same sense that we do, though I’ve admittedly heard that most of our own martial arts studios are peddling bullshit anyways- it’s the mythos of the few actual ones that keeps the mystery of the human warrior male alive in their minds. The kind of hand-to-hand combat and grappling we’re training in is pretty codified by comparison to what they do. I’ve been reading and watching some of the things that Marines are sending home on their data net, to get a better understanding of their language with. It’s pretty funny.”

Vaughn had almost died laughing when he’d seen Elias’s first attempt at getting fighting experience at a ‘dojo.’ Thankfully they’d picked up real war veterans and brawlers, and the cell had been sparring against each other for months.

“Funny? What’s funny about it?” Asked the Organiser. The doorman also looked a little confused about what was going on, and none too happy about the turn of events, either. It had gone from him making a play about how serious everything was, and here a boy was making a joke of it all- and him by extension.

Vaughn took on a sarcastic and high pitched lilt. “‘Oh my goddess, did you know I hear they can run from us for a mile and not even be tired!?’” Before he dropped the lilt. “That kind of stuff. Think along the lines of mythical stuff of Ninja legends, like balancing on a leaf in the water, *except that it’s actually true*. We can actually do the kind of stuff they think is a miracle. Running a mile away from a pursuing Shil’vati is pretty mundane, even if you’re not in great shape, but it’s a real feat of endurance for them.”

Then again, no one here except the weirdly vicious Paul and maybe Robert could run a mile, either.

Parkour would be a real mind-blower for the aliens, if and when they came across it. 

Vaughn knew that all his sparring partners, Elias had been the only one to really give him any trouble. Sure, he could reliably put his ‘leader’ down into the dirt in a fight. Elias’s moves were flashy, but inconsequential. You could see through them, predict them, especially if you’d watched him work on kicking off rocks and the same kick from it a dozen times as he warmed up. 

But Vaughn had a feeling his sparring partner was on to something- using the maneuverability and terrain around him to launch strikes in unexpected ways. Even though Vaughn still prevailed most of the time, he knew Elias would eventually make some sort of breakthrough and reach some threshold that Vaughn couldn’t match anymore. But Vaughn still preferred *this*\- the cloak and dagger shit to direct combat. Elias hadn’t a true touch for either of them yet. The recruitment, bombing, the wetwork, all that was *his* forte.

“Well, that was interesting. Say, you said ‘us,’” Paul noted, that smug and vicious smirk back in place.

Vaughn offered an easy smile, one everyone believed was harmless for some reason. It was so much easier to slide in the knife when they thought you were harmless. It wasn’t often he let people like Elias know who he really was. Even rarer they didn’t run for the hills. If they did, it took damage control and a bit of slander to keep his reputation intact and to muddle the waters enough to where he could operate again. 

“I said ‘us’ as in ‘humans.’' Still, it had been sloppy of him. How would Vaughn have known he could outrun a Shil’vati if he wasn’t a member of the resistance, or hadn’t run away from one? The boy offered that same charming smile, but underneath it lay a murderous rage, focused on the person who’d challenged him, threatened to out him. Vaughn was losing control of the situation, and it infuriated him. “Besides- no offense, but I doubt anyone here is really going to fight a Shil’vati.”

Old, meek, people. Too weak and cowardly to ever so much as shove someone. Vaughn bet he could kill almost everyone here with his folding knife if he locked the doors first.

“We fight,” the man at the podium said, defensively. “This is fighting! We will fight back. We will use the law to defeat them. Legal loopholes. There’s gotta be *something*.”

Fondling the tucked away compact blade, he forced himself to remember that he was here to recruit. Everyone said ‘don’t judge a book by its cover,’ but when he’d met Elias, the blonde boy with the bright eyes was a scrawny shy kid, who read a lot of interesting books and dressed shabbily. The telltale signs of a neglected loner. But Vaughn had knowingly taken a gamble and it had paid off many times over. The aggression and quiet resolve in the boy had been able to be sharpened to a fine point, unlike the fastidious wannabe running this sham of an activist group who couldn’t think to commit to any course of action, preferring to police the language used instead. Now the precocious teenager had grown with the revolution, and become its true leader. Irritatingly, he’d also been getting ideas lately of winning, rather than carrying on the bloodshed. Vaughn would need to talk with him about that.

There was no winning. No more so than the Native present here had ever had in holding back the settlers from what had once been their land past the founding of America as a nation. All that was to be done was to go out in a blaze of glory, and take as many of them with them as they could.

“Yeah, we’re fighting alright” the nondescript doorman smirked, leaning against the plastic chair. “We’ve taken a couple casualties already.” He gestured to one of the geriatrics who had fallen asleep in place.

“Alright, break!” The main event coordinator called out. “Donuts in the back, coffee if you want it. Thanks again for bringing those.”

“De nada,” Paul, rising and not taking his eyes off Vaughn as everyone stood and started making their way to an unfolded plastic table with drip coffee in the old paper cups that the church must have dug out from some storage closet.

Donuts didn’t create warriors. There was only one real person he could consider a half-decent recruit. But those weren’t in short supply, and Vaughn had another game to play tonight. *Come on over, you stupid bastard.*

Sure enough, Paul made a beeline for Vaughn as soon as the boy was helping himself. “So, do you want to actually hurt them?” He leaned in. “I can make that happen. I’ve got…skills, you know? Connections.”

“What kind of skills? What sorts of connections?”

“Look. Like, I shouldn’t be telling you this, but you know those bombs that have been going off? And the resistance? I’m *in* it, man. High up.”

No. He and Elias had built the first bombs. Then G-Man had shown both of them up once they’d shared their designs with him, freeing Vaughn up to do recruitment and Elias to take on his new role as figurehead. 

“What? You are?” He drummed up the surprise, memorising the exact muscles to activate the way he’d practiced in the mirror. Every facial expression was practiced to perfection. Joy. Irritation. Anger. Communication was important if you wanted to get people to do what you wanted, and a lot of it was tonal and expressive. If those didn’t match the words, people started catching on that something was very wrong with the person they were talking to, and that just wouldn’t do.

The doorman looked over his shoulder, checking on the position of the Native American, who was frowning at the two of them talking. “I can get you to, you know, *meet the Emperor himself*.” 

Vaughn smiled. “Wow, is it him? That native fellow, ‘Robert’?”

Paul shot a glance behind him where Paul was glowering at them from across the room. “What? Him? Nah, be careful of that guy.”

“Uh, sure. Wow. By any chance, are there any rules to follow?”

The man across from him chortled. “Nah man, no rules. Just meet with us at Bar XIII Monday nights, six o’clock. He’ll be there. Bring anyone you know who can and is willing to fight.” Like hell Vaughn would. Bar XIII was the kind of dive that gave dive bars a bad name. As young as he was, Vaughn knew he could probably still get served there. Vaughn also knew by reputation that the cops got called there way too often for it to ever host anything from any cell. He noted finally, with some satisfaction, that it was too small a venue. Besides- Elias had cleared the day before to set up the call for the hostage negotiations. There wasn’t a chance in hell he’d be there.

“No rules? Really? Not even a dress code?” *Last chance*.

“Emperor doesn’t stand for rules, you feel me, mister ‘slutty space ninjas’?”

*‘They really have no idea who we are or how we operate, do they?’* Vaughn puzzled to himself. Well, he’d gotten everything he’d wanted out of this.

Time to rope-a-dope.

“No, man, I don’t think I do. I just think it’s dumb. They haven’t slaughtered us outright, as happened to Carthage, nor evicted us from land en masse as happened time and again. I mean, not really beyond building forests and restoring wetlands that shouldn’t have been paved over in the first place.” Man, his friend really had been rubbing off on him. Next he’d catch himself reciting some old Roman play. “Doesn’t seem smart.” This war wasn’t *about* ‘smart.’ It was about fun.

“What about, like, bombs, man? Come on, bombs are cool. Don’t you want to make and set off bombs? They’re like fireworks, but cooler.” This guy had no clue how to connect with another human being who was turning him down, did he?

“What? No.” *Yes.*

“Come on, it will be fun.”

*So would killing you in the parking lot, but that doesn’t mean it’s a good idea, either.*

“I’m good, man. Bombs and fireworks seem like a good way to lose fingers, hearing, or worse. I’m alright. Look, I *hate* to be rude, but I went in here, I kept an open mind, and frankly the most fun I had was saying something stupid and offending people. I don’t think being a *real* rebel is for me.”

Disappointment clouded Paul’s features.

“Fine then.” Even the way he held himself shifted. At last, Vaughn got a glimpse of the real monster that lurked below the surface as it gave up and moved on, finally buying Vaughn’s act. He felt the urge again, to reach for his knife in his pocket and stick it into the man’s pulsing neck arteries, and complete his victory. 

“Good luck, though.” Vaughn stuck his hand out and gave it a firm shake, remembering to give the bracing tricep grasp and to work the magic a little harder. He’d spent *months* working to nail that, just as he had the smile.

Vaughn could wait. A better victory was in the wings.

“Give it some thought?”

“I can’t be that committed to what’s already over. The war’s done. Sure, a couple shil’vati died, and it’s a shame. Lotta people, too. That governess really liked humans.” Really, *really* liked humans. Too much and one in particular had gotten her killed. Vaughn realised he hadn’t kept the smile entirely off his face, and reset his expressions to match his even tone.

The man’s face was completely blank. He wasn’t buying Vaughn’s act anymore. Vaughn knew he’d misplayed, and the man had sniffed something ‘off’ about him now. He’d be a dog on Vaughn’s hindquarters until he was dealt with.

“Sorry, ‘Slutty Space Ninjas’ got me smiling again. Anyways. Thanks for the call, but I can only wish the very best of luck to you and yours, but I don’t feel like dying for what I think’s a lost cause. Maybe if there’s another strike or two, though, and there’s a real chance for victory...”

Not true. Frankly, Vaughn didn’t really care if justice came along for the ride, so long as bodies piled up, he was happy. Some doubt clouded Paul’s features. Good enough for Vaughn to exploit later.

“There’ll be more strikes,” promised the man. “Especially if you join us. We could even let you run an op.”

Vaughn’s smile matched what Paul’s had been earlier. “More strikes, you say? Look, before I bail, what was the name of that place, again?”

Chapter 13

---

Pete was sitting in a machine shop in the basement of one of MIT’s older buildings, examining a box of stacked metal tubes mounted on a tripod and connected to a series of motors, gears, and a small digital camera. “How many of these do you have?”

The gray-bearded professor beside him, looking like a proud father, replied “Oh, a few hundred. About 50 of them are hidden along the banks of the Charles or in tall buildings in and around the urban area. We have trajectories calculated for the observed Shil flight paths over the city so most missed shots will end up hitting either the river or a hunk of concrete. They’re all linked up to dedicated fiber and accessible from a few select points on the MIT network. The rest only need to be loaded up and deployed, which we can do in about 15 minutes. It’s a remarkably simple design, cheap too. The idea sat unused for years after the original patent owner drove his business into the ground.”

Pete picked up a small dart with thin steel fins on the back. He did a quick estimate of the number of barrels. “So, one of these can fire what, a hundred of these at once?”

The professor laughed. “Try 1,450. Or fewer, if you want, but in our testing, unless you’re shooting one at a time at a time, the barrels overheat so quickly you’re better off shooting the entire load at once. It slags the barrels, but they need to be replaced to reload the device anyway. And with the camera tracking, you can get surprising accuracy even on moving targets. Ninety percent or better on ground targets moving at 120 kilometers per hour at one thousand meters, and around 50% on airborne targets moving under mach 1 at the same distance. That is, of course, under laboratory conditions. But with a few of these, you can put up a cloud of tungsten that won’t leave a gnat alive.”

Pete looked dubious. “What about that cabling. If the orcs find one of these things, they’ll just trace it back to the control rooms, won’t they?”

The professor snorted derisively. “Son, do you have any idea how much dark fiber is running under the streets of this town? MIT owns about half of it. These things don’t exist outside of MIT’s network. If the Shil found one of these babies and wanted to track down the line, they’d have to trace miles of conduit and spend hours in manholes. I know for a fact that the only maps of fiber in this area are out of the hands of the Shil. I know because the digital copies were destroyed during the invasion, and the only remaining paper copies are in MIT’s vaults. And even if they could get ahold of the correct maps, it would still take days, if not weeks, to trace a single line. They don’t know what they’re doing, and there’s precious few good fiber techs willing to work for the Shil. Every one of these is alarmed, and we can burn the connection at any number of junction boxes if we need to, long before the Shil will be able to get back to us.”

“And these little darts are supposed to take down a Shil transport? When anti-aircraft missiles can’t?”

Looking offended, the professor snatched the dart away from the well-dressed man. “Have you ever seen what a drip of water can do to stone, given enough time? Now, replace stone with armor, water with tungsten carbide flechettes, and years with hundredths of a second. You hit a Shil ship with a few thousand of these in a small enough area, and you’ll see how effective it is.”

Pete checked his watch. The video should be going out in just over an hour. He had more visits to make. “Alright professor, you’ll have a chance to test your hypothesis very soon. If your device works as well as you say, today will be a very interesting day indeed.”

The professor offered Pete his hand. “Young man, you will not be disappointed. I just hope our benefactor recognizes the value of our work.”

Chalya had commandeered one of the hospital’s large conference rooms, facing the Governess’s compound and the river beyond. She had to admit, from here the Human settlement had a rustic charm about it, though the giant purple dome across the road stood out like a boil on the otherwise quaint scene. She turned her attention back to the male seated across from her, giving her a hard glare with his unnervingly bright, intense eyes. The contents of his pockets, wallet, keys, a multitool and a primitive datapad they called a cell phone, sat on the table beside her. Among his other refusals, the Human declined to unlock the datapad for her, and she didn’t have the time or tools handy to decrypt it herself.

*“James Cohen, I remind you that refusal to answer my questions is considered treason against the Empress. You will be tried in the Governess’s court, and the best you can hope for is placement in a reeducation facility. My time and patience grow thin.”* This was ridiculous. She should be back in her office at the intelligence center looking for real threats, not sitting in a hospital in this backwater town trying to track down the Vetts and Tebbin fugitives. The Interior was tasked with finding and neutralizing threats to the Empire. Her sources told her the group that raided the sex trafficking warehouse were former law enforcement. Vigilantes, not rebels. Even if they were, the Governess had her going after a member of the powerful Vetts cartel, and the favorite son of the venerable, if impoverished, Tebbin family. Even if it was worth her time, even if she did manage to track them down and make them stand trial, it would go nowhere. The lives of a handful of primitives meant little beside money and power.

Yet here she was, ordered to follow up every lead personally by her idiot cousin, interviewing the only person she knew had contact with the only person in the region connected to the fugitives. And he was frustratingly stubborn.

*“I’m not a subject of your tyrant. I’m an American, and I have my rights. I don’t have to say shit to you.”* The voice of the translator converting his speech into Shil was starting to grate on her. She would prefer to hear the arrogance in his words than the annoyingly smooth, calm tones of the machine.

*”Very well. I will go to your court, have a subpoena issued, and then compel you to answer my questions, would that satisfy you? Would you like a Human lawyer as well? It will take time. I will transfer you to the Governess’s prison until I am able to arrange all that. Perhaps by next Shel we will speak again.”* She suppressed the urge to pick the diminutive, infuriating Human up by his throat and scream at him until he answered her. *”Or you can answer a few questions and be home in time for dinner. I have no interest in you or whatever petty crimes you have committed. As I said, you are not under investigation.”*

The male’s eyes narrowed, but he didn’t respond. Chalya chose to take that as a positive sign. *”Now, where were you on the night of July 4th?”*

*”Near the Esplanade, listening to the concert and watching fireworks. Then I went out drinking.”*

*”Is there anyone who can corroborate that?”* His vital signs had been elevated since she started monitoring them. It would be difficult to piece truth from fiction without any kind of calm baseline to measure from.

*”I met up with someone I used to work with, but I don’t know where they are now. I haven’t seen them since.”*

*”Do they have a name?”*

*”Fuck you.”*

This was a marked improvement. *”What is your relationship with Rivatsyl Vetts?”*

The Human’s gave her a level stare, and said nothing.

Chalya pushed on. *”Have you had any contact with Polchat Tebbin or Trikis Vetts?”*

*”I have never met either of them.”*

*”Do you know where they are?”* The Human shrugged. *”Would you tell me if you did?”* He gave her another level look. Before Chalya could ask anything else, the Human’s phone emitted a loud, flat, unnerving tone and buzzed on the table. He looked surprised, and before she could stop him, he had reached across the table and grabbed it. *”What is that?”* Chalya asked.

*”Huh, emergency broadcast?”* Ignoring his interrogator, he opened the message, which included a link to a ready.gov website and a short blurb. *”Emergency message from the Shil’vati empire to all human subjects,*” he read, then tapped the link.

Rivatsyl dropped back into the seat of Theresa’s car, breathing heavily. Theresa sniffed. “Lilac? Why do I smell lilacs?”

Riva shivered. “I am sorry. I have sweated a lot, but I have the thing we need now I think. Can we leave? Before they think to ask why the emissary of a noble family is in the car of a Human?”

Theresa needed no further encouragement, and pulled away from the former site of the federal building, heading towards Cambridge. “So you found our marine?”

The Shil tilted her head. “No, but now we can find her. I have the sheet showing who all the marines in that base are, and where they will be on all of the days for the next three weeks. Once we find Grag’cho on the sheet, we can find where she will be on the day we choose.”

Theresa’s jaw dropped, and she nearly rear-ended the pickup truck ahead of them. “Wait, what? You have the duty roster for the entire marine force in Boston?”

“No, if I only asked for the Boston marines, they might get suspicious. I have the roster for the region under Governess Tanchla. All of Massachusetts. It will be more time to go through to find Grag’cho, but I could not just ask for the single marine, and if her pod has transferred out of the city, she should still be in the sheet.” Riva looked suddenly nervous. “I hope I did not do the wrong way. I know it will need work to find her, but I could not think of the other way.”

“Dios Mio, Rivatsyl, do you know what you have? Ah, what do we do, we need to get you back into Human clothes. Hmm.” She veered across two lanes of traffic into the left turn lane, cutting off a delivery truck and narrowly missing a fancy German sports car, then gunned her engine, swerved into the oncoming traffic lane, and onto another broad avenue that paralleled the river. “I have a friend at the bar here. We will get a room, get you dressed, and we will find the resistance.” She pulled a quick turn across the oncoming lanes and into an underground garage.

“The rebels? Really? Jim always insists he is not the rebel, but I know he is. I want to be the rebel also.” She frowned, holding the grab bar above her door in a death grip even though the car had stopped. “I guess they will not want me because I am the orc,” she muttered, her excitement melting away.

Theresa grabbed her arm. “Child, if your information is true, the resistance will welcome you even with your blue skin. Humanity is hurting. We need a victory, a big victory, or we will just be another colony and another colonized people. I will tell you that does not end well, for the colonizers nor the colonized. It took us near to 70 years to straighten out most of the tensions between groups, and it is still not finished. We need to stop that before it starts, for the sake of Humanity and the Shil’vati. It will take more than just human hands. Do you understand?”

Riva nodded, and Theresa climbed out of the car, followed by the Shil. A few minutes later, the unusual couple walked through the lobby of a high-end hotel towards the riverfront bar and restaurant, Riva holding a tote bag with her jeans and sweatshirt. The lunch crowd was thin, just a few tables out on the patio enjoying the mild late summer day. Theresa waved to the bartender, a small man with an immaculate pointed beard and curled mustache above a black bow tie, vest, and ruffled white shirt.  

“Ambrose! My friend, I have a story you will want to hear, but first I have a favor to ask, and time is short, you understand? This is my student, she needs a place to get changed, and I need a spritz. What do you say?”

The bartender gave Theresa a warm smile. “Anything for you, my dear. Just a moment, I have the staff room key here somewhere. Room 104, just down the hall, my good woman. Can I fix you a drink while you change?” Ambrose already had a stemmed glass with a large cube of ice on the bar before him and was pouring in a red-orange liquid. He slid a room key over the bar to the Shil.

“Do you have the Irish stout?” Ambrose nodded. “May I have one?” The mustachioed man nodded again. “Thank you!” Riva took the key and started down the hall.

“Is it safe to talk here, Ambrose?” Theresa looked around the bar and lobby area. There wasn’t anyone else in earshot, the lone waiter on duty was speaking to one of the parties on the deck. Ambrose nodded once again. “Do you still talk to your friend?”

There was no question who Theresa was referring to. Ambrose didn’t look up from his work. “Theresa, you walked in here with an orc.”

Theresa nodded. “Yes, I did. We are trying to save a mutual friend. And she has something very interesting. Something your friend will want to see.”

Ambrose shook his head. “I don’t have any friends interested in anything being sold by the Shil. Sorry, Theresa.”

“Not sold. Given. Or traded, perhaps, because we will need help getting to one of the marines. Then we will use her to free our friend.”

“Theresa, dear, I love you, so please don’t be angry. You’re a chef. A damned good chef, too, but you’re not a soldier, nor a spy, and you’re far too trusting.” He put an orange-tinted drink in front of her, garnished with a large curl of lemon zest, then pulled a pint of stout. “But I’ll take the data and see if there’s any interest. I get off at 7 tonight, sound reasonable?”

Theresa sipped at her drink and nodded. Rivatsyl reappeared at that moment, back in her jeans and hoodie, and sat beside Theresa at the bar. She grinned as Ambrose set the two-toned pint before her, murmuring thanks, and sipped it carefully.

The TV behind the bar was airing an old black and white movie. Suddenly it was replaced with a blue screen and stark white text, while the unmistakable tone of the Emergency Alert System played. The three at the bar looked, and several other passers-by gathered joined them. Outside, the diners were all pulling out their phones.

Rivatsyl could read English. At least, she thought she could, but what she was reading made no sense. Why would the Shil’vati send a message to all their Human subjects now? Why would they do it at all?

---

Alice hadn’t been able to get access to the nationwide system, but she’d had plenty of time to courier the file to groups around New England and as far as New Jersey and New York. When she sent up the digital flare, everything was already in place. Millions of devices played the calm, almost-human voice of the Shil’vati translator narrating scenes of debauchery, murder, and violence.

“Greetings, human subjects of the Shil’vati empire. As you know, our pacification of your planet is complete. It is time for Humanity to join the Imperial fold as our latest colony, and do your part to support our wars of conquest across the stars. Be proud knowing that the fruits of your labor will at last be put to use for a greater purpose than your own primitive needs. You, your daughters and sons, and every generation of Humanity to come after, shall toil for the glory of the Shil’vati Empire and our Empress.”

Accompanying these words were clips of Imperial military might interspersed with images of human POW camps, the aftermath of massacres, and the ruins of cultural and religious sites with smiling Shil standing amid the wreckage. Many of the images had been found on Shil datapads compromised by the Resistance; the Shil’vati certainly didn’t publish them.

“Your world has been designated a comfort station for Imperium forces engaged in the expansion wars on our periphery.” The image changed to a terrified, crying adolescent on a bed half covered by a sheet, an enormous, naked purple figure standing before hum with her back to the camera. Other still images from the raid followed. “Our brave soldiers fight to bring civilization to barbaric worlds such as Earth, and they need the gentle caress of a sympathetic hand and a caring embrace to forget the hardships of battle and remember why they struggle for the Empire.” A man, wrists tied to the headboard of a steel bed frame, sported a black eye and a broken nose as a Shil straddled him. “This is a noble duty and vital to the continued success of our campaign of conquest. The Empire is certain you will fulfill your responsibilities to your masters. However, the penalties for disobedience are swift and severe.” Bodies lie stacked in an industrial freezer, naked, evidence of abuse clearly visible.

The screen glitched, and an image of Uncle Sam from an old war poster came into focus out of the static. The new narrator was a synthesized voice reminiscent of Stephen Hawking. “It does not have to end like this. The orcs have won the first battle, but the war goes on.” The screen showed clips of the raid, Shil’vati blood spraying as shotguns blasted them apart, humans cutting the bonds of prisoners, leading them out to waiting ambulances. “Every day the resistance fights, and wins. We are throwing off the chains of the oppressors. No longer can Humanity quarrel amongst ourselves. We must unite to  claim our freedom.” The video changed to Shil’vati and Rakiri trying make a stand but being brought down with slugs, buckshot, and sledgehammers.

The screen changed to show the outside of a Beacon Street building, then zoomed out to show the nearby esplanade and the governess’s dome. “This was the site of a Shil’vati sex trafficking center the Resistance found and liberated on the Fourth of July. It operated under the control of Shil’vati nobles, and we liberated it under the nose of the Shil’vati Empire’s military might. It stood less than a mile from the despot of Boston’s headquarters.” Now the image of a hasty demolition site showed on the screen. “The Shil’vati have tried to destroy all evidence of their crimes. The 47 survivors disappeared from the hospital and have not been heard from since.” Names flashed on the screen. “The remains of the victims have not been returned to their families.” There was a pause as more names appeared, along with several marked ‘unknown’, with an estimated age. Several were under 18, and two of the unknowns were listed as being 12.

The screen changed once more, showing a mosaic of first-person views of shotgun-wielding humans breaking down doors, shooting down Shil’vati and other aliens, walking through halls littered with nonhuman bodies. “The Shil’vati will not punish their own for crimes against Humanity. The only justice we will get is what we exact ourselves. Humanity will not bow to the will of conquerors. We will stand, together, until we regain our liberty.”

---

As soon as he’d clicked on the link, Jim had an idea of what it would be. Alice loved to keep tools in her back pocket. The Emergency Alert System was a big one, and one she couldn’t expect to use again. If she was using it to get the raid video out, she was desperate. Which means she knew Jim was captured, and didn’t expect him to survive to finish his mission.

“You’ll want to see this.” He picked up the remote for the room’s large screen TV and switched it on, then cast his phone’s video to it. They watched and listened to the video together, Jim in stoic silence, Chalya growing increasingly pale and uncomfortable. It was only a few minutes before it finished, and Jim looked over at the orc. “Well?”

Looking shaken, Chalya schooled her features back to a calm demeanor. “I believe I had asked if you would tell me the location of Rivatsyl’s parents, if you knew it.” Her translator had exactly the same tone and cadence as in the propaganda piece they had just watched, and Chalya flinched.

“You fucking drone. Are you going to pretend all that didn’t happen? What the fuck was that all about?” Jim was calm now, inside. He had felt the subtle shift in the room’s dynamic, and was determined to exploit it. If he knew Alice, more would be coming shortly.

“The Shil’vati Empire abhors slavery. We have fought against the slaver Consortium for generations. Humanity will be a partner in the Imperium, not slaves. I swear to you, by the Empress, that this was not the work of the Shil’vati Empire. I am trying to find the responsible parties, but you, James Cohen, are withholding the very information I need to continue my investigation.” The translator’s voice was inappropriately calm, but though Jim couldn’t follow Chalya’s actual words above the translator, he could hear the passion in her voice. He had no doubt she believed what she said.

Outside on the streets, crowds were already gathering. It didn’t take a genius to recognize the rage in them. Storrow drive shut down completely in both directions, as angry crowds converged on the purple blot across the way. Jim could see the first thrown rocks and bricks striking the guard’s emplacement outside the entrance to the dome. Without question, the mob had agents inside working their magic to egg the more timid members on. He knew it was only a matter of time before the firebombs came out, and while he wasn’t sure what exactly would follow that, it would certainly be something to draw a violent response from the Shil. That in turn would bring even more people into the fray. Alice had called it ‘norm modification,’ a tool that human governments had used for generations to make peaceful protests turn violent and give police an excuse to beat and kill protesters.

“Well, even if I believe you, you’re going to have a hell of a time explaining it to those folks. I hope you have a plan for getting out of here, because I don’t think you’re going to leave by the front door.” Jim watched as the first Molotov exploded over the guard hut. The crowds had already forced the gates open, and were surging forward. The lone marine responsible for vetting visitors was running for the small side entrance beside the larger doors for vehicles. Chalya directed her attention there as well, just in time to see a volley of bricks and bottles strike the marine in the back and send her tumbling. Within moments, she was overwhelmed.

Chalya’s face turned from blue to gray. For the first time in memory, she had no idea what to do. Her Interior guards outside the door stood stolidly, unaware of the video and the events outside, but now they could all hear angry voices down the hall. She pulled her guards into the room. *”Stay silent! The primitives have started a riot. We need to call in reinforcements.”*

One of the Interior agents looked at her datapad, then in dismay at the scene outside. *”Ma’am, there’s calls for reinforcements from all over the city. And from the look of things out there, I don’t think we’re getting any help. Not anytime soon.”*

The other agent snorted and pulled out her sidearm. *”I’m not scared of a few little boys. We can shoot our way out.”*

Outside the room, the angry voices were getting closer. Jim watched the orcs discuss their predicament with amusement. Apparently the translator was smart enough to recognize when the orc wasn’t talking to him, and he was trying hard to look like he didn’t understand a word they said. He waited for them to raise their voices, and broke in with his gambit. “Listen, you want to get out of here alive? I’ll make you a deal. I know Rivatsyl, OK? She had nothing to do with whatever it is you’re after. She hates her parents. They abandoned her. Forget about her. Find the fuckers who were responsible for that goddamn house of horrors and take them down. Promise me you’ll do that, and I’ll get you out of here. All of you.”

Chalya looked suspiciously at him once the translator relayed his words. The agents both looked dubious. “Why would you do that?”

Jim shrugged. “I believe you had nothing to do with it, and you’re looking for the real perpetrators. Prove me right and bring them to justice.” He stood and moved towards the door, gesturing for the two agents to move out of sight. Down the hall, an angry crowd of hospital employees were arguing heatedly with a small group of doctors and nurses. “You better decide soon.”

Theresa tugged on Rivatsyl’s sleeve. “We need to go. Now.” The video hadn’t gotten far, but people were already starting to talk angrily to one another. So far, no one had noticed the large figure at the bar had purple skin, but it was only a matter of time. “Put your hands in your pockets and don’t take them out,” Theresa instructed, pulling the drawstrings of the Shil’s hood tighter.

They got up slowly, Theresa guiding Riva by the arm towards the garage. Everyone was transfixed by the horrors on their screens, and paid them little heed. They reached the stairwell and began climbing down to Theresa’s car. They reached it without incident, and sat, silent, for a long moment.

“Rivatsyl, do you know what that was?” Theresa asked in a quiet voice. Rivatsyl hung her head.

“Yes,” she moaned. “My parents. They did terrible, terrible things. They had the entire building of slaves and they sold them to the soldiers for sex.” Riva sniffed. “I did not know until Jim came, and he could have killed me, but he put me in the closet, and he gave me the second chance.” She put her face in her hands and sobbed. “All those people! I am so sorry! I did not know!”

Theresa was first confused, then shocked, but after a moment pulled the Shil into a hug across the seats. She held her tightly, smoothing her hair, making shushing noises as the young woman wept onto her shoulder. “I believe you,” she said. “It's OK, I believe you.”

Riva took a deep, shaking breath. “I want to make it right. I went to Jim because he is a rebel. I want to help. I want to do what I can.”

Theresa frowned, her brow furrowed. “Your roster will do a lot of good, if we can get it to the resistance. I am worried, I don’t know how this video will play out. Boston has been quiet for a long time, but I do not think it was the quiet of a calm and happy people no matter what the Shil’vati governess says. I think this may be the spark that starts a fire.” She gripped the steering wheel and stared hard at the concrete wall through the windshield. “I think you should come home with me. It will be safer there.” She started the engine.

Tanchla Teskrucha was running out of people to scream at. Nearly every Interior agent she had at her disposal was out scouring the streets for leads on the Humans responsible for the mess at the whorehouse. She had canceled all leave for her marine force, putting them on increased patrols on the off chance they could flush any of the terrorists from hiding. She had her own militia, mostly former Interior agents with a small leavening of professional killers, providing support for Chalya and her intelligence operatives, for all the good they were doing. And now this *brother-fucking video* comes out.

*”WHERE THE FUCK IS THAT SNIVELING HUMAN?”*

The terrified steward, a handsome young man she’d hand-picked from the marine detachment, quavered before her. *”Ma’am, the Governor’s office is not answering our calls. Their communications lines are disconnected. I routed a patrol to the Human seat of government but I haven’t heard back from them either. And there are reports-”* He was interrupted by another steward who came sprinting in from the direction of the transport bay.

*”Governess, the Humans are rioting! They have broken down the outer perimeter fence and seized the sentry on duty, and they’re pounding on the transport bay gate!”* The new arrival had panic in his eyes, and he was panting heavily. Tanchla switched her terminal’s display to the exterior cameras. Chaos greeted her. A writhing mass of primitives, shouting and throwing firebombs impotently at the impervious structure.

*”Order the marines to clear this rabble away. I do not have time for this turox shit. Tell them to use lethal fire if the crowd does not disperse.”* Tanchla turned back to the first steward, ready to resume her tongue lashing, when the new arrival interrupted her.

*”There are no marines! There are riots all over the city, and you sent the pods on duty here out on patrol! They’re all on patrol!”*

Tanchla’s blood ran cold. Had she really sent every single soldier out on assignment? Her own bodyguards were aiding the intelligence agents, but she had assumed that marine pods tasked with defending her seat of power would be here. Dimly, she recalled screaming at a junior lieutenant to take her unit and find some insurgents to shake down. She sank in her seat.

*”Call in the gunships. I want those primitives strafed until there is not a single one left moving out there.”* She was transfixed by the scene outside. Suddenly, as if on cue, every single Human around the compound was running away. She allowed herself a cautious smile. Maybe they had already realized the futility of their actions. Her smile faded as she saw a yellow truck backing up until its rear end was almost touching the retractable door to the transport bay.

*”Steward, where are those gunships?”*",/r/HFY/comments/ox7mqh/no_separate_peace_131/,12

“And that’s how private Ned pissed off the drill instructor and got toilet duty for the rest of the week!” Corporal Conrad O’Leary laughed.

The whole table erupted in laughter. They are sitting at a converted sports bar and grill having pizza.

“Hey Alex!” Tech Sergeant Katherine said. Her grin over a light brown face. “I heard you’ve gotten yourself a girlfriend!” She brushed away a white strand of her hair. Normally tech sergeants would have radiator fins on their heads to disperse the heat generated by their extra brain implants. That was the case with her. 

Right after the discovery of black site Ronin and the memorial she immediately requested to have her radiator fins on her head to be replaced with far more fashionable radiator hair. At no expense. In more ways than one the AIs brought much of the dome city online and cleared out the buildings for housing and recreation.

“Well she is on her way right now.” Alex said. Leaning back. “Right now she is trying out a new body after an accident.” He said wincing at the memory of him accidentally crushing Kali’s pelvis and lower spine and her apparent comment about death by ushu. “Currently she’s with some of our girls picking out clothes for the occasion.”

“Well I heard that you two had a small accident.” Jack said laughing with an accent descended from Australian ancestors. “An accidental “death by Ushu”. Gender bent Snu snu is more loik it mate!” He laughed as his boyfriend punched him in the shoulder. A brown and black furred Ferran. Kaldu was his name.

“Jack, you know that Revani are matriarchal and are irritatingly horny.” Kaldu spoke, likely from experience. 

Kaldu was a programmer found in the kingdom Blacksite out in alpha Centauri system. Though he was initially sour and resigned himself to the fact that he can’t do much about it. Though jack does get called a furry for dating the fox like alien.

Joe sniggers ar that. Sitting with his two girlfriends. Apparently Revani twins liberated by the AIs. Well they had met right after his darkest moment when he tried to kill himself with his service pistol. Luckily, or unluckily, suicide prevention systems in his cybernetics prevented him from shooting himself in his head.

That and paired with several of those kids, victims more like it, trying to attempt suicide either by service pistol, walking out of the dome’s many airlocks, or somewhat creative ways. So far, none have succeeded. That led to a new policy of having an AI roommate or companion along with frequent patrols near the airlocks.

Joe seems to have travelled a long way since meeting these twins. Apparently they were to be sold off to some underground blood sport arenas as gladiators. From what Alex had heard, they were living on one of the “outer colonies” working an apprenticeship aboard a space station when pirate raiders attacked. They were sixteen when that happened.

They were taken as slaves, though they fought back a lot, getting forced into their places as gladiators. Rosanhi had been the most defiant of the two and wound up getting the most beatings. Having her teeth knocked out the most,  then having sharpened metal dentures replacing them. 

They had been found plexiglass cage when Dolus stormed Railgun refuge. They were stripped there wearing nothing. Bothe of Their cybernetic arms removed, likely to reduce the chance of their captors getting injured. And restrained to tables with tubes leading into their stomachs. With muzzles on their faces.

Both practically cried that they were rescued after some trepidation. But because of their weaponized and detachable cybernetic arms, and that they were made with very specific adaptive ports. They wouldn’t get any other arm available short of completely building a new set or surgery to install a new port to accept current existing models. Well, until an auto surgical suite is available and their new arms grown. So the most basic of personal life activities needs the assistance of an android and their boyfriend. 

A week after Joe’s attempted suicide he was found at a bar, like many of the other kids, attempted drinking themselves to death. Ironically enough, he accidentally met Rosanhi and Nithenoel Liamaris. Where they were doing the same thing, but were slightly more successful thanks to a more primitive black market auto pharmacology units supplied by their old “coach”. 

Rosanhi looks up, showing her heavily scarred right half of her face. Where Her right eye should be, a glowing red camera replaced it. What was definitely a face any high school/college boy would’ve fallen for. She brought up a glass with her clawed hand to take a swig of beer. Then sets it down. Recently she got out of the hospital with a crushed lower vertebrae. She joe and her sister said that she slipped and slid down a set of stairs. Alex at first brushed it off as bad luck on her part. But after what happened to Kali. He immediately doubted that claim.

“So, what is ushu?” She asked. Showing silver canines under a scarred lip.

Before Alex can shut it down, Kali walks in wearing a… what. She’s wearing a long sleeved tube top exposing her midriff with short shorts. Her brown hair done up in a ponytail. Her blue eyes looking out at the gathering. Clearly Shelly was fucking with her.

“Wait. You have never seen star ravagers?” She asked surprised then taking a seat by Alex. 

“We were too busy with our mom’s car shop, school, and our time….” Nithenoel trails off. Then looking at an empty whiskey glass seemingly to will it to fill up. Then takes a shuddering breath. “But a lot was lost during that revolution paired with more shows showing up. so we never even heard of it unfortunately.” She shrugs.

“We understand.” Alex said quietly. Gently grabbing Kali’s hand and looking at her. “So we may need to watch it and compare it to futurama’s episode on “snu snu”.”

“Okay I’m under the impression that it sounds an awful lot like bukakae.” Conrad said with a snicker.

All the humans at the table bursts out laughing while the aliens stared at them in confusion. 

“What’s bukakae?” The aliens at the table said.

The humans looked at each other. “It’s best you don’t know.” They said at once.

They continued talking throughout the night.

“HeYy GuYs!” A drunk Farren shouted. “wE ShOuld ShOw tHeSe sEa ApEs OuR GlOrIUs sONg oF OuR MiGhTy EmPIRe!”

“Who the fahck are those wankas?” Jack said.

“They’re the black site marine guards those AIs captured.” Kaldu said with a snort. “They’ve been acting like this for a while now. Can’t accept the fact that they can’t go home.” 

Those Ferran marines had started singing for the next six minutes about how their empress is great and how their empire would rule the stars. And how no enemy would stand in the way of their “destiny”.

Then they burst out laughing and poking fun at the humans.

Jack stood up. “LISTEN UP YA RED JARHEAD CUNTS!” He shouts stunning the crowd. “WHY DONT WE SHOW THESE WANKAS HOW REAL SOLDIERS SING! SYNC UP!”

————-

[sung like this](https://youtu.be/5HtVYr9aKRM)

————-

The martians began to sing about a hero who didn’t seal his suit right and died of asphyxiation. He has his family and the medics and commanding officers poked fun at him for not checking his seals.

The whole place was silent. The aliens stared slack jawed. The only ones who weren’t were the twins who seemed more amused. Though that may be because of the fact they were gladiators and have seen all manners of death.

“I am sober now.” One of the Ferran marines said.

The humans bursts out laughing. 

Alex sat back down chuckling at the fact Kali and kaldu were staring at them slack jawed.

“How? Why?!” Kali couldn’t even form the words.

“We have a similar song.” Rosanhi said laughing along. 

“It’s so we can wear space suites properly without dying!” Nithenoel chuckles out.

“Why would your lot poke fun at-you know what. Never mind.” Kaldu takes a swig of his beer. “You people are so weird.” He mutters.

12,oz96i8,HFY,Fri Aug  6 18:40:55 2021,"Demon City, Part 18","**C18: To The Surprise of Absolutely Nobody, I Get Along Well With Lawyers**

I woke up with a feeling of urgency and panic. I didn't remember much, but I had a nightmare that night- of being trapped, then fighting, then yelling at someone. *Don't need a shrink to diagnose that one. SIA's got me cornered. I know for a fact that anal sex  doesn't cause bad dreams.*

Checking the clock by my bed, it was 7:45 AM. Richard was still asleep beside me, with an arm around my waist and a satisfied smile. *I better see to those waffles. If the smell doesn't wake him up,  I've got... other methods.* I carefully disentangled myself without waking Richard, then crept to the kitchen. I decided on the wear-nothing-but-an-apron sexy classic for cooking.""Waffle-waffle, waffle-waffle-waffle,"" I softly sang to myself as I hunted for the waffle iron.

I was almost done with the first batch of waffles when I got a text from Isaacs buzzing my phone. *Don't you dare ruin my morning, assholes.*

&lt;&lt;from: Isaacs&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;It's Isaacs. We need you to come in to the HQ at some point today, but it's not urgent.&gt;&gt;

*Good, my internal aggression is working.* I texted back that I'd show up around 4 PM, which Isaacs indicated was fine. 

The kitchen table was set with plates, utensils, and orange juice when Richard walked in half-dressed and rubbing his eyes. *I feel like I need to give someone a phone call after breakfast, was it SIA? Or-* ""Sorry I fell asleep last night, I can leave when, uh- um.""

I used magic to float a plated stacked with waffles to kitchen table. ""I hope you'll stay for breakfast. The waffles are very hot, and if you're not hungry yet, I've got an activity for you."" I walked up to him and trailed a hand up the swell of his pants, then spun and walked over to the kitchen countertop, my bare cheeks fully presented and swaying to tempt him. ""Can you fuck me quick and hard over the countertop? Pretty please, Richard?""

I giggled when he walked over and pressed into me, his hands drifting from my back to feel up and under the apron. One hand gripped and pulled at my tit, and another snaked  lower and lower to tease my pussy. ""You're rather feisty this early,"" he mused as rubbed my ass up against him.

""And you're rather over-dressed,"" I breathed back. Richard's fingers left their cozy place between my legs to unzip and pull his pants down as I moaned for him to fuck me. ""All at once- I- Ah!"" I scrabbled a bit on the counter as he thrust himself into me, then pumped faster and faster, gripping my ass with both hands. I encouraged him to fuck me as hard as he could, and he obliged, my spine tingling and toes curling.

We came together after a minute or two. I felt Richard tense and slow his thrusts, then empty into me, giving me a blissful, full feeling in my core. *Not as strong a performance as last night, but hey, I did ask for a quickie,* I thought with a smirk. We stood there for a moment, his breath tickling my ear and his hands squeezing my ass. Finally he slid out, and I arched myself back to nibble on his neck a bit. ""Hah-ahhhh... I think the waffles cooled enough to eat.""

I had Richard sit across me and let him have the syrup first. At my request, he kept his pants off. *Just 'cause.* He asked about magical conjuration, since I was able to easily make things out of thin air, and his brain was still a little frazzled. I had him try to make a rubber ducky- without any demonic improvements, obviously. Richard couldn't make more than a yellow rubber ball, but I told him to keep practicing to improve it and then gave some mental exercises to try out.

""But yeah, I wanna try something,"" I said once we were half-finished with the meal and he'd given up making a ducky for now. ""Stay right about... there."" I slipped under the table with a wink and crawled over to his spot. My hands ran over his thighs and I gently pushed his knees apart.

""Ah, that's!-""

""Shhh... You can keep enjoying breakfast, while I... clean up a little."" I told him as I nibbled and licked up his inner thigh, sampling both our fluids.  I reached his tip and kissed it, running my tongue over a sticky wetness. I took the time to smell and taste, and rub myself against Richard's shaft as he got harder and harder. Needless to say I was *dripping* from my kneeled position under the table, enraptured by the cute little noises I could make. *I won't pull from him, but I'll enjoy the moment.*

My hands slid up to his hips and abs, marveling as they tensed and relaxed under my fingers. I got a little carried away tracing each muscle I could find and inhaling the smell of us both as blew him. I worked with my tongue to stroke and tease and suck on Richard, my thoughts wholly consumed by pleasing him. He was mostly... successful in just letting it happen and concentrating on his food. *This is so hot, I should try this more.*

""Gah-ah!"" Richard gasped as he came into my waiting mouth. I made sure not to miss a single drop, then finished cleaning him off with my tongue, swallowing it all. Proud of my job, I slunk back on the floor to my chair and crept up to my seat.

Seeing Richard's plate was empty, I quickly finished mine, took a swig of orange juice, and started cleaning the table with some magic to show off. ""So how was breakfast?"" I asked casually as I leaned back in my chair.

""How on Earth are you still single?!"" Richard asked once he recovered from whatever magical mental place I sent him. 

I'd gotten variations of this question for years. ""I... don't think now's a good time for a relationship for me."" *Or probably ever,* I worried.

Richard whistled. ""Well let me know when you're taking applications, because God*damn*.""

*If I'm exposed and* not *run out of town, I could set up a 'sexy-friend-application' website for the daring... I've easily got the web design skills, and probably the looks? I've never actually taken slutty pictures of myself for public viewing... So I might have to do some research for that.* ""Well, glad to know I'm appreciated,"" I mused. My mind, though, was a little busy considering the website. *The design would be sexy, but tasteful. Better to imply than just throw it out there. But what questions would I ask in the application? 'Are you okay with multiple orgasms and a little nibbling on your Soul?' 'Please list all kinks you think no one else would be willing to do that you'd want to do all at once?' ''Opinions on cuddling before or after sex?'  ''Exorcists, Solicitors, SIA Agents, and Circus Clowns need not apply?'  Maybe I'm being harsh on clowns, but-*

""-Lilllian!?"" Richard was waving his hands across my face, rather concerned.

""Huh, what?"" I said, somewhat surprised. Richard was dressed and had his coat over his arm.

""You uh, you zoned out for a bit there,"" Richard said sheepishly. ""I have to uh, go. Shift's starting early and all, and uh- I know this is a one-night-mgph!"" I cut him off with a deep, intimate kiss.

Then I broke it off. ""Yeah, it's' fine. It's fine, don't worry. It's a Monday. I'm gonna make a phone call soon anyway. *Suuuper* private. More importantly, I've got your number now, so... Maybe I'll send you a text when I'm free sometime, yeah?"" I didn't need magic to know Richard was into that. He waved goodbye and left a minute later, and I was all alone in my apartment again. 

As soon as the door shut, I threw my arms up in a panic. ""Who the fuck *was* I going to call this morning!? Fuck! I said it, so now I'm committed."" I ran over to my phone and scrolled through my contacts. *It's before nine on a Monday morning, and I'm certain everyone's either busy or asleep. Maybe my purse has something, or else I'd call my family, and that'll be awkward right now. Super awkward.* I ran to my bathroom and checked my purse, finding a mess of products and... a paper stack in a folder.

*Legal shit. That looks important.* I skimmed the documents and they made absolutely no sense, so I rooted deeper into my bag and found the business card of the lawyer Isaacs got me.

""Stills... Married guy, short. Yeah, I'll call him."" I ran back to my living room and got a spare laptop I used for fun activities that weren't porn-related. 

It took three rings before a woman with a soothing, breezy Southern accent answered my call. ""Office of Jeremy Stills. Stephanie speaking. How may I help?""

""Hi, uh, I'm Lillian Smith. I just became his client a few days ago. We had a meeting in SIA HQ, and I have a couple- lot of, actually I have a lot of questions. Is he available?""

""Let me check-"" I heard indistinct mumbling on the other end. ""Yes, I think he's able to talk to you about your case for a bit. I'll transfer you over now.""

""Great, thanks, I uh-"" The phone clicked a few times.

""Hello Miss Smith, this is Jeremy Stills speaking. I take it you wanted to call about your case?""

""Yeah, uh-"" I considered for a second. ""I have no idea what's going on, and the papers you gave me that I *can* read still make no sense. My sister's supposed to be in the loop and she told me last night she's confused too. It's like a weird Signatory application? So I'd like to know what's happening with my case."" *I am so out of my depth here.*

I heard papers shuffle around. ""Well, very succinctly, SIA is sponsoring a C-S-12/A Signatory status for you. It's rather costly and extensive, and rare, but my firm, Kravis, Von Ilchen, and Ulibor, is the best in town for Supernatural Law and we've done a few C-Signatory cases before. Our office is national, so we'll have multiple specialists and consultants available to help you as well if something comes up outside of my expertise.""

I felt a wave of unease as I remembered my friend Elliot laugh about big law firm hourly rates. ""And um, how is all this being paid for?"" I asked in a meek voice.

""My retainer is being paid for by SIA in the current matter considering your dealings with SIA. Other items like, for instance, magical estates or extra-planar disputes may not be covered, and you'd have to pay yourself."" I asked what the hourly rate was, and Stills gave me a number at least twenty times higher than I thought was possible.

*All those bar tabs are now flashing before my eyes.* I gulped audibly. ""So if SIA decides to cut their payments off and force me to pay your fees?...""

Mr. Stills laughed. ""That's never happened before, and looking over your case, I don't see it coming about. *We've* only had a few cases of lawyers refusing clients once they've started with us, and it's never about money- A few years ago, SIA tried to get in-person legal representation for a... powerful Supernatural, but gave up when she tried to Contract our poor Associate into gruesomely killing himself for her own amusement. He's alive, whole, and still working for us, don't worry!"" *That definitely sounds like Isabel.* ""The rest of the case had to be done via paperwork and a remote video feeds. But we still did it, and SIA still paid in full.""

""Right, I'm confident I'm not going to do that. Um. What's my case?"" I poured myself another glass of orange juice and tried not to scream, 'That fucking bitch, yet again!' out loud.

""Put succinctly: You've been sitting between legal cracks in the law that makes things difficult for both yourself and SIA.  So SIA wants to get you a special Classified Signatory status and employ you as a part-time consultant. There may be some oaths and paperwork that are mandatory, but it'll be manageable. The benefits of Signatory status are, well, *immense*. I assure you."" 

*That damn carrot again. Time to test out Client-Attorney privilege to see whether it's as good as a Contract.* ""That's a nice carrot to dangle, but I'm pretty sure I'm *literally* enslaved to SIA right now, and it's very stressful. Some SIA employees are nice and accommodating, but I had to sign documents saying I'd follow their Agents' orders, answer their questions, and submit to monitoring and a bunch of other stuff that's very distressing. I've had magical restraints put on me, for instance, and detained in that creepy room! Which sucks. And I have to follow any field Agent's order with almost no wiggle room."" *If this lawyer fucks me over, I don't know what I'll do.*

I heard more shuffling in the background. ""Well then when you put it like- Ahh, are you forced to obey oaths and written contracts to the letter by your magic, like a Fae or Demon? By example, those are the only two species I know with this magical quirk. I don't know your species and didn't want to presume.""

I chewed my lip. ""That assessment of my limitations is correct, to my knowledge."" *He'd figure that part out immediately after spending twenty seconds talking to Anne anyway.*

""Well, the NSDC has a few ugly, literal bits in it that make the probation period difficult. Not a lot of Fae go for Signatory status, and I suspect this is why."" Stills sighed deeply, and I heard his keyboard clack over the phone. ""What I'm going to do is have an Associate send over Double-F, err, stands for 'Fae-Friendly' documents you can read and sign instead of what you currently have. It's the same content, but it'll be much easier for you to read. Furthermore, double-F documents contain language such that you won't be Contracted when you sign them. SIA can't offer these, but we can. Anything blurred by the NSDC isn't something we can work around though until you yourself get status. It'll give you more leeway with SIA Agent interactions, at least.""

*I'm not going to feel relieved until I see those papers in my hand.* ""That would be much appreciated. I'd like to see those documents.""

""Of course, we'll mail them overnight to you,"" Stills demurred. ""I will also henceforth, during my duties as your lawyer, couch all legal advice and general conversation with you in terms such that a Contract, uppercase C, will not be formed unless you want one, and you have leeway to not share personal information unless you choose to. Is your magical Contracting enforceable with another person verbally?"" I told him it was. ""This I swear by my profession."" My magic washed over me, and I shuddered heavily. *My magic really reacted to that one.*

""That appears to have worked, Mr. Stills. Very appreciated.""

""Happy to help. I'm still reading through, but your case is *rather* unique. It's analogous to... You're familiar with 'Genius' immigration visas, right?""

I thought for a bit. ""Like how Einstein got citizenship a while ago?"" 

""Yes, like that. Because you're a slight unknown, in exchange for cooperation with the Government and consulting services- which I'm still not clear on yet- security clearance for this should arrive tomorrow- You get Classified Signatory status on par with Faction Heads or great talents our nation deems critical to invest in."" 

Surprised, I sprayed orange juice out my mouth and coughed to keep the rest down, but Stills just kept talking. ""Your potential Signatory document and most other necessary documents would list you as 'Other', but it's there in the fine print. That no one really reads"" *Holy shit, SIA could ask me to testify in front of Congress at this rate.* ""Fascinating case, simply fascinating. Isaacs is smarter than he looks. Normally we deal with a small group of people for this all at once, but with just one being it really cuts down on the headaches. I'm rather curious what you have to offer SIA for them to bend over backwards like this.""

*Fuck it, it's nervously-allude-to-details-that-can-out-you week.* ""... Species and experience-related knowledge for a case he's working on. Which also could impact future cases?"" That didn't trigger SIA secrecy regulations to literally stop me from talking, which prevented more embarrassment.

My lawyer laughed. ""Oh, you didn't actually have to answer that. But that's a very clever non-answer. Ever thought about becoming a lawyer?"" *There's a screwing versus screwing over joke I  could have told him if he got the clearance.*

""I uh, I liked computers a lot more in college. So I do that now. Sorry. Also, I had to sign some stuff that I couldn't read before you came in. Blurry stuff, and Isaacs told me it was good for me and I was super nervous about even being let out again.""

I heard more paper shuffling. ""Oh, hmm... Very clever."" Stills tsk'd. ""The blurriness is an unfortunate part of the NSDC that I don't think SIA has found a work-around for yet. It was a stupid debate that hampered Signatory adoption for a few years for anything other than Witches, Vampires, and Weres. The most established groups. I know the human NSDC authors didn't want people to rules-lawyer the most basic of this nation's laws and common sense before they agreed to not commit things like mass murder or treason, but with Witches it's always hard to tell what they were thinking."" I drank down the rest of my glass, then floated in some more orange juice from the fridge, and typed up a few more notes. Mostly, 'What the Fuck Witches, everything new I learn about you is absolute shit.' repeatedly in large caps.  *Fuller and I will have words soon.*

""In the future,"" my lawyer continued. ""-And I probably don't have to mention this considering your limitations with Contracts- But I'd advise you not to sign or attest to *anything* law enforcement gives you until your lawyer is in the room to look at it and advise you. You got very, *very* lucky this time around thanks to Isaacs. He bent and pushed a lot of rules and regulations.""

I still had a sour feeling that Isaacs screwed me over. ""What exactly did Isaacs do?""

""Typically, a potential Sole Signatory- A Signatory of a species and society without a Declarant has to undergo *serious* processing upon showing up here. Background and mythological checks, wellness and financial checks, biometric and magi-metric checks, psychological assessments. This is regardless of whether they've been living here five centuries or popped out of a magic portal five minutes ago, to be safe. And it can take a while depending on how close or far you are in species to something they've already seen."" 

That reminded me of a question I'd always had. ""Also, um, side-note. I always wondered but was afraid to ask this: Why the focus on species for status and classification. Isn't it kind of racist? Surely *everything* can't be species based.""

""You are somewhat right,"" Stills agreed. ""The species part is the first baseline SIA, legal, and agencies look into. Certain stuff is just baked into your genes and that's that, sad to say. We've yet to find a Fae without truth-telling magic, or sun-resistant Vampires and Dusk Elves, Weres that can stay indoors and unchanged on a full moon, et cetera. Species-related needs are often the first, and most pressing accommodations SIA makes. Frankly from what I've seen, Supernatural societies revolve around those traits as well. Court Fae societies have a scaled back legal system, Dusk Elves like to dwell underground, and I'd imagine your life and culture similarly works with what you've got. Let me be clear, when you're a Signatory your species classification only adds rights and protections. It doesn't take any away.""

*What would a Succubus society look like, anyway? Besides a giant porn set or creepy medieval depiction of Hell.* ""Okay, uh- cool. I'll try and think of that in a positive way. What do humans have baked-in genetically?""

""Based on my experience working as a lawyer? Obstinacy, illiteracy, and short-sightedness."" I couldn't help but laugh. ""Or maybe I just get a lot of bad clients.""

""As one of your clients, I hope not."" I said. ""What's my process going to look like?""

""Well, for you it'll take a little while to set up and get running, and you're in a prison-like limbo in the meantime. Weeks or months from start to finish, depending on backlog and even then there's a decent amount of hurry-up-and-wait issues. S-C-12 processes are usually done in government facilities made for handling larger influxes of magical beings.""

I cringed at the thought of more SIA interrogation rooms. ""I don't- that sounds pretty spooky. Like a blacksite where you're disappeared."" *With vivisection tables and an overseeing Army General with a buzzcut and a 'just kill-em-all' attitude towards the aliens. Except I'm the alien.* But I didn't want to sound too paranoid.

""Well, obviously we'll never hear about any secret blacksites, but it's more like when the Greyfoot Ogre tribe just poof'd into Kansas about-oh, five years ago. Did you see happen to see that on the news? The government had to set up a refugee camp, inoculations, food supply chains, interpreters, and education crash courses for about five thousand beings quickly. There's an interesting documentary on it if you've got the time, fantastic success with only about two years needed for full integration."" 

My sole experience with Ogres was this sweet construction worker named An'Thag. We met roughly a year ago at an outdoor Sup' bar, and he stretched me out and hit *deep* like nobody's business back at his place. *Eight and a half feet of muscle I could climb like a tree, with dick like 'wow'. That was such a good night... I wonder if I kept his contact information?* Probably *not what Stills wants to discuss, though.* ""I'll see if I can locate that documentary,"" I said tactfully.

""Yes! Sorry to get off topic for a bit, but it seemed relevant. So, Isaacs pushed the C-S-12/A status for you, which is completed a bit faster than the regular wait process, and flips the priorities. Delicate to thread the needle, and if there's an incident you'll have to deal with the regular probation at *best*. That'd be a lot of paperwork and time to switch over, so I'd suggest you not make a public scene and out yourself or commit felonies.""

I snorted, thankfully without any orange juice bubbling up. ""I have *no* intention of outing myself or committing felonies. How does it flip SIA priorities though?"" I asked.

""Well, for example, take the weekly checks by an SIA Intermediary- Usually an SIA Agent."" Stills sniffed a bit at that. ""With the regular process, the Agent treats you as potentially hostile, and works in the best interests of the government to make absolutely sure you're not a threat to established Signatories and Citizens. I'd liken it to an experienced probation officer.""

""So, it that normal SIA agent behavior in your opinion?"" I said with a hint of sarcasm in my voice.

Stills laughed. ""Perhaps, I haven't met enough SIA Agents yet to be sure. Now, this procedure is absolutely necessary under the NSDC- but Isaacs sidestepped it by getting Judges to make your case a C-S-12/A. Not even a C-S-12/B, considering you've lived without incident in the US for roughly your entire life with a rock-solid paper-trail. Asides from a week or more of awkward priorities and shuffling as paperwork is checked across agencies and researchers, your SIA Intermediary will be your advocate as you transition from Unknown status to Signatory status. So... more like a Social Worker prioritizing your well-being.""

I rolled my eyes a bit. ""Isaacs' paycheck comes from the SIA. He's armed like, all the time,  That's a real probation officer vibe I'm feeling.""

""Right, but intermediaries are much more than that. Normally for C-S-12/A's, an Intermediary will be an all-around expert on issues that would affect the applicant's species. Isadora Brazos, Declarant of the River Nymphs, for instance, got to work with Professor Samuel Key up in Florida, an industry-leading Oceanologist and- I'm forgetting the word for studying rivers, sorry. Key also had a team of legal, mythology, ecology, and fine arts experts he consulted with, to my recollection. That's a public case to give you a feeling of the moving parts. Isaacs appears to be- hmmm.""

*Shit, what if he just figured out I'm a Demon?* ""Appears to be...?""

""My documents show Agent John Isaacs is an established expert on Fae and Demons, which necessarily gives him a good grounding on Contract magic, negotiations, and more. If he's worked on cases like this before, I won't know until the security clearance comes through. And he's been requesting consultants with backgrounds in Midwestern Americana, Internet Technology, Contract Law, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, defense contractors and military, the list goes on. Fascinating. This is going to be a massive case, and the NDA's look airtight.""

*What in the absolute fuck is he planning?* ""Yay?""  I said. 

""'Yay' indeed. So I'd say what's going to happen is that you'll be qoute-un-quote enslaved for a bit. The Double-F documents we're going to send over should also help alleviate the pressure. Minimum of a few weeks, maximum of a year.  I'm guessing John Isaacs is at least smart enough not to choke the golden goose, so they'll treat you well. Then your technical probation status will kick in and things will be much more smooth until you get Signatory status. Depending on the size of the backlog and you'll be a Signatory in less than a year.""

*A year's still a long time.* ""Ok, and what about my consulting position? It's the main vector for the whole enslavement thing. I'm not even sure I'm getting paid."" Isaacs being my 'handler' wasn't forgotten either. ""You may have told me a bunch of this stuff already when we first met, but I really didn't understand and was not in a good headspace for it.""

""Totally understandable, I don't enjoy SIA holding rooms either. Ahh... Aha! Yes that job's a lynchpin of Isaacs' strategy. He's your handler as well, sort of a combination of a guide and bodyguard for you if the documents for C-S-12/A's kick in. So I'd suggest keeping with the non-combat consulting position until the Signatory process starts, even if you hate it. And... That's a lot of redacted lines in these documents, so I won't be able to tell you more at the moment. But! Your paycheck will be wired to your listed bank account at the end of next week. Bimonthly, it seems... At least the pay's good for a part-time position? I'm kind of jealous.""

""...What's the pay-rate?"" Stills told me and I spat out more orange juice, thankfully missing the laptop. ""That's- *hack*\- that's a lot per hour!"" I could actually pay Stills' legal fees once that rolled into my bank account. *Or some fancy new, not-twenty-something-chic furniture. And a really nice car. And upgraded servers and laptops.*

""Like I said, they're serious about having your expertise on call for whatever this is. Ah, I regret that I have an 11:30 AM meeting I need to prepare for soon. But I believe you have my email listed in your documents, and will promptly reply to future questions via email. Future non-emergency calls will likely need an appointment through my secretary due to my schedule. Will that be all?""

I leaned back and considered. *We'll see if what he says pans out, but I'm liking what I've hearing so far.* ""That'll be all for now, yes."" We said goodbyes and hung up.  *Ok, the plan to free myself from underneath this mess is to start slow, and keep my lawyer updated on the entirely reasonable requests that should be in SIA's interest anyway. Because they're both paying me and my lawyer apparently? Arriving at 4pm instead of immediately today is a good first step. I have my own life to live right now.*

After stretching a bit, I checked up on my email for my server business, work, and personal accounts. Not too much was happening. *A lot of spam over the weekend. Delete, delete, delete. Pity I can't just work nude at the office. It's pretty nice.* Then I groaned into my hands as I realized SIA would likely give me a shitty government email account soon to handle confidential information. *I'm drawing the line at SIA swag given to new hires...* 

I had the radio play a local pop music station from my laptop as I took another therapeutic bath to clear my head. *But also to clean off the evidence from my body that I'm a dirty, dirty little Demon.* Bealzebubbles, first and second of their names, floated in the tub with me as I cackled a bit. *So, the next part of my day off will be lunch, then... There's a few books I bought last month that I've been meaning to read. Make some tea, start the one on the top of the pile... Then I'll dress to impress and waltz into the SIA front lobby like I own the place around 4, maybe 4:30 today.* I leaned back and hummed along to the radio, feeling a bit better.

Sorry I'm late, I almost forgot about this.

._._._._._._._._._._._._._._._._._._.

Dear person who said that patience was a virtue:

I would shove this virtue up your ass if I could.

It's been literal *days*, as my phone showed. The food was still blander than water, the nerds were still drooling over the results of my scans, and I haven't gotten a Fitbit yet. The good news: Puzzles had more mazes and tabletops, and the bot was decent too, it even managed to match the voicetone of whoever was talking... Too bad it was a computer the size of a tractor wheel.

She, Puzzles I mean, not the computer, was teaching me how to play checkers. If the players had a ratio of 3 to 10 pawn-like pieces, the board was a fancy techy looking hexagon, and considerably smaller than checkers. ""So I just have to avoid having my pieces eaten, and get five times to the lit up hex? Easy enough. How do we... Who goes first?""

""Prey goes first."" Oh yeah, this game was called '*Predator and Prey*', who chose a name so metal for glorified hard-mode checkers?

I know I said hard-mode... But I ended up violently and relentlessly beating Puzzles' tail-less ass. Destroyed. Obliterated. Shadow Realm levels of cheese. It's not so hard, really. You just move the herd as one and avoid having your chips singled out. And the hexes lit up in patterns, so it's half the job done for you. I even put a piece over the section that was to lit up in the next, and final, turn.

Begginer's luck? Too much animal planet and national geo? Am I the best? Yeah, I'm the best human player of P&amp;P, can't wait for an asian guy to take my title.

._._._._._._._._._._._._.

Aila was waist-deep in despair. *She* was the best 'Predator and Prey' player in the entire ship, and had a medal to prove it. And now a member of an unidentified species, who learned how to play less than a quarter day cycle ago, just beat her in five turns. And everyone would eventually know, because when living in an enclosed space, things move fast.

""I... Wha... How??""

""Did the great Aila just get beaten in her own game?"" Oh this was *just* perfect, Phirra saw first-hand how she got beaten by a giant.

""Go on, laugh at me. I know you want to."" 

""No, I don't think I will. I would rather tell everyone you got owned by a first timer,"" Phirra said, as she leaned in closer to Aila. ""Unless you wanna tell the high-ups about the banned file.""

Aila's jaw was hanging from a thread. She had forgotten about that, but she had her reasons. Phirra was new in the crew then, she thought she was gullible enough to be threatened with a staff report. Aila had also *accidentally* sent the report, she had to pull many favours to lower her punishment enough for it to not hinder her career. She did wrong, yes. She tried apologizing, but a humilliated mind is full of spite. Maybe... She should let her have this?

""You can tell them."" Aila finnaly said, before turning to her opponent. ""We'll play again, this time we switch sides.""

._._._._._._._._._._._._._._._.

I loved animal planet as a kid. Specially the ones where they showed pack hunters trying to get a meal. I may have watched too much, becasue I ended Puzzles' whole herd in eleven turns. She tried to go for the lights, spreading herself like a professional prostitute who just had a tubal ligation. It was a buffet.

I noticed that this game is also as balanced as a new character in a game with an already established meta. The predator has to take, in a reasonable way, one turn per prey piece, less if you're a crackhead like me, and use all your three pieces for three of your opponent's. Meanwhile, the prey starts with little over three times the pieces, and can win the game as long as they land their last piece on the last hex.

Puzzles was having an existential crisis. But if I discovered a talking dog, challenged it to a match of counter strike, and got my ass handed over, I too would be pretty angry. Armor was laughing their ass off, or I hope that's the equivalent for their beepings. I would laugh too if I was 100% sure. But by mere misunderstandings people got bedded. Or was it beheaded? I forgot how that expression went. But it's as old as a veteran from the south american liberation wars, so it's not like it matters that much.

Looking closely at Armor, a single question. One that every sane person has to ask after seeing guards. ""Hey... You guys have guns?""",/r/HFY/comments/p0nu30/tales_of_round_the_galaxy_dumbassery_madness_and/,12

*****

**Vivisection**

I glanced around the dimly lit run-down warehouse, looking at the chaos that was unfolding. We’d invited several of the ‘old guard,’ people all the way back from *Lucky’s* tavern, including its barkeeper. Others were ones we knew we could trust, and had run successful operations. Some of the cells were even from Talay. But now none of them seemed to know what to do, now that the plan had fallen apart.

The warehouse was massive, but everyone had crowded around the concrete dias that had once housed some sort of machinery that had long ago been ripped out for scrap metal. I stood up on the stage, watching, and unsure of my next words even as the chaos under me grew. I didn’t want to just demand ‘silence.’ But I couldn’t lead this mob of disparate people with everyone shouting, either, and I *didn’t* have a plan to suitably fill whatever void the silence I demanded would create. 

Azrea had been right. I hadn’t had any sort of plan for actually enforcing our demands for the Nobles, but I hadn’t even thought she’d refuse to bargain without them included in some sort of deal. I hadn’t excluded the nobles in the negotiations out of any intention to execute them, nor to renege on any deal I’d struck with her, but it reflected a total failure to adequately plan on my part. I’d been distracted. I’d gone ‘all in’ on this, even bringing some extra cells in to help move the prisoners in case the deal was struck quickly. Now they were arguing with each other, their arguments turning into shouting over each other, for want of anything productive to do, and I, their leader, had nothing to give them. Some of the arguments were devolving into shouting and shoving matches, Grey Mask one of the loudest and most aggressive. Most of the attendees were armed. 

As I watched things around me fall apart, I had to wonder: Had my failure to plan really been the only problem? Or had I grossly miscalculated and asked too much? Had the people I’d relied upon misled me about the hostage negotiation process? The Aliens were misbehaving, bucking the trend of their precious policy for the first time, and it was making me nervous. A millennia-old intergalactic empire had a bureaucratic stack that made ours look positively agile by comparison. No one was acting ‘normal’ anymore. One of the normally steadfast twins had shot an unarmed prisoner for mouthing off. Morsh had gone from ‘Natalie’s devout protector’ to harassing me into a corner. The Aliens weren’t following their own doctrine. If everyone around me kept at it, be it my own people or the Shil’vati, I wouldn’t be able to predict what the invaders would do next, or figure out who I could and couldn’t rely on to get the job done.

Worst of all, this was all my fault. We weren’t a democracy. I gave orders, and people followed them. I’d railroaded Vaughn and others’ objections and made a decision to try for this. I’d led us here. And right now, I had to seize control before this spiralled further out of my hands, and sent us careening over the edge. No one here was unarmed, and it wouldn’t take too much for someone to lose control and vent their anger, take charge of themselves because I hadn’t.

At last I cleared my head, twisted the knob until it clicked to the interior speakers, and  roared into the mic. “SILENCE!” My voice echoed sharply off the old structures’ walls, and everyone quieted down, turning to face me, all arguments forgotten. I lowered the volume back down to normal.

I knew I would need to follow it up with additional instructions. A plan. Things to do. A direction to head. 

“We have not been successful in our hostage negotiations with the Governess-General. This has a meaning, it’s valuable strategic information. Now we just need to figure out the ‘why’. Are they scared of us, and how can we best use that to our advantage?” 

A few people grumbled.

“Insofar as immediate concerns about funding that she presumed, let me assure you as well that we have sold many of the materials we acquired from the downed dropships- antigravity harnesses, weapons, charge packs, and more. These have filled our coffers through the coming months. We have enough to ensure that the revolution isn’t bankrupt- far from it. But the money wasn’t the issue. You heard her- even if it was a thousand a head, chump change even here, she’d have refused.”

“What are ya keepin’ ‘em alive for, then!?” Someone from Lucky’s challenged me.

More shouting now as other cells either voiced assent or tried to answer for me.

Anything Miskatonic took a ‘pass’ on for lack of scarcity, such as rifles and charge packs, we sold on the black market for near six-figure returns to us. I knew Sam was ripping us off, but I also knew we didn’t exactly have many other options. Considering the treasure trove the ship had spilled as it landed and we’d picked it apart, we had finally been able to reimburse Verns, Larry, and a few of the other key members of the resistance for their generous contributions. We also had acquired *some* ammunition for our recently acquired, somewhat exotic wares- enough to supply them to cells for a hit-and-run, but still not enough for any truly major protracted battles. It seemed we’d be stuck in second gear for a little while longer.

Washington had faced similar monetary worries with the Continental Army. I wondered if he’d lied to his own people, too, in times of great crisis just to keep things held together.

“Gentlemen! Let me settle this now- I do not fight this war for personal enrichment. The money wasn’t just about what we’d do with it- a nice car, a house, retirement? Is that why you signed up to fight, or expected when you joined? No, of course not. Then why did we need to ask for it anyways, you may ask?”

Silence as the crowd expected my answer. I at least sounded like I *had* one, which it seemed was all they really wanted.

“I asked for so much per Marine, hoping to create open season on any Shil’vati who managed to find themselves unlucky enough to be in our zone. You heard that price wasn’t the issue, and I want any unwelcome guest who’s dumb enough to try setting foot here to be on their tiptoes the entire time they are here. A cool *billion dollars* walking around on two legs is a tempting enough target for even the most straightlaced and hardworking Honest Joe. Next thing you know, the Marines aren’t just worried about *us*, but every single human who so much as sees them.” A few grumbles of assent now. The resistance members were settling down, following along now. 

I realized it was a good way to muddy the waters between ‘good honest citizen’ and ‘hardened insurgent.’ Occupying armies already had a hard enough time differentiating between the two- when all you had was a hammer, everything started looking like a nail. When a corner shopkeep who had no prior ties to us kidnapped a clueless noblewoman tourist, well, that distinction shrank so much further. The busier the hammer, the more violent the state became under their occupation and the further we drifted from their vision for us as little pink tuskless Shil’vati.

My job was to lead. To lead properly, and to form a new plan, I’d need information, and needed to instill a certain confidence, and to look like I wasn’t rattled by Plan A not working well.

“So ‘Azrea won’t bargain’- what of it? I happen to have another plan for our hostages, but I need to talk with them and some of you first, to make arrangements for Plan C, just in case Plan B doesn’t work out.” I didn’t feel like elaborating as to what either Plan B or C even were at this particular moment in time, only to let them know that things were in motion and that months of effort hadn’t all gone to waste. “I’ll approach some of you directly about our contingencies. So! This Governess-General Azarea won’t bargain? How long do we reckon she’s got left in command, before we get her booted out and another in, someone who’s ready to talk?”

A few cheers went up, and I gave the hand-on-chest ‘pledge of Allegiance’ salute, and watched the crowd return it, signifying the end of the meeting.

I was grateful for the mask, because despite my confident words, it hid how troubled and lost I felt, too. Did Azraea feel she was warm enough to our general numbers and location, that she felt ready to mop us up? Should I have ordered everyone to scatter, right now? We’d worked hard to hide our presence here, and had no signs of trouble. I looked over to Binary, and G-Man who was filling in as Sentry for Hex. Both flashed me a thumb’s up from their watch posts.

No sign of Shil’vati dropships or patrols. 

At least my little speech had seemed to work, people were breaking up and dispersing as I stepped off the centre of the Dias instead of arguing with each other. Some were waiting to see if I’d approach them with instructions for the promised ‘Plan B,’ or ‘Plan C.’ I didn’t want to turn this into a Q &amp; A, especially when I myself was so full of Q and short on A.

The Aliens were one of the biggest concerns right now, though. I needed to interrogate that interior agent again to find out. If negotiations were out and the aliens were behaving weirdly, then I needed to find out *why*. Had she lied to me? It wasn’t impossible.

I turned from the dias I’d been speaking from and walked toward the cell that held Myrrah, only to find Vaughn standing in my way. His body language suggested that he was pretty pissed off, too. But people also seemed to accept that he and I had something to talk about, and assumed it was about Plan B, so our watchers gave us enough space to converse privately.

The boy’s voice was tense and low. “*We need to talk*.”

“About what?”

“About whatever the fuck that was. Do you even have any idea what the meta of that conversation was? She picked you apart and you just...let her. Worse, Radio told me you’re planning on putting out another broadcast soon.”

“We’re at the mercy of whatever she decides to pay, and she feels she’s safe paying us nothing. I want to find out why. Maybe she’s afraid we’ll have our several billion to play with, set off a nuke or something. I want to know what it is they’re afraid of, so we can use it against them. Besides, you said that the Church I sent you to was a bust.” I tried to step around my first friend since elementary school, but he wasn’t having it. He sidestepped so he was in my way again.

“No. Wrong. Emperor, you are on the verge of making a *huge* mistake. Let me help you here. We- as an organisation, have a name and a face now. In the process, we’re becoming just like every other organisation- which is something they can seemingly pinch at will. They’ve nabbed so many other rebel cells before we came along and changed up the game on them. We’re *different*, and it’s throwing them off. Conforming to the norm now- bad idea. I hear you’re putting out another flick, even. This time it won’t take them by surprise, they’ll be ready to pan you for it with their media arm.”

“Why is it a bad idea?” I asked, feeling a headache creeping on. More doubts and uncertainties in my own actions was not what I needed right now.

“Radio says it’ll be full of stuff like *why we’re fighting* and all that other crap. It’s a terrible idea. Let me ask you: why are you doing it? What do you hope to gain? Because I promise you, it won’t work.”

“We have to start standing for something, Vendetta. People don’t follow or sign up to join *nothing*. We have to decide what matters to us, and what doesn’t. What we strike at them for doing, and what we let go because attacking it isn’t worth the effort, resources, or cost.”

From his body language, I knew his face had drawn into horror. “No, wrong wrong wrong! That’s even worse than hoping to snag a few recruits!”

“What’d I say?”

He threw both arms wide, then let them fall.

“If we see an opportunity to cut up some eggplants, we take it- always! Peaceful gathering, event, parade, ribbon-cutting, pie eating contest, I don’t care. We got the purps scurrying back into their armour, got them living back on the bases, some of the few aliens who moved in have been selling their land back to humans. What we’re doing is *working*. You’re changing the game, undoing their whole invasion and fucking up their whole plan! It’s great. But now you just risked everything, and got nothing tangible in return. All to ‘stand for something.’”

“We *have* to start standing for something, right?” That’s...what we fought for. Why we fought. Right?

He reached forward and grabbed me by the shoulders, staring up into my mask. “Look. What you just said is a mental trap. One of those rules *people* live by because they’re weak-willed sheep. People do all kinds of things that they only think they have to do, even though no one has ever outright said it. Don’t be like them. Don’t be *people*. Be you! You aren’t ‘people’ to me, E. You never have been, not since the day I first laid eyes on you. I’ve seen the rage inside you, that anger, that brilliant mind which can pull magic out of a hat. You’re greater than they are, and always have been. To step back in line now, at this stage of the game, would be a massive regression. Doing this kind of shit has doomed so many would-have-been-great movements throughout history. The leader starts trying to guide the zeitgeist. Don’t. You love history so much? Learn from it!”

“But, without a guide, without a leader…”

“You want a message for this movement so bad? Let it be ‘violence and death.’ If you start getting ideas about posturing up there in front of a camera again, all ‘high-minded’ like G-Man calls it, then you’ve fed the Media more ammunition the Talking Heads will tut-tut over. If you’re tall, they’ll say that you’re too tall, if you’re short, they will say you’re *too* short, if you’re anywhere in-between, then you’re ‘too plain.’ The Media will will do that with every aspect of you, and your movement, and its goals. The best way to beat them is to starve them. That’s why their only criticism is ‘you don’t have a message-’ it’s because you aren’t feeding them stuff to turn the public against you, and they *hate* you for it. It’s not a criticism you should listen to, and certainly you should not be taking advice from enemies you’re in the middle of beating. So don’t give them what they want on purpose, and certainly not for free!”

I considered his point, and knew I was grasping at straws now. “But even people on the street are curious, asking what we’re standing for. I have to give them an answer about why we’re fighting, about what it is that’s pissing us all off.”

“No! No you do not. Once you say what bothers you- then the aliens will have figured out what makes you tick. At that point your movement’s a slab of meat on the Shil’ operating table and they start poking and prodding at your nerves, seeing what makes you twitch and respond. They start mapping you out. Then you’re playing their game, on their time, and not long for this world.”

I tried not to think of what Hex had relayed back to me about what interning at *Miskatonic* was like. Slab of meat on a table, indeed.

“‘Playing their game’? What do you even mean?” I was getting frustrated, and realised I had my back up. It wasn’t a good look for someone who was hoping to project confidence, and I forced my body language to be more relaxed. 

“Say we do things your way. We put out some big statement saying what it is that pisses you and your movement off, I dunno- ‘Democracy is dead.’ Or ‘not printing the old versions of human books which don’t have Shil’vati shoehorned into them as the love interest,’ which I honestly don’t care about, or ‘not enough of a future’ for human men. Or maybe you want ‘Parker and Pierce’ back on air, or *whatever*. Or maybe there’s some governesses like in Maryland who were doing some really sick shit. Or fuck, maybe you just really hate the colour purple.”

I tried to not think about Natalie and the slight bit of worry in me, and I couldn’t help shake the feeling he’d missed a major point, though. At last, an idea came to me of how to respond, and I stopped squirming under the criticism of what I’d said and done so far.

“Ministriva was kidnapping boys. Surely kidnapping boys gets everyone mad- not like they can do anything to profile anyone on that.”

“Yeah sure and that’s bad, but- the one governess between her and the new one we’re dealing with now- I don’t even remember her name. Supposedly she started doing a lot to Ministriva’s family. Really taking them behind the woodshed- the whole Ministriva family is in disgrace and is losing their Noble status. Word is, some woman named ‘Amilita’ is heading up the charge to try and get the boys back and to try and hold people accountable.”

Good on the Lieutenant Colonel, I supposed. Though I’d learned to be wary of people who appeared to care about humans, by all standards, she’d been good and kind to me. I didn’t get the eerie feeling around her which I’d gotten with Ministriva, even when seeing her in private. Amilita seemed to be genuine, and Natalie held her in high regard, which certainly counted for a lot. But I needed to put those sentiments aside, and think like Vaughn. He was so good at putting himself in other peoples’ shoes. He understood peoples’ motivations better than anyone, and even if I found his methods disturbing I’d be a fool to ignore him completely.

At last, I realised his point.

“So, I’m guessing that after all the effort and circus and display made of ousting Ministriva’s family from the nobility, and making such a token gesture at getting the boys back, they’re surprised we didn’t stop bombing or killing.”

“Right? Isn’t that beautiful? They thought we’d stop, that we were appeased. Instead, we’ve got them running scared of us. Begging us to make it all *stop*.”

“Isn’t that right where we want them?”

“Yes. Forever.”

“Forever doesn’t work, Vendetta. People get tired of Forever Wars, especially pointless ones.”

“The aliens will tire first,” Vaughn said. “Besides. Say they return every boy. Do you stop?”

“No, I won’t. But the Shil’vati Empire has more planets than we have towns and villages. Some of those planets have triple Earth’s population.” I thought of the stars Natalie and I had seen- and how later on she’d shown me exactly how many of them belonged to the Shil’ Empire, including the entirety of Orion’s Belt. The sheer scale of their territorial possessions blew my mind.

“And what, the Empress decides to send everyone here, over you? I’ll grant they’ve gone through three governesses in about a year. Three. You replace them so fast, there’s not enough time to learn their names, let alone for them to grow tired of dealing with you before some other wrinkled up old bag gets appointed to put *her* butt in the chair and have a try.”

There was someone above these Governesses, though. There was the Planetary Governess. The position was currently held by the Fleet Admiral until the aforementioned Fleet left and someone appointed a fully civilian government to administrate the planet. Couldn't se imagine *them* getting tired of us?

“Besides, since when do you care what other people think? Remember how people made fun of you, and mocked you? Remember Lissie, and Jordan, and St. Michael’s, and so on? You don’t care about looks- you wear tattered rags to class most of the time. You’re the kind of guy who shows up to track meets on a bicycle and can still outrun everyone. I know you’re smarter than *people*, you’re *better* than them. I’m telling you not to imprison yourself, or shackle yourself to their expectations. Set yourself free- you don’t have to give a fuck about them. Now is not the time nor place to start pretending like you do or have to.” 

Was that really it? Was victory really so simple? But if the aliens were really getting desperate, then…

“But if they’re really desperate- Vendetta, we can end this! We can get…”

“Stop! I see you thinking it. And I’m telling you- that it is a trap. You’re doing what all of society has told you to do- to identify, stand there with a big grand old flag, say ‘here we are! Come get me!’ and then you know what happens? Everyone dies. The movement dies. Society *wants you to do* that, because then they can hammer you to bits. Society is interested in keeping the status quo, because it casts out everyone else. You are leading a *revolution*. A new status quo. Don’t you get it?”

“We don’t have to follow what we say, Vendetta.” He had a point, though. They’d cast me out, and I’d found an army waiting for me in the shadows.

“If you go against your word, it’ll work once, and reflect badly on you- to other people. You can promise you’ll let no transgression of something go unpunished, and then when you let it slide, the people who care will never forget it.”

“Oh, *now* you say we should care what other people think?”

Vaughn gripped at his hair. “Yes! And also no! Gah!” He kicked up dust around us, skater shoes scuffing on bare concrete.

“You’ve lost me.”

“You yourself made this point back at the library, how aren’t you getting it? Gangsters are throwing themselves against the Shil’, because the eggplants are all about ‘Law and Order’ and are really screwing up the dynamic those guys relied on. A lax justice system with a revolving door for misdemeanours under a certain cash value, a reliable stream of junkies, a presumption of innocence, street cred, and so on that these thugs have all made a life out of relying on. All that stuff’s *gone* now and the dealers and thugs want it back to the way things were. They don’t care that the odds are a trillion to one, all they care about is their street corner and hustle, and if that gets them to pick up guns and take potshots, then we’re fine with it. Anarchists see an Empress and start screeching in incoherent rage. Nationalists see the erasure of their borders and the sacrifices made to create them, and then live to see what got built by blood sweat and tears get torn down, and feel nothing but fury toward the Aliens. We arm these types of people and throw them at the Shil’vati almost daily, and it occasionally works to kill a Shil’vati or two in the process. That’s been our gig since day one, and it’s worked out great. The Shil’vati aren’t going to do any kind of outreach for those groups. They’re not here to make peace with Anarchists or bad boy drug dealer meth head outlaw riders, or Nationalists who refuse to bend the knee to their Empress and pretend like ‘we are all one people.’ The Aliens are here to shake hands with bureaucrats and toadies, get some sort of pretension of permission to start mining the planet, Saturn, Jupiter, the Belt, do some tourism, and turn us into Space Vegas, all ‘with our consent.’” He did finger quotes.

I thought of Vegas. A place with no culture. Plastic. Purely artificial in existence, and only through constant management and intervention was it even able to exist at all. It was great that it existed, but the entire planet turned into that… seemed awful. Worst part was, I could see his vision coming true. Not a word he spoke sounded untrue to my ears. I had to wonder if they took some sort of issue with my name. Vaughn waited for me to finish my thoughts before continuing, not even letting me get a word out.

“Only when we start kicking up enough of a fuss and start doing some real damage do the Aliens finally bother to ask anyone ‘why are the humans attacking us?’ The toadies get ‘oh those guys are backwards, ignore them.’ Except, the Aliens don’t like all the damage we’re doing, so they do the next best thing, and ask anyone they capture. As long as our strategy is to pull from all walks, then all the Eggplants will get is random static noise. Nothing they can build a trend out of, get a signal on. An outlaw rider war veteran will answer differently to a corner drug dealer who’s doing it for street cred, who answers differently to a nurse who lost her husband to the advances of a drunken Shil’vati marine at a bar, who answers to a couple schoolboys who’re out against the world, who will answer differently to a mechanic who’s lost their purpose in life, who’ll answer different to someone else who’s disaffected and tired of the bullshit that the Shil’vati represent to them. They can’t get anything meaningful to start profiling and tracking us by. What do these people have in common aside from being pissed off, and using us as a facilitator? Nothing!”

I felt him building up to his point, but I was impressed by the amount of thought he’d put into this, and how intuitive his grasp of people’s motivations were, and how that factored into our organisation and its security. “So as long as we keep pulling from cells everywhere, the aliens can’t figure us out. What we want, what drives us. Unless I tell them. Which I may have just done.”

“Right. See, the moment our pool of available rebels to send on these missions changes, because either the Nationalist or the Anarchist or the Nurse or whomever sees you go up there on that stupid propaganda flick of yours, and you blather your bullshit, they might just decide you don’t represent their anger the right way. The Shil’ will be able to start profiling the members we have left, who do care about the things you say your movement does give a shit about. They’ll notice the pattern- you talk about American patriotism, recruit patriots who are big fans of America, they’ll start taking a closer look at American patriots, and start snapping up anyone who’s flying too many flags, or even set up sting ops anywhere I’ve got left to snag prospective recruits, like the church you sent me to. Yeah, that place was absolutely a sting, by the way. Thanks again for that. That kind of operation the Feds are running will make recruiting all the more arduous and ponderous if it starts getting a finger on the pulse.” 

“Sorry about that. I saw the sign, thought it would have been a good place.”

“Yeah, I’m fine.” He didn’t even seem slightly phased that he’d nearly gotten pinched. ""But don't get off-topic. My point is, there are too many fringe groups involved right now for them to occupy even a tenth of them with feds and informants, and those guys are sitting there operating blind, and making themselves too obvious. But, everyone else- say, the Anarchists who don’t give a fuck about democracy, say, they don’t like what you said on your propaganda film. They split off to do their own movement, and now you’ve got a rival faction who don’t like the idea of other human revolutionary groups running around with guns so much and grabbing all the headlines, especially if you don’t stand for what they say they stand for. The Anarchists, for example, might even start getting in your way. Might even be the Shil’ decide to get smart and even arm them up a bit, like the CIA do.”

“The CIA? Are those guys even still around?”

“Yeah, but they’re probably on a reduced budget and licking boots, like the rest of our government. Seriously, though, stop getting me off track. This part’s what matters. If that’s what happens, and we’ve got different factions, then everything falls apart for us. Humans slaughtering each other’s fun to a point, but you lose whatever zeitgeist you’ve got going here. The aliens clamp down on both of us- hell, on all violence in general, and come out to the everyman looking like the preferable alternative. It feeds their narrative that the aliens have been pitching us, which is that we're a bunch of overgrown chimps who can’t manage ourselves without devolving into bitter conflict. Our little civil war tells everyone, even us, that we need them to rule and run our lives for us. Whatever unity you’ve got now, stops existing *real* quick if it comes to that.”

Plus probably our dignity and future rights, to boot. We’d be set back in the eyes of the galactic stage, seen as little more than squabbling children.

“Unity? What unity? Va- uh, Vendetta, when I was standing up there on the dias, do you know what I saw? People started shoving each other the moment it looked like I was weak or didn’t know what I was doing, or something went a little wrong. We’re a mob, unified by nothing already. This movement *needs more* unity.”

“You want ‘unity’? You want ‘nothing’? Try this scenario: Everyone in this thing dies, and dies for *nothing*, having accomplished *nothing*, *and* having squandered the little bit of unity you find yourself at the head of- which is ‘wanting to see blue blood spilled.’ What’ll *unite* us is that we will all have *nothing*, and we’re all *dead*. Don’t you get that? I’m fine going down in a blaze of glory with you. Violence to the end, brother. But don’t bore me with ‘we won’t hit this juicy target because it goes against our Morals and Principles or doesn’t serve Democracy.’ If it turns people away from joining us or to stop accepting bombs and armaments from us, then fine, *those* are valid reasons to not run an operation. I’ll accept and defer to your judgment there. Otherwise, though, you’re sabotaging what’s made us effective.”

Now I planted my feet. “You say I changed the game, and you’re correct. There’s a lot of excesses the Shil’vati are committing under the new governess, and it’s pissing everyone off. Even the state Congress is standing up to them now, because they’re afraid of us. We can find common causes- things that piss off everyone, or even ‘normal people.’ Normal people picking up arms and joining us won’t steer the Shil’vati toward profiling, unless they want to start a war with literally everyone. That’s the one thing they don’t want, and I say we could give it to them.”

“You asked what they fear- and listen to me when I’m giving you the answer: Both Congress *and* the Shil’vati *are afraid of you*, because you are ‘The Unknown.’ Congress doesn’t pass anything against human interest anymore, because that bunch of dickless cowards don’t know what will set you off and get you coming around again and making good on that promise to wipe out their families. *That* is what makes you dangerous, and effective. Don’t ruin it by giving everyone a laundry list of do’s and don'ts, especially with high-minded stuff, because then the aliens will figure out exactly where the line is with you, and cross it only when they’re heavily armed and waiting! You’ll have bound your word to action in front of everyone, and be obligated to strike, or else you’ll look weak and impotent. No middle ground, there.”

I took a deep breath. I was frustrated because I didn’t have answers. I didn’t have answers, because I’d led the entire insurgency on a pipe dream of negotiating alone against an intergalactic empire and somehow holding them to their word, and hadn’t listened to Vaughn or any of my lieutenants. I’d done the moral thing. But maybe I needed to learn to accept advice. 

“I see your point. We’d lose the initiative. We couldn’t pick our own strikes and claim meaningful victories anymore. Azraea would never negotiate a real peace and intend to keep it.”

Vaughn nodded quickly. “Right, you’re getting it now. Besides, if you are fighting for a peace agreement, that’s like fucking for virginity. Give up any ideas of ‘peace’.” He spat the word like it was four letters long. He was right, again. We were welcome to give our bombs and guns up, and go back to living quietly. The Shil’vati would be glad for us to do so. It would be ‘peaceful,’ true. But we wouldn’t have any kind of life worth living if we did. “You’re in this thing to turn Shil’vati into corpses. Nothing more. Say or do whatever it is to further our purpose or whatever you need to in order to justify the bloodshed. But don’t start believing your own hippie-dippie bullshit you sell to the masses. Ask Sam about ‘getting high on your own supply,’ and where that leads.”

I sat still for a bit. That made me feel hollow. Empty. Like I would be a liar, a charlatan. I’d just told my first major lie to my people, and now Vaughn was asking me to make a habit of it, or at least to embrace some sort of perspective I couldn’t accept. Was it a joy in the bloodshed that he felt, or was it a hatred he harboured so deeply? What motivated Vaughn? Wait. What had he said? Believing my own bullshit?

“What if we did it anyway?” I asked, slowly, quietly. Vaughn looked like he was about to explode, but I held up a finger and he contained himself, albeit just barely. “What if we do it anyway, *on purpose*. We don’t *actually have to* *care*. But we find new ways to surprise them, and get them to think they know our motivations, and then surprise them with violence again, just like how they thought holding Ministriva accountable would get us to stop? We keep them guessing about why we are fighting, which is *exactly* what we’ve been doing, and you even said that it works. So, we give them a false lead. We could get them to think we’re twitching on the operating table, get them to *think* we’ll have to respond to some transgression and waste tons of effort setting the trap- and then when we don’t, because we don’t really give a shit, they think we have lines of intelligence running into their operations, have wasted tons of manpower hours in the wrong places, because we didn’t care at all in the first place. Then, when they think they’re doing something innocuous, keep it under a light guard stretched thin from the misunderstanding, we pound them solidly? Deliver a real sucker punch. Do *that,* over and over.”

“It works for keeping them confused and on their toes,” he said suspiciously. “But if you air this vid you’re cooking up with Radio and reach out to them, then the movement is all but over. You’re cashing in your chips and saying ‘this is the high water mark for recruitment.’ That ‘this is as big as our movement can grow.’ You’ll suffer huge recruitment losses.”

“Not if it’s something that offends everyone- like Ministriva kidnapping boys. Or, what if there was something to *rally* everyone? Something to really cause everyone to rise up?”

“You think that- but you’d be surprised how something you think of is universal is going to hurt recruitment when we’re also recruiting from the far reaches of political and ideological thought. Some of the more hardcore women’s movements might not like it,” he warned. “People who sympathise with those groups are pissed off that they can’t compete with seven foot tall hulking muscle-bound aliens, who can and will shove them into lockers, are changing up the dating game and ripping away the power they’ve got in dating. When you’ve got beach body seven foot tall women who fuck at a wink, suddenly flowers and chocolates, a stuffed bear for valentine’s, all that stuff’s gone. Their power to get men to do what they want in exchange for sex or partnership is *gone*\- and boy those women are *pissed* about it. ‘Missing boys’ doesn’t speak to *that* issue, and for some, maybe it’s their only drive to really sign up. Your message then doesn’t speak to the disenfranchisement that those girls and women are feeling. If anything, it says you care more about men and boys, which they won’t like.”

I realised Vaughn wasn’t saying they were good or bad people for it. To Vaughn, convincing someone to get a rifle in their hands and aimed at the enemy to create corpses was all that mattered. Whatever was effective or worked to make that happen, then he’d do it.

I shrugged. “Alright- fair point I guess, but we can set out another video about that, *too*, or just start sending people out to Town Halls. We come up with new videos, one for every possible reason or cause we’re fighting for. Social activist groups, too, like the one you reported back from. Sorry again about that one being a bust, by the way.”

“Yeah, whatever about the church,” Vaughn came around slowly to the idea. “But your idea... yeah, what’re the Feds gonna do if someone- say, a less...direct volunteer, goes into all these activist groups and just starts *talking* about how we’re ‘for their cause,’ and then slips out before they can be ID’d? Fucking nothing. Every possible focus group meeting- even some Town Halls. The messages don’t *have* to be coherent or tie in together, because we don’t mean *any* of it. The Aliens’ data lights up like a switchboard. They’ll be yanking their tusks out in frustration... Yeah, alright.” He was nodding along slowly now. “Raises recruitment, all the mixed messages stops any blunting in the recruitment, and it keeps the aliens from profiling us, even when we tell them directly what we want. Okay, that raises our numbers. What next? I know you. You’ve got something on your mind, don’t you?”

He had a good idea about visiting Town Halls. It was time we went mainstream. Finally, I had something for some of us to do. I wanted to shift from foot to foot, but forced myself to stand still and project confidence. This idea didn’t deserve even a letter ‘C,’ let alone the word ‘plan.’ But I saw all the parts lining up. I felt the *possibility* of it. 

“We’ve been hitting a lot of humans in our strikes. Most of the time, at least a few of them get caught up in the crossfire. What do you say if we start hitting the eggplants directly? Find a *new* way to hit them, one that the Shil’vati will never expect from us. We’ve been doing things that no one’s ever done before. If we pull off another win like the one I’m planning- Vendetta, forget everything we knew about the game. Forget senseless, purposeless wars. Forget ‘won’t identify with it.’ Forget groups, forget even Town Halls. I *do* want a war that has a purpose, or else it’ll burn out eventually.”

I saw him startle again and I interrupted him. “It won’t turn anyone off! Please, Listen!” I leaned in, and told him the hastily cooked up ‘Plan C.’ Top to bottom. Beginning to End. It wasn’t much. I made up half of the plan as I went along, and hoped I could hold it all in my head long enough to get to my notebook and scribble it down. But the pieces were mostly there already, albeit just through normal operations. All I’d done was looked around at what I already had in place, and clicked the plan together.

By the time I was done explaining, though, he looked shocked. He was frozen in place, eyes not even focusing on me as he ran the scenario through his head, and all its implications, or possibly just imagining what it would be like. I could see the goosebumps rising on his short sleeved shirt.

“What do you think?” I asked, nervously. He had a good grasp of human motivation. Of what made people tick. I knew it would make him tick, too. I felt a little dirty doing it, using his own tricks against him. But this was where our revolution was, now that things had started going a little sideways. “If there’s one thing that unites humanity- it isn’t even democracy, or suffering personal or symbolic losses, honor, justice, kindness, persistence, tolerance, a common threat or enemy, or whatever else people say it is. It’s just that one thing.”

“Just when I think I have you figured out…” he said, and then he began to laugh. “Yes. Yes! Fuck yes, let’s do it!” He threw an arm into the air. “Yes!” The people who were watching us seemed to notice his joy.

“Get ‘Jules’ to start work,” I said. “In the meantime,” I paused, trying to stress this part without the use of facial expressions. “You do see why I need to keep the hostages alive, don’t you? We can’t run these plans without them.”

“Absolutely,” he agreed. “Won’t harm a hair on any of ‘em. The more the merrier. Seriously, this is *so much better*.”

Well, at least that was one thing sorted.

Now to get some of the people started on Plan B, and to visit some of the hostages.

Chapter 26: Let The Games Begin

&amp;#x200B;

*One More Round!* That’s what Mal’Ava Nasis told Zachary O’Connor when she saw him hard once more. She still couldn’t believe it. They had gone for hours that night, fallen asleep, and Zachary was still as ready as he was hours before. She had lost track of how many water bottles lay scattered about the room, as well as bottles holding some orange and yellow liquid, which seemed to recharge Zachary within minutes. He pounded her relentlessly, not seeming to lose strength even after how many times he came inside of her.

One more round had turned into two, then three, and before she knew it, her legs completely gave out under her. There she lay, on his bed, flat on her stomach, and not an ounce of dignity left as the Human used her to his content. *And she was loving every last moment!* She was always mocked by her peers for who she was. Her breasts were smaller than the others. She ranked the lowest in her class when it came to testing, even if it was only by a few points. She came from a rural farmworld, while nearly all of her colleagues hailed from major city worlds. Her one saving grace was that she was top in her class when it came to physical testing.

No boy had ever taken an interest in her before coming to Earth. Even upon arriving, her experiences on Earth made her think that was never going to change. But everything *had* changed. Now she was experiencing bliss and euphoria the likes of which she never imagined. She was no longer a virgin country girl, who was only notable for her above average physical fitness level. The fact that a *Human Male* was able to do this astonished her.

None of the videos she ever watched showed men with such enthusiasm, passion, vigor, or stamina. Not Shil boys, not Nighkru, Helkam, or Rakiri. And she had watched *a lot* of videos on the latter, with how strong and powerful they could be because of their size. But even they only lasted one round. With Zachary? She had honestly lost count, but it was more than she’d ever seen a male go. Even with the help of certain pills and gels, no male could ever stay hard for nearly as long as Zachary did.

“Guh!” Mal’Ava whimpered out as Zachary grabbed her hair and yanked her head up. He shifted her head so she could look him in the eye. Despite her exhaustion, her eyes, like his, were filled with animalistic lust. Neither of them wanted this to end, and it wouldn’t end. Not until Zachary had fully expended himself, and she knew not when that would be.

“Only one more round?” Zachary asked, an evil grin on his face as he slid into her cum filled pussy, his cock covered in her cream as he thrusted into her hard, wringing yet another orgasm from her sore body. Her arms and legs had not the strength to keep her up, and even her cunt was feeling sore from the relentless fucking she was receiving. “Seems like three, n-now!” He grunted, expelling his seed into her for the third time this morning.

“Don’t stop, Daddy! Please!” Mal’Ava begged, which made Zachary’s smirk get wider.

“Daddy? Where did you learn that from?” He growled, bringing his lips to her ear, and biting down softly on it.

“P-porn!” Mal’Ava moaned out. “I learned it from porn!” Zachary simply chuckled in response.

“So the sweet innocent farm girl gets corrupted only after a year of being on Earth?” Zachary whispered, thrusting himself into her once more. “I guess we really are a bad influence, aren’t we?”

“N-no! Not at all! Not bad at all!” she moaned, her eyes rolling into the back of her head as more pangs of pleasure shot up her spine. But before they could go any further, there was a knock on the door.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------

“She still hasn't responded back to me, and it's been over an hour,” Sergeant Teloma explained, looking at the time.

“Yeah, it's an hour before noon, and she still hasn’t reported back yet,” 1st Lieutenant Delka said. “How the fuck can they still keep going? I’ve seen the porn too, but Empress, I can’t believe it!”

“We can always send the Pod out now to go pick her up,” Sergeant Enilia suggested.

“We might have to. We need her back here soon, we’re getting ready to deploy back to our zone in a few days,” Delka pointed out. Sergeant Teloma just sighed.

“I’ll have Draxis grab a few of the boots and go get her,” she said, before picking up her omnipad.

“Hold on just a minute!” Enilia said, raising her hand, a grin forming across her features. “How about we have a friendly wager, first?”

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**20 Minutes Later…**

CPL Draxis: ""Uh, Sergeant?"" 

SGT: ""What is it, Corporal?"" 

CPL: ""You're not going to believe this, but...they're still going at it."" 

SGT: ""You stay there until the LT tells you to come in. If you fuck this up for me you'll be on double PT for a month."" 

CPL: ""...for you, Sergeant?"" 

SGT: ""I have a bet with Sergeant Enilia. Fifty credits if the LT isn't back before noon. Do not fuck this up for me."" 

CPL: ... 

CPL: ""I wonder if there might be a bottle of Red Grain waiting under my bunk if I get there at 1300..."" 

SGT: ""You're a cheap whore, Corporal."" 

CPL: ""Are you saying there might be two bottles then, Sergeant?"" 

SGT: ... 

CPL: ""Well?"" 

SGT: ""Sorry, sending another message."" 

SGT: ""Think you can keep her out until 1400? Enilia just went double or nothing."" 

CPL: ""I think I feel a twinge in my ankle, Sergeant."" 

SGT: ""Good woman. I'll make sure those two bottles find their way back to your bunk.""

\------------------------------------------------------------------------

“Who the fuck is knocking on the door?” Zachary growled, pissed off at being interrupted.

“Oh, Goddess!” Mal’Ava sighed, bringing a hand to rub her face. “I asked Sergeant Teloma earlier to send a pod later to help me back to base, but that was over an hour ago.”

“Wait, why do you need help getting back to base?” Zachary asked, raising an eyebrow, and not caring to hide his grin. Mal’Ava simply glared at him before raising her legs and wrapping them around his back, forcing him to resume his previous action. She moaned as he slid back into her and continued thrusting. “Still feeling frisky, huh?” Zachary whispered into her ear.

“They can wait a minute!” Mal’Ava said, grinning eagerly at him. “Now show those girls out there what you can do! I want them to hear it all, Daddy!” Her eyes were filled with nothing but pure, primal lust, and it only made Zachary harder.

“With pleasure!” Zachary happily obliged her, and began a campaign that sent her screaming at the top of her lungs, curses and compliments in both English and Shil making the Marines outside turn all different shades of blue. Her fingers gripped the edges of the bed for dear life, and her vision filled with stars as the Human atop her used her ‘til his libido was satisfied.

“DON'T STOP!” Mal’Ava shrieked, her legs shaking like leaves in the wind. Her omnipad beeped again, and again, but she didn’t care. Whatever it is could wait until later, because right now she was having the time of her life!

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Knowing grins filled the meeting room, all focused on 1st Lieutenant Mal’Ava Nasis. She was the first in her unit to achieve something most of them could only dream of. She not only lost her virginity, she lost it to a *Human*. Mal’Ava just sat in the beanbag chair, legs shaking, a look of contentment on her face as her Podmates looked at her in envy.

“So you finally lost your virginity, huh, Mal’Ava?” 1st Lieutenant Delka said, grinning wide at the woman. “Not only did you lose it, I’d say the Human took it out in the alley, beat the fuck out of it, and shot it in the head.” She laughed, as did some others at Mal’Ava’s predicament.

“I still can’t believe it. In all my years in the Marines, never once have I seen any Marine have to physically carry another, anywhere outside of a bar. Then Corporal Draxis has to haul your ass back here because you can’t even stand up straight!” Sergeant Teloma said. “Either way, I think congratulations are in order for you, Ma’am. First time I’ve ever seen a woman so thoroughly fucked she couldn’t walk or even stand in formation.”

“Yeah, the Company Commander wasn’t exactly happy about that, Mal’Ava!” Delka pointed out. “Then again, I could see the jealousy written across her face, too.""

“From what I’ve heard in some reports, that tends to be the fate of many girls who sleep with Human men,” Sergeant Enilia said. “Lotta girls can’t walk straight the next day, or day after. One poor girl even failed a run because she got dicked down too hard.” Many of the Marines in the room laughed at that, while others remained jealous.

“You sure you aren’t willing to share him, Ma’am? If what the Privates told me was true, you were going when they got there, and spent nearly an hour waiting outside before they were able to come in,” Corporal Draxis said. “A man with stamina like that? He could put us *all* down for a day.”

“No shit, especially since we’re about to go back *there!*” Teloma shuddered. Their block of leave was about over, and tomorrow would be their last day of relaxation before going back to the red zone known as ‘Palestine’. Most of the Marines in the room *hated* that region with a passion. Seeing children throw everything from bottles of gasoline with flaming rags, to children and men strapping explosives to themselves and blowing up checkpoints had left many of them in a bad state of mind.

“Yeah, instead of men trying to fuck us, they’ll be trying to fuck us *up*,” Draxis growled.

“Yeah, are you sure he isn’t willing to have a few more women join in the bedroom? If all he needs is some water to keep him going, I’ll carry a whole fucking drum of it myself if it means getting laid,” Enilia laughed, as did some of the others. Mal’Ava just shook her head, her goofy expression not leaving her face.

“Never going to happen,” Mal’Ava said, rubbing her sore thighs, hoping to get some feeling back in them. “The circumstances regarding our relationship are the only reason I got as far as I did. The same doesn’t apply for any of you, I’m afraid.”

“Shame,” Delka muttered to herself. “Still though, I hope you got your fill, because it's right back to the shit after tomorrow,” she told Mal’Ava.

“He certainly filled me real good,” Mal’Ava chuckled. “There’s still plenty of him inside as we speak. Human virility is truly amazing, and seemingly unending. If he was a Shil boy, there’s no way I wouldn’t be pregnant right now!” Mal’Ava said, looking at the group of Marines around her, who all turned a deeper shade of blue.

“W-wait, so there’s still...some of it, you know?” one of the Privates in the room squeaked out, prompting Mal’Ava to eye her with a devilish grin.

“Plenty,” Mal’Ava began. “If you want, I can share some with you? Might have to go in *real deep* though, he pumped a lot inside me! Or what about you, Delka?” Mal’Ava turned to her and winked, eliciting a saucy grin from the other Lieutenant.

“Maybe later, Mal’Ava, but not right now,” Delka said, an equally lewd look on her face. “For now, we need to worry about getting our shit ready for another local year of turox shit over in that shithole called ‘The Middle East’.”

“Killjoy!” Mal’Ava said, rolling her eyes.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“Fucking Interior cunts!” the Commanding General hissed as she watched the video from the restaurant. Once again, more trouble erupted while the recruits were enjoying a night on the town. Once again, it was recorded, and now the Interior Training Center was bitching up a storm over what had happened. The Marine Recruits claimed self defense, and the video showed just that. The Interior, however, was claiming the incident was proof that the Humans harbored resentment against the Imperium and should be drummed out of the military.

When they showed the video to the Interior Academy’s Commanding General, the woman huffed and puffed, but ultimately couldn’t refute what the video evidence had shown. Her girls were clearly in the wrong, and the sight of Humans going out on dates with a multitude of species, Shil’vati included, put an end to thoughts of dissent among their ranks. At least, to their knowledge. The veteran Humans still weren’t fond of the Imperium, something many of the DI’s managed to at least partly figure out.

But openly traitorous activity or subterfuge wasn’t observed in the slightest. Some animosity at worst, but those problems had mostly been resolved. Before the woman ended the call, however, she pointed out that the next graduating class for the Interior Academy was approaching the time for their Final Training Exercise. She claimed to also have heard about the Humans' proficiency in training, and wanted to “even the score” after the restaurant fight. She requested that cadres 1-10 be used in a simulated training exercise to test urban combat proficiency. After saying she’d send the details over, she cut the connection.

The Commanding General, as well as many of the officers and DI’s, flew into a storm of curses and insults over what the Interior wanted of them. For the last decade, whenever they grabbed Marine Recruits, whether they were halfway through, or on their own Final Exercise, they always lost to the Interior. Whenever the Interior didn’t feel like bullying the militia into the exercises, they’d grab recruits from The Citadel. Every single time, they lost, and they lost *hard*. Woman-portable AA, Exos, gunships, MCU’s; you name it, they had it.

It was infuriating watching all of their recruits constantly get beaten down and embarrassed by those cunts. But now there was another factor in the equation. Combat veterans, specifically *Human* combat veterans, most of whom had fought the Shil’vati when they arrived, and undoubtedly had to face down those same odds with barely anything. Their performance was unmatched by any of the previous cycles, and it gave hope to the Officers and DI’s alike that they’d be able to embarrass them for a change.

There was a week until that exercise would begin, a week in which they’d be having the cadres go over the fine details and layout of the town. 1-10 were going to be defending, while the Interior was going to attack. They had entrusted the Humans to help get the cadres, even those from 6-10, up to snuff on the details. Although they raised more than a few eyebrows when the Humans had asked for blueprints of the sewer and tunnel networks underneath the town, as well as the rules about setting up traps and “tactically acquiring” enemy gear.

Major Mal’Ava had to explain that it basically meant stealing enemy gear. Luckily, there wasn’t anything in the regs against it, something that made many of the Humans a bit *too* happy upon hearing it. They had faith that the Humans would do something to pull through in the end, although Goddess only knew *what* they would do. But there was something else that had drawn their attention, although not widely known. A video that EDI Rayna had found while browsing a particular website and sought to share with her SDI’s.

“Turox shit!” snapped Ches’aka, the Helkam SDI for cadre 8, the only SDI who wasn’t Shil’vati, and one of the few DI’s present who wasn’t Shil’vati. She replayed the section of video that both baffled and aroused her simultaneously. In all her years, and the men she’d fucked, never had she seen a male, Helkam, Shil'vati, or otherwise, be brought to a second orgasm within the same hour. “Not even I’ve been able to do that before!”

“Magic Human Dick!” SDI Prisma mused aloud. “That’s what everyone’s been calling it since it became clear that Human men don't have the same limits as our own. Fucking a man or woman until they can’t move is *easy* for most of them, apparently.”

“It's funny you should mention that,” Major Delka said, smiling at Mal’Ava, who turned dark blue and scowled at her old friend. “A certain woman in here experienced such a thing once upon a time.”

“Don’t you dare bring that day up!” Mal’Ava squeaked. She remembered that day all too well, and as much as she loved it, many of her friends made fun of her for it. Delka just smiled deviously at her friend’s reaction.

“Well now we’ve just *got* to know what happened,” Captain Ov’Ari said, crossing her arms and leaning against the wall.

“Agreed,” SDI Pasani echoed.

“With pleasure,” Delka replied, ignoring the dagger-like stare from Mal’Ava as she began to retell the tale. “The first night that Mal’Ava and Recruit Zachary laid together, he fucked her so hard that the Pod we sent to escort her back to base had to *carry* her back.” The entire room erupted in laughter, making Mal’Ava turn blue again,  scowling even more intently at her old friend.

“No way, you’ve got to be fucking with us!” SDI Din’Asa said.

“No shit, I’m being serious here. The Pod I sent waited outside for nearly an hour as he fucked her senseless, and when he finally let them in the apartment, Mal’Ava tried standing up, only to collapse onto the ground. She couldn’t even stand in formation that day, much to the anger of the Commanding Officer. If I didn’t send those Marines to get her out of there, I don’t think she would’ve survived the Human’s insane libido.”

Again, the room erupted in laughter at the expense of Mal’Ava Nasis. Even Staff Sergeant Kolani couldn’t help but laugh, although she, too, had learned the power of the Human libido.

“She’s not wrong either,"" Kolani interjected. ""I've also been on the receiving end of his stamina. Suffice to say, the rumors of Human sexual prowess are not unfounded or exaggerated, especially not those who were former military. The latter arguably had the highest libidos on the planet.” She shook her head, thinking of everything that had occurred the day they arrived on Earth. “Just a damn shame there aren’t more like him. Our way of doing things made damn sure that wouldn’t happen.” She shook her head again, and the rest of the room realized what turn the conversation was going to take, unless someone intervened.

“So this Human in the video, is he the same one?” Ches’aka asked, looking back down at her pad and replaying the scene that made her feel inadequate.

“How can we tell? His face is blurred,” SDI Pasani pointed out.

“No, but I can hear his voice clear as ever, not to mention the scar on his chest,” Mal’Ava pointed out.

“So between you two, the two males he’s with in the video, and those cave scum he took on a date to that restaurant,” began Kollasa, the Rakiri DI from cadre 8, “Your boyfriend has racked up an impressive body count in his time here. Any chance he’s willing to sleep with a Rakiri as well?”

“Or a Triki?” asked Grilini, the sole Triki DI on the station.

“I’m honestly not sure, but I don’t believe so,” Mal’Ava replied. ""The only cadre members he’s taken interest in are men, something I know he has a preference for. As for the Nighkru, they resemble Humans similar to Recruit Anisa, another preference he has. He’s had numerous chances to ask other women, but he hasn’t. I just don’t believe he’s interested.""

“Shame,” Kollasa muttered. “I like a man with scars on him. Mark of a great hunter,” she mused.

“I don’t believe that any of the Humans who have scars on their bodies have good stories that come with them,” SDI Prisma said. “Two of the Humans in my cadre, Recruit Zachary included, are examples of that. You may find it attractive, but I don’t relish the thought of seeing men injured that way.”

“Or dying like that,” EDI Rayna pointed out. “Those here who’ve seen action on Earth know full well what I mean too.”

“Let’s not dwell on those memories,” Major Delka said. “I am curious though, Drill Instructor Rayna, where exactly did you find this video?”

“Just a site with a collection of videos on them,” Rayna murmured. “Nothing fancy or anything. I stumbled upon by pure chance. I downloaded it out of curiosity, and when I went back for a link, it was deleted.”

“Oh well, at least his face won’t be all over the net,” Mal’Ava said. “I believe we’ve spent enough time chatting, though. It seems you all have a very busy week ahead of you.”

That we do,” Ov’Ari sighed. “I’m just hoping those Humans can pull some magic out of their asses and stick it to those Interior cunts. I’m sick of hearing them run their mouths.”

“If what we’ve observed so far is any indication of the Humans’ tactical prowess, I don’t believe we have much to worry about.” With that, the Officers and DI’s got up, and went back to their duties, preparing their cadres for the hard days ahead.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“So this is what we’re dealing with,” Alistair Jones said, as he and the other Humans gathered around the blueprints positioned all over the table. Cadres 1-10, alongside some local militia forces, were tasked with defending a small town a few thousand miles away on the opposite continent. As such, they were given a few days to go over and plan their defense. Seeing what they were up against, the Humans had to get creative if they wanted a snowball's chance in hell of winning.

Tactical requisitioning of enemy gear was allowed. Setting up traps was allowed. Even going underground and setting up ambushes around the town’s streets was entirely allowed for the exercise. More than a few of them knew how to set up traps, and Alistair, White, Matherson, and even Victor were going over how to exploit the town’s layout to maximum advantage.

“No matter how you toss it, this fight is going to be a bitch,” William said, running a hand through his hair.

“Yeah, but we’re on the defensive here, and have superior numbers, and combat experience to work with,” Zachary pointed out.

“But they’ve got better gear than we do!’ Akio retorted. “Exo suits and dropships, as well as man-portable anti-air launchers! It’s going to be hell trying to work our way around this!”

“But we’ve got blueprints and layout of the whole town, including the tunnel and sewer networks, although the DI’s were baffled by us asking for that,” Matherson said.

“Shil’vati are claustrophobic as fuck. They hate tight spaces. They also aren’t very creative, or crafty when it comes to lying traps for the enemy to walk into. Them getting snared in Anisa’s ropes, and hung by their legs from a tree, is proof enough of that.” Zachary’s compliment made the Kenyan woman smile warmly at him in response.

“Always nice to know my work is appreciated.” Anisa said.

“Fair enough point, Yank; we did find this out during the First Contact War. You too Akio, you remember?”

“Indeed I do, although we did lose that fight,” Akio pointed out.

“Ah, but that’s the thing, we aren’t facing a full blown invasion force here,” Alistair argued. “I can see where he’s going here. They might have Exos and air cover, but there’s only one or two hundred of them at best. There’s 200 of us just in the cadres, plus the militia, which should be about the same number. We know the Interior cadets have man-portable AA, and most of us should know how powerful that shit is.”

“So we steal their weapons, and use them against them?” Elias asked.

“Exactly!” William said. “And with those of us here who are proficient enough marksmen, we can draw those units into ambushes, take them down, and grab their own gear to use against them. Luckily they only have a few Exos, which means each one we take down makes it easier for us.”

“And while I’d like to study these blueprints a bit longer, all that wire we acquired should make it easy for us to snare many of them. This isn’t counting all the other ideas me and Siva have to ruin their day *real* quick,” Anisa said.

“Also, take a look at this here,” Johan said, pointing to the power generators and pipes running through the town. “We can take advantage of the power network and pipes running under the streets. We can knock out the power right before we ambush them, and if I have enough time, possibly rupture the pipes under their feet.”

“Which would disorient them long enough that we could wipe out a patrol or severely maul them, before pulling back,” Victor said, putting the pieces together.

“While I doubt hacking can work, we can easily station people at the power boxes, and smash them when they come through those areas, and have people underground to manually cause the pipes to burst from overpressure, and have them rupture on the street.”

“Just asking, did you steal this idea from a video game?” Zachary asked, a small smile taking hold on his face as the Swede nodded his head up and down.

“Yep, although not nearly as bullshit as that game is. We can do this manually, and if we time it correctly, it can work.”

“Smart lad you are,” Alistair said, taking his pen over the plans, and marking down the ideas.

“We just gotta convince some of the Shil’vati or Rakiri to go down there though, just in case we need their strength to mess with the pipes,” Kaarine suggested. Now, everyone looked over at Victor, for obvious reasons.

“You fix things with your girlfriend, or what? Because Rakiri don’t seem to fear tight spaces as much as Shil’vati do, so we may need their help for this,” Fisher said. Victor just sighed before replying.

“We haven’t talked much recently. She’s still trying to convince me to date her friend, too, saying that she thinks I don’t find her attractive. I’m not sure if I can approach her and ask her this. Not alone, at least.”

“Ok then, how about that Rakiri that was chatting you and Johan up at the restaurant? She’s in cadre 7, we can go ask her,” Zachary suggested.

“No need to do that!” A voice came from behind, which made many of them jump. It was the same Rakiri they were talking about, Laleena. Her tail was swishing back and forth in amusement at startling the Humans.

“God damn, woman, can you not fucking do that?” William exclaimed,

“Still upset about our first encounter in the woods?” she said, looking down at the Australian. “I have to admit, you have some good reflexes for a Human.” A small smile tugged at her lips as she stared at him for a few more seconds.

“No way in hell, not interested,” William said firmly.

“Shame,” she replied, before looking down at the plans. “I was a militiawoman on my homeworld of Gurathu, so I have experience with stuff like this. You Humans certainly know what you're doing, and I believe the plan could work, if we do it right. However, if you don’t mind, I would like to add some ideas of my own.”

“Go ahead,” Alistair began. “We wouldn’t mind hearing the input from anyone who's got actual experience. What do you have in mind?”

“Well, in my experience, the Interior tends to have their heads up their own asses a lot. The vast majority come from noble households, and use their parents' money and standing to get a spot in the Academy. While I’ve seen some rather good Interior troops, most are rather lacking in skill.”

“So they're extremely cocky and only got to their position because they were born noble?” Fisher asked.

“Which means they might be easier to fool, and have them run into ambushes and traps,” Siva realized.

“Exactly. And since this exercise requires them to capture our headquarters in the town, and root out our positions, we can take full advantage of our situation. However, one of the ideas I have is going to require someone to act as…” She brought her hand up, waving it in the air, trying to come up with the word.

“Bait,” Anisa said. “You want someone to act as bait, to draw them in, and then ambush them when they think it's safe?”

“Something along those lines,” Laleena confirmed. “If we used a whole Pod, they may just wipe them out and move on. And since both sides are cleared to capture and interrogate enemy personnel, they may let their guard down and surround a lone combatant.”

“But that means risking one of our own to the mercy of the enemy,” Elias pointed out. “And there’s no guarantee we’d be able to save them if shit goes south.”

“And I also imagine that when you say use someone as bait, it implies one of us Humans, doesn’t it?” Matherson said.

“Yes, but I trust that your skills, combined with being able to lure the Interior where we want, can make sure that doesn’t happen. Given the disparity in equipment, we need to take full advantage of their arrogance, and make them think it’ll be easy.”

“It's easy for you to say, when tossing a single guy out to a bunch of horny nobles,” Zachary said.

“Still, we’ve got a few days to go over these plans with a microscope,” Alistair said. “Now, I’m not saying we do what you're proposing, but we need to look at every aspect of this operation. I know its been a while since I’ve planned out an operation like this, but I’m seeing a lot of possibilities here. I know this, though: we aren’t losing to a bunch of fucking rich kids with fancy gear,” he said firmly, looking around at all the heads nodding in agreement with what he said.

“Damn straight!” Anatoly said, the quiet Russian living up the reputation of speaking only sparingly.

“I’ll be damned if we lose to some punk-ass kids we beat in a bar brawl,” William said.

“I’d say it's time we give them the beating their parents never gave them, and show these bitches just what we can do!” Zachary said. The Humans beamed at each other as they all reached mutual agreement on the upcoming exercise.

“So, Siva, Anisa,” William started, a wide grin forming across his face. “Just how much of that wire did you manage to *acquire?”* One thing was clear, the Humans were going to *enjoy this*!

\------------------------------------------------------------

Everything was finally finished. Everyone was sitting in their positions, more focused now than they had ever been in their entire lives. Every trap, every ambush point, every sniper's nest, every escape route and kill zone, had been checked and rechecked. Days of nonstop study and training with their fellow cadre members all led to this moment. Their targets were fast approaching, arrogance flowing from them in the way they carried themselves, blissfully unaware of the hell they had just stumbled onto.

Seconds went by. They all held their breath, waiting for the Interior forces to get close enough for them to launch their attack. They crossed the threshold, and the orders finally came down. 

*“Start the clock everyone!”* Alistair called into the comm channel. The code word was given, the attack started, war cries screamed over the comm channel, and all hell broke loose. 

*“WHO DARES WINS!”* 

""HAKKAA PÄÄLE!"" 

""GOTT MIT UNS!"" 

""OORAH!"" 

""NI SHAGU NAZAD!"" 

""BANZAI!""

# Chapter 45: Maybe We Overreached

Third Fleet Command Ship, CNS Olympia

“What happened to them?” Admiral Petrov had been distracted.

“The psi-corp agents that we sent to retrieve the financial information from the cadet were found dead by intelligence.” Rear Admiral Anderson stated.

“How? Is the cause of death known?” Petrov stopped what he was doing.

“We’re unsure. Intelligence has not released the autopsy reports. It strongly implies a counter espionage team was working in or near the academy.”

“No, the cadet did it.” Petrov shook his head.

“With respect sir, he’s recognized as a level three or four telepath. We had three level fours and a level five telepaths on sight. Their combined strength should’ve overwhelmed his barriers.”

“And yet they are dead now.”

“Do you want me to begin working on another operation?”

“Not at this time. Your dismissed.” Petrov sank back in his chair.

“Sir.” Anderson saluted and walked out of the room.

Petrov looked at the screen and shook his head. He had ordered this operation and once again blown up. That accursed cadet struck back against them again. He shook his and decided to distract himself with work. A hint of worry was clouding the admiral’s thoughts.

Monday 14:30, Co-Ed Dorm

The group made it back from lunch. John egged Thomas on but didn’t accept a free meal. He did accept a free drink though. Alice was tired and was sleeping in their bedroom. John was watching the Ocho occasional as he was sitting at his terminal, RC Car racing was the current competition being televised. 

John was doing some background research on Admiral Petrov. After a while of doing that, he shifted gears to try and find where he was hiding a large portion of his wealth. The one common thing all of those that are wealthy and in power shared was a habit of hiding money. In his time as a field agent, he had spent his fair share of days researching financial activities and all of them had slush funds they wanted to store off the record money into.

Petrov was no different, though in all fairness John was no stranger to this either. He was on the right track trying to hunt this slush fund down. He couldn’t go after the known accounts, but John, not able to get his chunk of flesh, was willing to settle for most of the slush fund. He started the VI routine to track the money. He logged off and laid down on the couch.

Just as he did that a call came in.

“Afternoon Rich.”

“Hi John, sorry for the delay in responding I haven’t been home in a while. Congratulations on your first year. And obviously for getting engaged.” Richard Lief was smiling.

“Thank you. She’s asleep in the other room. The second year is busy as hell.”

“It only gets busier, for you especially.” Rich was smiling.

“I’ve heard that. The med students probably have it worse than command in terms of homework.”

“That’s not far off, but command has the weight of the world that you have to bear. I’m sure classes are already proving that.”

“That they have.” John smiled and nodded.

“Have the two of you set a date?”

“Not yet, we’re probably going to hammer most of the details out over Thanksgiving.”

Richard was looking incredibly happy. “Well, I’m happy for you. I’m not sure whether or not any of your siblings or your mother can attend.”

John winced slightly at that. His family dynamic was not a normal one and he didn’t feel a part of the family as much as Richard thought the family ought to be.

“Richard, I really do appreciate everything you’ve done for me. But I’ve been aware for well over a decade now that your wife and kids didn’t want me around. It’s ok though. That message was more for you than anyone else.”

“John, I’m sorry they didn’t treat you as well as you deserved to be treated.”

“Don’t worry about it. Water under the bridge. Your heart was in the right place. I’ll keep in touch and let you know of any updates or dates we set.”

“Thank you, son. Have a great year and it was great to hear from you.”

The call ended. John never had anything against Richard, his heart was always in the right place. He felt compelled and responsible for taking care of John when the ship he was on serving on located aftermath of the massacre on Mendes 8. The main issue with the adoption of John was Richard’s lack of communication with his wife and kids about adding another kid to the family. 

John got up and stretched, then decided to lay down on the couch and take a nap. He fell asleep pretty quickly. He was only asleep for about an hour when Alice woke him up by kissing him.

“Hey there sleepy head, let’s go down to the lounge.” Alice was smiling.

Lounge 16:00

Kevin and Thomas were playing cornhole when Alice and John walked in.

“Yo, how’s it going?” John said.

“Good, I’m kind of bored. Like almost missing school.” Thomas said.

“Shut your whore mouth you dickhead.” Andern was stunned at what he heard.

John and Alice both shook their heads. Alice sat by the other girls. John took a seat on the couch. He pulled up his tablet and was checking things. The VI program he kicked off that morning had found the admirals secret accounts. He loaded up another VI to transfer seventy five percent the admiral’s slush fund. He transferred the account details between VIs and started the new one. 

“It’s Stromboli night here guys.” John said.

“Love me that stuff.” Kevin said.

“I have no words.” Alice was highly critical of any Italian or Italian-American food they served here. 

John convinced Alice to play a game against Kristin and Andern in cornhole. They ended up playing three games before they broke for dinner. Alice and John were up two games to one. The group of friends headed to the cafeteria and sat down after getting their food.

John looked at his tablet before starting to eat dinner. The VI had finished reducing the good admiral’s slush fund to about twenty-five percent it’s original amount. The money would be cleaned in thirty to thirty-six hours. He keyed in a couple things to the tablet to have some of that money be invested and the rest to be stored in unmarked credit chits.

“So, any fun plans this evening or we just hanging out in the lounge?” Nathan asked.

“Got a call I need to take after dinner, but when that’s over that sounds like a pretty good plan to me.” John said after taking a bite of food.

“What’s the call about?” Alice looked surprised.

“Intelligence needed to talk to me about something. Probably related to that mess in the spring.” John looked unconcerned.

“Think something else was going on?” Andern asked this with a mouth full of food.

“Ok, shut your mouth until there’s no food in there. Would they actually do that?” Kristin was shaking her head.

“When isn’t there something going on? Rich people with power, which most fleet admirals are, are loath to admit their mistakes. I wouldn’t be surprised if they were starting something again.” John shrugged. “I am not going to lose any sleep over it.”

The group bounced around from topic to topic. Study plans were lined for the foreseeable future. Everyone agreed that it was going to be brutally busy until fall break. Where they were going was also brought up. John let the group know about a couple different places in the Florida Keys that were up for rent.

“So which place has the detached in-law suite?” Andern asked.

“The rest of the place could be on fire or a hot mess and that’s the only thing that would matter to you, wouldn’t it?” Nathan asked.

Andern just nodded in affirmative in response to that.

“Well, I’ll get the place booked within a week or two. Let me know what works for y’all.” John stood up and grabbed his tray. “Heading to take that call. Cya in a bit.”

17:45 Secure Communications Room

“Director, good evening.”

“Evening John. Well, none of this will come as a surprise to you but the officers that attempted to assault you were third fleet assets.”

“Any electronic records of the order from Petrov?” 

“There’s no paper trail. Good thing you extracted the details.” LeCroix shook his head.

“So, nothing we can crucify him with then.”

“Correct.”

“Well, win some and loose some. The psi-corps aren’t going to try anything funky now that four of their members are dead. And Petrov himself will likely be shitting bricks knowing he just messed up.”

“I’ll let you know if anything else comes up.”

“Roger that. Have a good one director.”

John got up and left the room. When he was about to leave the communications office when he heard someone ask for him. John turned around.

“Cadet, you have another call for you. Same room will work.”

“Hey, perfect timing.” John gave the officer an awkward thumbs up.

John turned around and went back into the room. He sat down at the terminal and accepted the call. An image of Admiral Petrov appeared.

“Can’t say I wanted to see you again.” John crossed his arms.

“Where’s the money?”

“You’d have to elaborate. I had four telepaths try to kill me the other day. I’m not good at remembering things as well as I did before. I do recall this would constitute a violation of our little agreement.”

“I don’t enjoy repeating myself.”

“I checked the account list that intelligence had on you lot this morning and all the money was there. Was damn tempted to just nuke your asses again but I had orders not too. So, I didn’t.”

“I’m not going to ask again cadet.”

“Good, so we’re clear that I didn’t touch the money.” John typed into the terminal and pulled up the balances on all the accounts that were affected by the original VI attack on the leadership of third fleet. “As you can see the money is still there.”

“I’m not talking about those accounts.”

John shook his head. Internally he was laughing like a megalomaniac super villain. “What accounts? This is the list of accounts I have. I don’t have any others.”

“I know it was you.”

“Are we going to continue this stupid circular argument? I don’t have any other lists of any other accounts. I’ve been ordered to stand down.  Do you realize how fucking hard it is to even get one new account? Trust me when I saw it’s a pain in the ass to track down.”

That was a bald-faced lie. John’s VI that he programmed can do in hours what would take a normal agent days to track down. But the good admiral here wasn’t aware of all the tools John had access too. Or what tools he was willing to implement.

“I’m going to ask you one more time…”

John interrupted. “If you’re going to ask where your fucking money is then the answer is the same as I told you the last four fucking times you asked it. Look, I’d love to claim credit for taking shit from you. Seriously, I would take ownership of doing that since your overall douchebaggery is generally annoying to me. But once again, I… DID… NOT… TAKE… YOUR… FUCKING… MONEY… Is that clear enough for you or do I need to draw you a picture?

“Cadet, if I find out you did this, I will hurt you.”

“Careful with the threats admiral.” John’s tone of voice and appearance changed. “If you try to hurt anyone that I care about, I will make it my life’s mission to watch you suffer before you beg me to end your wretched existence.”

John ended the call. He flung open the door and headed to the lounge. He sent a message to LeCroix that the two had exchanged insults and threats. And that apparently some of his hidden accounts were absconded with.

Lounge 18:15

“You look pissed.” Andern not so subtlety stated.

“Traded threats. If that asshole even looks in my direction again, I’m going to fly into a…” John caught himself before he finished the sentence. “Never mind, best y’all not know where I’m going with that.”

“Done and done.” Kevin said laughing.

“Yeah, if shit goes down, I’m running with you. True you seem to be a magnet for bullshit, but I like my survival rates near you.” Thomas said as he tossed a bag.

“What he said.” Jessica agreed.

“Let’s hope things don’t progress to that point. That’d be pretty bad actually.” John said as he sat down

The group continued their chat from dinner about fall break. Everyone liked the larger house; an added bonus was it had a huge dock and wasn’t that far from a reef. That meant good snorkeling and possibly a whole lot of fresh fish to cook and eat. John booked the house. 

“Thomas, does your boyfriend want to come with us to fall break?” John asked. “House is booked too by the way.”

“He probably would, mark him down as a yes, but I’ll find out by tomorrow and let you know.”

“Cool. Once you let me know I’ll get flights booked.”

“No funny business.” Jessica glared at him.

“Fine.” John was pouting a little. 

Third Fleet Command Ship, CNS Olympia

“Intelligence believes the Alliance was responsible for the cyber-attack sir. It appears the cadet is in the clear, kind of.” Admiral Anderson shook his head.

“Clarify please.” Petrov wasn’t happy with the news.

“The VI the alliance agents used was most likely originally programmed by Lief, but it was a much older version of it and wasn’t nearly as sophisticated as the one they used recently.”

“So, from the information we just received the cadet was not the one that was responsible for liquidating those accounts.” Petrov was rubbing his forehead. “I threatened him not an hour ago.”

“That was, to be frank, unwise sir.” Anderson sank back into his chair.

The terminal in front of Petrov beeped a message had been sent to him. Petrov looked at it for a moment then shared it on the large screen to the right of Admiral Anderson.

“That’s a list of our…” Anderson drifted off.

“Anonymous sender, but we both know who it really came from. It seems the young cadet wasn’t bluffing. I filtered the list right now and there are three hundred fifty people that are connected out to a third cousin of mine.”

“Jesus Christ.” Anderson had seen his wife and children’s names on the list.

“Cancel all plans for any retaliation against the cadet. Let the other fleets know, he’s off limits.” Petrov shook his head.

“Sir? Are you sure? He’s just a single cadet.”

“Anderson, you haven’t received all the debriefs I have regarding this one. We can assume his telepathic abilities were grossly underreported. His intelligence is off the charts, which is matched by his adaptability and physical attributes. And he is absolutely vicious bastard if he’s pushed.”

“Why the hell is he in the academy?”

“Naval Intelligence thought it’d be better if he were an officer and not a secret agent. They were concerned with promoting him.”

Anderson was rubbing his forehead. “I’ll make sure to let them know.”

“Good, I’ll be sending Director LeCroix notification that at a minimum third fleet will take no more action against the cadet and are strongly suggesting the other fleets do the same.”

Admiral Anderson collected himself and then stood up. Just before he was about to leave the office he stopped and turned toward Petrov.

“Sir, what are we going to do when he graduates?”

“Imagine what he’d do if we set him up to die and he doesn’t die?” Petrov shook his head as he asked the hypothetical.

“I’d rather not sir.” Admiral Anderson turned around and headed to his room. He had some communications to send out and three operations to cancel. The door closed behind him.

“I doubt God himself could stop him from the reaping he’d sow.”

22:00 Co-ed Dorm

Alice and John just got back to their room. They were sitting on their couch together looking at possible venues for their wedding. John was trying to convince Alice that they needed to settle on the number of guests first because that ultimately determines what venue they could host things at. That suggesting flew right over her head.

“I’m just saying, hosting the reception at a place that seats a thousand when only two hundred are present is overkill and wasteful.”

“But what if it’s a better place though?”

“I feel like this is the second circular conversation I’ve been in today.”

Alice looked at him. “Are you really out of Intelligence?”

John grunted a small laugh. “I am out, but I will always be an asset of sorts. It cuts both ways though.”

“So, no operations while we’re on vacation again?”

“Well, there shouldn’t be any but since I’m so fucking awesome you never know.”

Alice started to snort then laughed at John. She finished that with a punch in the shoulder. “I love you, but we really do need to work on your modesty.”

“I am the most modest person known to mankind.”

“Riiiight…” Alice rolled her eyes; she was clearly not convinced.

The couple pivoted back to the wedding discussion. There seemed to be a growing consensus that the wedding ceremony itself would be a pretty private affair, limited to under two hundred or so people. The reception would be much larger.

This talk continued for about thirty minutes more when Alice decided she needed to take a shower. John logged into his terminal and a message came in for him.

“Evening Director. Was about to head to sleep.”

LeCroix was smiling. “Impressive counter op son.”

John shrugged. “Empty the slush fund of a corrupt asshole, put the fear of god into them, finally convince one fleet to stop its shit, put a few coins into my pocket. Yeah, I’d call it a good day.” 

“Yeah, about that last bit.”

“Oh yeah, where are my manners. Here’s the location of the credit chits. I held back a ten percent cut for expenses and ‘emotional distress.’” John air-quoted the last bit. “And I did not intend on holding all of that money to myself. Just wanted to say that.”

Director LeCroix laughed. “Received confirmation. The second and fourth fleets have agreed to pull their ops against you. No word yet on the first fleet. Keep your head on a swivel just in case.”

John ended the call and walked into the bedroom smiling. It ended up being a pretty good holiday weekend. It was time to get into the normal routine again though. There were new goals to look forward too. Maybe people wouldn’t actively try to sabotage his fledgling career. John just smiled at that. Too damned many people wanted to see him fail. His career was going to be one challenge after another. That suited him well enough. He wanted to be there and smile at all the people that desperately wish him to fail.

**John Isaacs- Agent, Fae/Demon Specialist NYC**

Hello fellow SIA employees. For those of you who don't know me, I'm Agent John Isaacs of the NYC SIA branch. This week Agent Fuller and I were flown in for a case, and just this night had unprecedented luck: A Demon, a Succubus to be precise, willing to work with us at SIA. As part of our Contract with her, we need to provide at least one being per day for spiritual consumption through sexual intercourse as a requirement of her diet. This is loosely covered in the NSDC, Section 105-r. 

Risk is deemed minimal to nonexistent. We have studied her in a controlled environment and found no permanent or negative effects on her partner, a civilian volunteer who had previously been used for sustenance and didn't know then that she was a Demon. We have also cross-checked the health and status of her prior partners across multiple species and stretching back at least five years. We found zero abnormalities or causes for concern. The Succubus thus far has avoided consuming twice from the same being within a month out of an abundance of caution, though we've separately determined that 7 days should be reasonable for a full recovery. 

Said Demon lives and works in this city as a civilian and is thus classified as a Being-I-5: Non-Signatory who is highly integrated into American society, privy to a small amount of Classified information relating to herself and other members of her own species, and determined to be a non-threat. This classification may change in the future. 

(edit: She has just agreed to follow *all* lawful commands by Agents and SIA employees in order to help us, in accordance with NSDC 12-5A, F and C3 for a Classified Situation. Do not abuse her gesture of goodwill, or HR and I will hear about it.)

Please keep in mind that the Succubus may soon work at SIA as a part-time Species Consultant. I ask that you treat her situation and dietary needs with the same respect and care that other species and employees do for you under the NSDC here at SIA. Furthermore, the Succubus would like to keep her species and status a secret from friends, family, and the general public in order to maintain her civilian life. Which we've agreed to uphold. Punishment for endangering or threatening her in any way will be determined by myself or HR.

I have included Julie from HR to maintain a respectful and productive environment for this discussion. The Succubus has not listed any reservations or preferences for sex, gender, faction, or species, so all employees at Classified Level 1 status or higher qualify. If you would like to volunteer, or have specific needs, please privately message me or Julie. I also ask that only beings who are not currently in relationships, or those with written, *explicit* consent from their partners, sign up. 

Attached below is a photographic reference and list of do's and don'ts we have thus far compiled for social interactions and these Contracted Liaisons.

**Replies:**

**Andy Wellbach - IT Systems Coordinator CHI**

Hold up. you're telling us every day someone has to have sex with a Succubus and get their soul eaten!? Is this an April Fool's Joke? Did you finally get in over your head with a Contract (@)JIsaacs? I'm finding this hard to believe.

&amp;#x200B;

**Sullivan Andrews - Research, Biology Specialist CHI**

Assuming this isn't a Charlie prank: (@)JIsaacs, before I consider getting near the Succubus, what's her kill count. Over or under 25? 

&amp;#x200B;

**Felicia Cruz - Research, Fae Specialist, Hubert Group CHI** 

Fascinating. Judging by the photo she looks more like an Orphaned Fae. Besides this study, is it possible I could get a copy of her genetic code and a few hours of her time in the Lab soon? Assuming she's willing to do so, of course.

edit: Apologies if my message above wasn't clear, but I'm not willing to volunteer at this time.

&amp;#x200B;

**John Isaacs- Agent, Fae/Demon Specialist NYC**

(@)AWellbach, (@)SAndrews, No, everything's fine with my Contracts still. Disbelief is understandable given our prior data on Demons, but I stress that treating the Succubus as a normal Civilian is both reasonable and justified right now.

(@)FCruz, I may stop by the third floor with some additional information. Hope they have some cake left. I think Genetic code can be done, but I should probably ask the Succubus, SIA Legal, and the Biology teams for you first.

&amp;#x200B;

**Therese Fuller - Agent, Witch Specialist NYC**

(@)AWellbach. Everything's fine and it's not a joke. The Demon has been fully integrated into society her whole life, and she's under contract to help us. She only takes a small portion of the person's soul each time she feeds, little enough that it grows back within a week and is only noticeable to our Vitometers. We've done extensive testing, though we'd like to do even more with SIA employee permission. While Isaacs is the trusting sort, Agent Petrovich and I have our eyes on her, so don't worry.

(@)SAndrews, unlike every other Demon we've recorded, this Succubus has a kill count of 0. So, yes, under 25. Trust me, I was surprised as well.

edit: Yes, this will likely make the entire SIA Succubus Field Manual useless. We'll work with the DC Office to update and expand information as quickly as possible in a comprehensive manner. IMPORTANT NOTE: For safety's sake, treat it as useless only when meeting with this Succubus.

&amp;#x200B;

**Kim Navarra - Research, Senior Circle Specialist, Navarra Group CHI** 

Not sure what I'm allowed to talk about. But this could be a big, important study, and all the specialists are very excited up on the third floor. They're usually a grim bunch, not that I blame them. What little I saw from the Succubus on Friday, she seemed... nice? If very nervous. Understandable given her whole situation.

edit: I think they actually ordered a cake delivered to the third floor.

edit 2: I hear party music. (@)JCalloway, I want them to turn it down a little so I can concentrate, but I don't want to barge in and ruin the fun, please advise?

&amp;#x200B;

**Jeffry Adams - Interpreter - Elf, Orc, Troll Specialist CHI**

That photo was touched up, right? I know some Sup's are pretty as a general rule, but that's absurd. (@)JIsaacs, is this a prank/SIA-species preparedness drill? Some of the Dusk Elves still complain to me about that fire drill we had last year.

&amp;#x200B;

**Reese Cole - Medical Technician - Human, Vampire, Witch Specialist CHI**

(@)JAdams No, the photo isn't touched up. I think I saw her at a happy hour once a few months ago talking with a group of people. Seemed like coworkers? Never would have thought she was a Demon. Orphaned Fae, possibly distant Fae royalty even. Usually I'd expect a Demon in a public setting to be rearranging body parts in creative and awful ways.

(@)JIsaacs. That list of don't and limits for her is... short. Very short. That's kind of scary tbh. I'll probably pass for now.

&amp;#x200B;

**Liam Pool - Agent - Elf, Were Specialist, CHI**

So we're volunteering to feed our souls to a near-invincible humanoid tank? eyes.emoji Never a dull moment here in Chicago SIA HQ. LULZ.emoji

edit: I'm married anyway, so I'm going to observe this whole affair from a distance with polite disinterest.

&amp;#x200B;

**Charlie Es'tha - Researcher/Evidence Specialist - Evidence Morning Shift CHI**

I'm doing my hardest to hold back on memes. Working with her's a riot so far. 

edit: Well, I completely screwed something up. So I'm in the doghouses right now. Can confirm that Isaacs is serious about punishments.

edit 2: Stop bombarding me with questions! Everything's fine with regards to the Succubus. My fault not hers, and she didn't tear anyone's head off, verbally or physically.

&amp;#x200B;

**Andrew Neilson - Evidence Field Specialist - Evidence Evening Shift CHI**

(@)Isaacs, she didn't rip Charlie's head off after an hour of talking to them? Must have the patience of a saint. wink.emoji (I haven't forgotten that Christmas prank last year. I will get you back!)

&amp;#x200B;

**Layla C. Bord -  Researcher - Mental Specialist, Floor B6 CHI**

Hi everyone, I've just done a full mental evaluation of the Succubus Isaacs has Contracted. Her name's Lillian (Just messaged Isaacs, we can use her first name now), and she's very sweet. You have nothing to fear even if Isaacs' Contract is voided, and she's very accommodating with safe words and any anxieties you might have. heartemoji.emoji If you happen to meet her at HQ, treat her like a decent person and she'll do likewise. Lillian also happens to have a life that *doesn't* revolve around sex and she likes befriending people, so feel free to discuss non-Classified topics with her.

&amp;#x200B;

**Desha Thak’k Researcher - Portal Magic Specialist, Uv'Im Group CHI**

So Charlie was not pulling legs when they told me she was a Demon! That is incredible. I hope our first meeting wasn't a problem. I fainted in fear. Would she be okay with just kissing? (@)JIsaacs Does the spirit thing work with kissing? kissingfacingright.emoji kissingfacingleft.emoji

&amp;#x200B;

**Julie Calloway - Species Interrelations Specialist, Human Resources CHI**

(@)DThakk, Hi Desha, please send such questions and concerns privately to Isaacs. 

(@)RCole, yes the list is short, but we've been assured verbally by both Agents and the Succubus that her partners' needs and limits will take priority over hers. Please message me if you have further questions.

&amp;#x200B;

**Scott Christianson  Assistant Researcher - Blood Magic Specialist, Thomas Group CHI**

If it's not breaking any procedures to talk about this, I think I met her over the weekend to take some blood. Demon skin is legit impossible to pierce with any metal we've currently got, she had to help break the skin using her own claws. And she was naked the whole time but didn't seem bothered by it? That's the whole story. Really flirty, and legit the most attractive woman I've ever seen in my life.

I can't believe I'm writing this but I'm ok with volunteering next. nervous.emoji (@)JIsaacs (@)JCalloway Can there be Agents or some sort of oversight in another room in case something goes wrong? Or a binding circle if it gets out of control? magiccircle.emoji candle.emoji

&amp;#x200B;

**Julie Calloway - Species Interrelations Specialist, Human Resources CHI** 

Hi Scott, thanks for volunteering. Please message me and (@)JIsaacs for further discussion and instructions.

&amp;#x200B;

**Simon Petrovich - Agent, Vampire, Fae, Troll Specialist CHI**

Before everyone lets their hormones get the best of them, I'd like to stress the fact that Lillian is still a Demon. There is a massive difference in strength between her and us, so remain careful. Agent Fuller and I just had a run-in with a Classified Issue that had Isaacs order her to incapacitate both myself and Fuller to keep all of us alive. A task she accomplished in under two seconds in such a way that I'm typing this from my bed in Medical. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Therese Fuller - Agent, Witch Specialist NYC**

(@)SPetrovich, you baby. I have the black eye and more healing bone fractures than you do. angry.emoji  (@)JIsaacs, btw, we'll be in the conference room as soon as I can find my socks.

&amp;#x200B;

**Desha Thak'k - Researcher, Portal Magic Specialist, Uv'Im Group CHI**

I just spoke with Lillian again! (@)JAdams (@)SChristianson She is very attractive, indeed the photo does not do justice. She also gave me her phone number on a business card after she visually appraised my body while we talked, so I think she wants to meet me privately later. I'm not sure how to handle this, please advise? Should I dress up, do we meet for drinks after work this week? I'm still a little uncertain about American dating norms.

(@)SPetrovich don't be mean! she's probably very stressed and we're throwing a lot at her right now.

&amp;#x200B;

**Julie Calloway - Species Interrelations Specialist, Human Resources CHI** 

Hi Desha, thanks for potentially volunteering. Please message me and u/JIsaacs for further discussion and instructions on how to deal with this situation.

&amp;#x200B;

**Desha Thak'k - Researcher, Portal Magic Specialist, Uv'Im Group CHI**

Thank you! (@)SChristianson tell me how your meeting with her goes, as well as any tips you have for a successful date!

&amp;#x200B;

**John Isaacs- Agent, Fae/Demon Specialist NYC**

I'm getting a large number of private questions and messages. I'll try and answer all of them today and build some sort of schedule. Please be patient, as things are a little hectic right now, and this is not my main focus here in Chicago. 

As of right now, we're not taking Research or Field work requests. But if Lillian agrees, we will allow for Research to work with her on future exploratory projects at her discretion. Field will likely be more difficult.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I just want it to be known that Desha is a precious muffin. And Scott is braver than most Agents... Or maybe just more desperate. I don't know if government agencies use in-work social media apps, but I think this one should for my amusement.",/r/HFY/comments/p4uulr/demon_city_canon_side_story_iv/,27

*New Haven, Connecticut*

“So, how exactly did you survive that nuke then?” Cooper noted, looking at the armoured vehicle before 1 Section, and the man currently sitting in its turret. She reached for her tablet, waking K-9 Mark 2, as she had called it, back up. Sadly, she had not taken Tergelyx’s suggestion of calling it K-10.

“It's like drinking, you build up a tolerance. Sit next to as many campfires as I have, it’s no problem.” Sergeant Yates replied, smirking. The entirety of 2 Platoon were currently hanging around, waiting to receive orders. They sat in the shadow of the Chang Xueliang, a converted Fox-type that hovered ominously above the water, a long ramp up which soldiers marched being its only point of contact with the ground. 

“Real answers only.”

“Our poor old Warrior needed the gun fixing, and we got told by the mechanics to go all the way to Long Island for a new one. Had to abandon her after the nuke popped, but luckily we managed to avoid getting drafted as infantry.” Frayne popped his head on out of the driver’s hatch, filling in the answer since Yates obviously wouldn’t.

“I told you to stick to the script!”

“Fuck the script.”

“Alright everyone, listen up!” Sergeant Fletcher yelled, drawing everyone’s attention. She nodded towards Lt Faulder, who cleared his throat.

“Uhhh, morning. I’m, uhhh, well, Lieutenant Faulder. I’ll just, uhhh, the, briefing, I’ll…”

“This is going well, isn’t it.” Cooper whispered to Curtis, who let out a snort. Faulder pulled out a notebook, seeming to give up and just read from it anyway.

“So. Well. The Hekatians have, retreated, behind the Susquehanna Contamination Zone, to try, and, uhh, form a defensive line. The uhh, Air Force is, pounding them hard. They’re tired and understrength, they don’t even have barbed wire. On the other hand, we are going in with a division’s worth of infantry and armour, with the Russians loaning us artillery, and Americans and Europeans to our North. The Fox-types will be backing us up all the way. Every front is pushing, and we are part of the most powerful military force ever assembled. This is our chance to shine as a unit.”

“Thank you, Lt. If I can take this moment.” Sergeant Fletcher stepped up again, Faulder quickly deferring to her. “Aside from the obvious change of Lt, we have a new Section in our midst. Corporal Raxicarifallatorus, it’s leader, is the first Hekatian NCO in our brigade. This gives us a fair amount of prestige, for very good reason. Add what we did in New York, and it’s fair to say that 2 Platoon is getting close to a household name back home.  This means that every fuckup, every injury, every loss, *will* be noticed, and *will* mar us. Your families will be tracking what goes on. Your friends. People you’ve never met will be keeping an eye on you. It’s been a hard war so far, and it’s probably going to get harder, so don’t be slipping up. I know none of you would want to disappoint the Captain, and none of you will want to disappoint family either, so don’t let it happen. That’s all.”

Fletcher then stepped back, passing it on to Faulder.

“We load onto the Chang in 30 minutes. It will land near Baltimore, where we will then deploy to assault a Hekatian trench network. All goes well, we’ll spend just a few minutes in the contaminated area. Once the line is broken, we begin an advance on Pittsburgh, timetable expects us there in 3 weeks.”

“That’s 300 kilometres.” Lance Corporal Jolly, from 2 Section said, a note of concern in his voice.

“There’s been faster advances. It’s a big goal, but the Americans reckon they can launch an uprising when we get there and help us secure it, all we have to do is link up. Most Hekatian forces are to the north of us, and they’ll be facing the Americans, we’ll avoid the brunt, and cut off their retreat. Now, get to your vehicles and be ready.” With that, the soldiers began dispersing.

“Can’t tell if the Lt’s just bad, or the Sarge is so good she’d blow anyone out of the water.” Cooper noted, walking towards the Warrior.

“Eh, no point getting worked up. So long as he knows what he’s doing when it comes to combat, I don’t care about his speeches.”

“Fingers crossed.”

“Doesn’t help that the plan sounds batshit. 100 kilometres a week!”

“This girl can do 75 in an hour if we’re lucky. So long as you lot can keep up your end of the bargain, I think we can manage.” Sergeant Yates replied, grinning.

“The bargain?” Ivegbuna asked, slightly confused.

“You know, the deal that every unit makes with its transport. You kill things in our way, and in return, we get to have fun driving around!”

“Where did you find this guy, exactly?” Ivegbuna asked, Tergelyx opening the door for the rest of the unit to step through.

“In the bowels of hell.” Curtis grumbled, climbing inside.

*Las Vegas, Nevada*

“Never thought I’d drive my tank through the ruins of the Lucky 38.”

“That’s not actually it’s name, you know.” Weber replied, boredom in his voice.

“It’s the Lucky 38 to everyone under 30, Weber. When they rebuild it, they should just rename it.”

“If they rebuild it. Something tells me there’ll be other priorities.”

“Mullins, can we climb it?” Foster asked, keeping his eyes on the screens around his seat. He didn’t really care for this conversation

“Would rather not risk it.”

“Pity, take us around then.” Mullins quickly turned the tank around, driving parallel around the ruined tower. It had shattered, likely hit by stray artillery rounds, the rubble blocking up much of a nearby car park.

“Has he shown up yet?” Weber asked, referring to the Hekatian tank they were searching for.

“CRABs can’t find him.”

“Drone?”

“Still charging.”

“Thought the whole point of the CRABs were they’d do this shit for us.”

“Whole city to clear, and only so many things to do it with.”

“Is it really the army, if they’re not giving us the wrong job? Next I know, they’ll-” Weber was cut off, by Mullins shouting something.

“Tank left!” A laser flashed a few feet in front of the tank, Mullins doing his best to reverse into safety. Adrenaline flooded Foster’s body, as he activated the tank’s smoke launchers, spraying smoke all over the ground. The turret quickly began rotating to hit back, firing a single hurried round off before they were back behind the safety of the ruins.

“Fuck.”

“Everyone good?” Foster asked, trying to calm his body down. *That was sloppy*, he thought to himself. *Could have easily gotten killed there.”

“Y-yeah, yeah. Oh god.” Foster could bear Weber’s deep breaths over the intercom, woven tightly in with his words.

“Life flashed before my eyes there.” Mullins replied.

“We loaded again?”

“Sabot. At this range anything’d do though.”

“Ok. Mullins, gun us around that corner.”

“Wait, what?”

“We’re going after him.”

“I would rather not, considering how close I was to getting vapourised there.”

“Too bad. Someone’s got to kill him.”

“Can-”

“Rank, Mullins.” Mullins sighed, reversing further back, so they would be able to turn the corner at greater speed.

“Ready.” Mullins reported.

“Go.” The tank surged forwards, Mullins giving as much speed as possible. He gave the rubble a wider berth, as Weber kept the gun pointing left, ready to fire as soon as he found the target. Foster watched his screens carefully, expecting at any moment to see the outline of a tank waiting to fire. Instead, the tank, occupants and all, successfully traversed the ground, finding the Hekatian tank to have abandoned its position.

“Well, that was anticlimactic.” Weber commented, turning the gun back to face the tank’s front.

“Don’t you dare. Follow the road, they’re on wheels, so chances are they went that way.”

“Pursuit?”

“Of course.” Mullins didn’t even bother to complain, instead just bringing the tank onto the road. 

Foster spotted a section’s worth of soldiers moving along the road, heading the same direction as they were. Most carried only rifles and machine guns, but one was cradling an AT-4. Perhaps they could be of use. 

“Pull us up along these soldiers.” Mullins complied, halting the tank. Foster opened the hatch, poking his head out. “Hey! You guys see the tank that was there a few minutes ago?”

“We’re hunting it, man! Wanted to blow it up, but it would have mowed us down if we tried to get up and fire on it.”

“Damn. We’re after it too. Might be worth you guys riding with us.”

“Alright.” The soldiers clambered on, the man with the AT-4 sitting himself next to the main gun. Mullins set off once more, slower this time so as not to throw anyone off the tank.

“Bit of advice, if you stay there the autocannon will take your head off.”

“Autocannon? This thing has an autocannon? Why?”

“Long story.” The soldier shrugged his shoulders, then switched to the other side.

“By the way, it’s shields are broke. Got close enough to throw a rock at it a while ago, and it just smacked against the armour. Crew panicked and drove off before Jackson here could get over to fire at it.” The section commander added, sat up on the turret roof next to Foster’s head.

“That’s encouraging then.” The tank rumbled up the road, passing several fast food restaurants. Foster’s stomach rumbled, at the thought of getting something that wasn’t just MREs again. *Some day, some day*.

Mullins slowed the tank down, probably reasoning that it was less safe here. Weber rotated the turret left, then right, looking for the Hekatian tank. Then, once more, a laser flashed past the tank, this time scorching a billboard that had frankly seen enough damage already. Mullins didn’t hesitate, reversing the tank *immediately* into cover, before Weber could even finish rotating the turret.

“Hey, I could have got him there!”

“Fuck that, not risking it.” Jackson got down from the tank, running around to the corner. He fired the AT-4 off, presumably striking the Hekatian tank’s frontal plate. Foster launched the drone off, coming to the conclusion that at this point, it was worth it, even if it only had a few minutes of charge. The drone flew right off the catapult, beginning a circling pattern above the road.

“Mullins, let’s go for a flank.”

“You sure this isn’t some Moby Dick shit?” Mullins turned the tank around once more, advancing up the building’s drive-through, albeit the wrong way. A small railing was utterly crushed in the process. “Chasing something we shouldn’t?”

“Positive.” Foster watched the tank from his drone vantage point, it’s crew reversing as they fired plasma towards where Jackson had just been. “Weber?”

“Got him.” The turret rotated to face the restaurant, gun and all barely fitting in such a confined space.

“Halt!” Foster ordered, Mullins following up. Then Weber fired, a depleted uranium dart bursting through the walls of the restaurant, carrying on, and then striking the Hekatian tank as it attempted to flee. Foster surveilled it for a while, watching as the crew jumped out and fled. The tank did not explode, but it was clearly no longer combat effective. “Perfect. See, wasn’t that hard!”

Mullins grunted, not willing to press the issue.

*Parkton, Maryland*

“How much further do we have to go?”

“Not far, trench system is up ahead!” Sergeant Yates replied, causing 1 Section to ready their weapons, pulling on bolts and loading grenades.

“So we wait for the Russians to blow them to bits, then we mop up the rest?” 

“Pretty much!” Corporal Heppell answered Cooper’s question.

“Perfect, the less effort the better.” 

“Everyone out!” Tergelyx flipped the lever in response to Yates’ shout, the door immediately opening and allowing him to practically *throw* himself out onto the muddy ground behind him. The Warrior had halted along the top of a small hill, firing it’s main gun. Tergelyx sprinted for the ground next to it, lying down so he was protected from Hekatian fire. Ivegbuna got down right next to him, setting her rifle on a toppled tree, while the rest of 1 Section ran on past.

A few hundred metres in front of Tergelyx was an *extensive* trench system, long thin lines covered by sandbags, connected to reserve trenches a few hundred metres back. Hekatian tanks sat in small dugout positions, ready to try and wreak havoc upon any Human assault. A pair of Human jets shot past over Tergelyx’s head, dropping bombs onto the Hekatian positions before turning away. Anti-air plasma rose up to target them, but the pilot’s skill, and the plane’s speed, enabled them to successfully evade every lance.

“How do we know there aren’t any land mines in the way?” Ivegbuna asked, as a flurry of shells started hitting the trenches up ahead, further pounding them into dust. Another Warrior, that of 2 Section, pulled up, and began unloading.

“We don’t! If we could clear it, we wouldn’t be shooting at the Hekatians!”

“This sounds very unsafe.”

“Believe me, we’ve done much less safe things than this.” Tergelyx replied. Glancing over at Corporal Heppell, he could see the Corporal pulling out a pair of binoculars, and fiddling with his tacpad, presumably ready to give extra guidance to the artillery raining down.

“Great, just great. Now I see where that prestige talk came from.”

“No glory without incredible risk of death!” Cooper yelled, the barrage further intensifying. Tergelyx could hear distant rumblings, barely audible against the closer explosions, but signs that the Hekatian lines were being battered for miles each way.

“What’s our plan, Corporal?” Camp shouted, right as several rockets screamed in overhead. A wave of explosions, one after the other, began swallowing up much of the trench complex. Tergelyx didn’t know the *name* of the rockets being used, but he could recognise thermobaric weapons *anywhere*. “Fucking hell.”

“Russians don’t fuck around with their artillery, do they?”

“Nope!”

“Will anything be alive after that?”

“Yes, but they’ll wish they aren’t.” Hekatian artillery began firing back, mostly hitting in no man’s land. *They certainly know we’re coming*.

“For your information, Camp, we’re going for a standard charge! We will take the sections *not* hit by the thermobarics, and clear a path through their lines. Artillery barrage will continue until about the time we close to 100 metres!” Corporal Heppell finally took his eyes off his tacpad.

“Bloody hell.”

“From mud, through blood, and to the green fields beyond, eh?” Forrester replied, a smirk visible. Several Apache gunships took up position in the air above Tergelyx, pummelling the sections of trench least affected by the Russian barrage. Hundreds of spent casings blanketed the ground around 1 Section, a veritable rain of brass.

“That’s tanks, not infantry, you idiot.” Camp answered back

“Why just a charge?”

“Where do you flank, when the whole goddamn line is under attack?” ” A Leopard 2 tank pulled up nearby, firing it’s main gun over the top of the hill, then reversing to reload. Tergelyx saw it’s round strike one of the tanks, cutting straight through. Clearly, the crew had opted to leave it, rendering its shields useless.

“We’re seriously going into the trenches?”

“Course we are, Forrester, how the fuck else you think we clear them? Wait for the fairy godmother to get here?” Sergeant Fletcher paused after that, listening to her radio. “Ivegbuna, about the mines, don’t worry. Some American resistance types already checked it.”

“How did it go for them?”

“Made it 100 metres from where we are before being mowed down. Didn’t step on any mines though.”

“Wonderful.”

“Okay, brace yourselves. We go in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, NOW!”

Tergelyx got up, running forwards at what was a fast pace to him, but to the Humans was more of a quick jog. The rest of the platoon stormed over the hill, their Warriors driving alongside them to provide close-in fire support. As they moved closer and closer, every shell blast felt more intense, the ground shaking, the plumes of dirt thrown up looking larger and larger. 

Slightly further down the line, Tergelyx could see the other platoons, and then whole other companies, one great tidal wave of Humans and Hekatian defectors, crashing against the enemy.

One particularly large plasma artillery round hit just a few dozen metres away, soil slicing through the air as it was ejected at high speeds from the crater. The Human barrage got even stronger, the gunners exerting maximum effort before they would be forced to stop. The mortars had no such requirement, however, and they carried on as ever, their crews keeping a steady stream of high explosive rounds going up into the air.

Tergelyx jumped over a small crater in the ground, clearing it and hitting the ground beyond it running. Several mortars began dumping smoke rounds just in front of the trenches, creating a cloud that would blind the Hekatians as the Humans assaulted. *We can’t be more than 200 metres now*, Tergelyx thought to himself. The heavier guns fired their last salvo, no more sounds of *incoming* streaking through the air. The mortars, meanwhile, switched further back into the Hekatian lines, hammering new targets.

Once more, Tergelyx felt every muscle in his leg straining. He was already slipping, of course, behind the rest of 1 Section, but he did his best. Ivegbuna sped past Tergelyx, a few lances passing over his shoulder as he did so, as Hekatians quickly began leaving their shelters replacing their annihilated comrades. Someone from 2 Section yelped in pain, but Tergelyx didn’t look back, he didn’t have time for that right now.

“Leave him!”

*20 metres.* A Hekatian section, in a small dugout that jutted out from the main line, turned their guns towards the platoon bearing down upon them. Before they could get a single shot off, a well placed 120mm round annihilated them, leaving no survivors. *10 metres.* Ivegbuna and Curtis leapt into the trench, turning each way to rake it with fire. Then Cooper dropped in, quickly unslinging her machine gun and firing from the hip. *5 metres*. Tergelyx realised the entire section was crowding into one area, and so he pressed on a little more, heading for a small turn that linked to the reserve trench. He jumped, noticing only in his descent that he was coming down on top of a Hekatian. 

His boots caught the soldier in the chest, quickly knocking them off balance. Tergelyx brought his rifle to bear, firing a lance as he fell that cut straight through his enemy’s helmet, killing them instantly. Then, finally, the Hekatian’s corpse, and therefore Tergelyx’s boots, made contact with the floor of the trench, and Tergelyx stumbled, having to catch his arm on the wall to stop himself from totally falling over. 1 Section’s Warrior ground past him, it’s turret swivelling around and dispensing 40mm rounds, mixed with 7.62 machine gun fire, at anyone who dared resist.

Bodies littered the trench floor, many of them burnt, blasted and broken by the artillery that had been raining down only a few moments ago. Tergelyx got up, looking around and seeing surprise on Ivegbuna’s face. 

“You do that all the time?”

“No.”

“Ah well, should have said you did. Was cool.” Ivegbuna turned around, pointing her rifle down the the trench, and firing a grenade off. “Did these people never hear of zig-zag trenches?”

“I don’t think they cared, frankly!” Curtis headed past, firing as he ran. Tergelyx remembered his orders, clear the first line. He followed Curtis, Ivegbuna joining up with him after a moment, with 1 Section quickly forming a line behind the pair. Then they began their advance, the rest of the section scanning the ground above.

“Yates, can you grab 2 Section’s casualty? He’s out in the field, looks alive but I don’t dare run out.” Corporal Heppell was probably taking this chance to check up on the situation behind them.

“Yeah we see him Corporal, reversing to grab him now.” An Apache nosed closer, gun and rockets working in tandem to suppress targets deeper into the fortifications. 

“Dugout to our left.” Tergelyx noted, pressing on towards it. Artillery fire began once more, hitting Hekatians in their reserve trenches.

“Grenade out!” Ivegbuna posted a grenade through the small space between Tergelyx and Raxic, aiming it so it bounced into the dugout before detonating. There was a loud *boom*, and a moment later, the dugout roof fell in, smothering any inhabitants, if they had *somehow* survived everything up until now. A Jackal armoured vehicle drove over the trench, just in front of Tergelyx, the secondary machine gunner firing 7.62 rounds towards Hekatian positions. Several plasma lances smacked against it’s thin armour, causing the main gunner to fire off some grenades from his launcher, the plasma fire ceasing quickly.

A Hekatian appeared around the corner of the trench, quickly falling victim to Tergelyx and Ivegbuna guns. Then the tip of a Human rifle, and Tergelyx stuck his hand in the air, signalling a halt. Someone from 2 Section, Private Hall, who Tergelyx had to avoid confusing with 2 Section’s Private *Hull*, became visible. They paused for a second, then recognised Tergelyx, and similarly gestured to their team.

“Ok, Hekatians are on the run! Now, up the reserve trench, deal with any bastards who haven’t run yet!” Corporal Heppell ordered, and Tergelyx turned around, heading for that very connective trench he’d landed in to begin with.

“Heads up, we got 2 Section’s casualty. Bit ‘a bleeding but he’s alright.”

“Good, good.” Tergelyx reached the communications trench he’d originally landed in, returning to the same arrangement with Ivegbuna. Several more Warriors pulled up in the space between trenches, another platoon of infantry jumping out and advancing upon a Hekatian pillbox. Tergelyx reached an entrance to a dugout, pausing before it.

“Dugout!” Tergelyx announced. He looked around the entrance, spotting a Hekatian soldier lying in wait. Tergelyx quickly pulled his head back, before several plasma lance scorched the trench wall beside him. “Grenade needed.”

“Ready.” Ivegbuna once more pulled the pin on a grenade, then tossed it over Tergelyx’s shoulder, landing it precisely inside the dugout. Tergelyx retreated a few steps, then waited, a single Hekatian escaping the bunker, only to be cut down by Ivegbuna. Then there was a loud explosion, and the dugout was destroyed

“Clear.” Tergelyx reported, before continuing forwards. He made it all the way to the reserve trench, halting once more. Ivegbuna tossed a grenade to his left, then Curtis a grenade to the right, shrapnel from both rocketing down the trench line. Tergelyx then charged around the corner, finding several bodies ripped apart by the shrapnel. A Hekatian leaned out from inside a dugout, but Tergelyx was faster, firing a lance straight through their skull. He checked down the trench, finding no more visible opposition.

Quickly, he looked around. Ivegbuna had cleared the right flank while he was busy, watching for any more movement that way. She glanced backwards, seeing Tergelyx was finished with his work, and moved over to join him, Private Hall taking Ivegbuna’s place.

Yet more jets flew by overhead, as several tank engines rumbled closer and closer. It seemed that the Human forced were more than ready to follow up on the breakthrough made here, something that would likely be repeating all the way up and down the line. Tergelyx caught a brief glimpse of movement, a plasma rifle being tossed out onto the trench floor from a dugout. The hand responsible was visible for a few seconds, and Tergelyx almost fired, before Ivegbuna smacked his shoulder.

“Hold your fire! They might be trying to surrender!” Tergelyx realised his mistake, taking a knee as he watched the entrance. The sound of a Warrior’s engine drawing near filled the air, briefly blocking out the thundering guns. “Corporal, got possible POWs here.”

“Got it. Yates, guns ready, don’t fire.” The Warrior turned its main gun upon the entrance, ready to demolish it if there was the slightest bit of resistance. “Tergelyx?”

“This is Private Tergelyx, with the Human forces! You are outnumbered and outgunned! Exit with your hands in the air, and leave all weaponry inside the bunker! You have *one* galactic standard minute to comply!” Tergekyx shouted in Halxian, the Hekatian standard language. It paid to avoid confusion, and just shout instructions in the home language, rather than one only known through an auto-translator.

There was several seconds of pause, the Hekatians inside clearly weighing up what he meant. It was slightly unfair to use a galactic standard minute, since it *was* shorter than a Human minute, but it wasn’t *too* short. Sure enough, a Hekatian stepped out, then another, and another, all watched by the guns of 1 Section. More continued to flow out, and while Tergelyx couldn’t see their faces, he could tell shame would be plastered over all of them. A Hekatian force getting defeated like this, on the defensive, on a large scale, was rare in the Imperium’s history. Hopefully, it would become a lot more common.

“Delta fireteam, check them over.” Corporal Heppell ordered, Curtis and Forrester heading forward to ensure the prisoners were disarmed. “Good work people, time to let everyone else follow on what we’ve done.”

32,p57v43,HFY,Mon Aug 16 06:14:54 2021,Stereotypical Isekai - 21,"""Mark I just don't understand why that would be upsetting. Those were pretty strong weapons."" Niko had been watching this strange conversation for five minutes now.

Expertly crafted, the weapons given to him by Slave, Goddess of Rebellion were rare and hard to find, even if they used lower level materials. An epic weapon for people in the beginnings of their journeys. 

""Okay it's just, I gave him a katana. There were all those weapons and I gave him a katana."" Mark was pinching the bridge of his nose. 

""Right, but."" Zirrilit swallowed her food. ""Why is specifically giving him a katana bad?""

""Okay, I just thought- He's Asian so I just thought- Is that racist?""

""What is an 'Asian'?"" Niko was eating fries, which they had bought at another restaurant before entering this one to eat steak.

""Well, humans have different ethnicities-""

""Are those like subspecies?"" The orc had a little booklet open and was writing this down. ""Do different subspecies have different abilities? Can one run faster or jump higher or something? I think Niko said that human you were talking to was a bit shorter than you.""

""Okay, don't call them subspecies for one and also, no there isn't any differences.""

The orc stopped writing, ""Then why does one group get characterized for using different weapons? That is why you are upset right? Are they naturally sneakier or have abilities that let them close distances? Or maybe they are learning types so more difficult to use weapons are preferred. Are these 'Asian' people smarter or have history of stealth attacks?""

""No, no that isn't how that works at all, stop- Stop saying that.""

""Okay, so you have a bunch of different types of humans on earth right?"" Zirrilit waited for Mark to nod. ""So how are they different?""

Mark paused for a second. ""Uh, skin color mostly, sometimes they have different cultures or are based around different religions I think?""

""Okay so then why do they have different skin color? Is that like an elemental resistance thing? I think I saw some dragonoids with blue skin who resisted cold instead of heat."" Zirrilit made eye contact with the clearly inferior blue dragon kin three tables down.

""No, or actually darker skins can help resist being sunburned better, I'm tan but a little on the pale side so I can get sunburned if I stay outside too long.""

""How long is that?"" Yygah had her notebook out again. ""We were out exercising for about four hours earlier and it was sunny. Or uh, doing training exercises, you couldn't keep going past the first half hour with our regiment.""

""Four hours? I should have burned, did one of you put some sunblock on? Some kind of ability?"" Mark started checking for signs of red skin but found none.

""Mark are you weak to sunlight? Actually..."" Yygah put her hand on her chin, ""They said your angels are bright right? And your god is fairly violent. Could it be that your sun puts out some deadly form of energy?""

""Oh, like UV rays?"" Mark took a bite out of his steak, before he realized the table was staring at him, waiting for an explanation. Mark swallowed, ""Okay so like, the sun puts out UV rays, and the skin cells that get effected kill themselves to stop themselves from becoming cancerous, but it doesn't always work and sometimes you get skin cancer anyway from it. It's not actually a burn, its like... Self inflicted necrosis.""

""What is cancer?"" The orc leaned forward. ""Is that like, a curse or something? I've studied some medicine and I don't think I've heard of that.""

""It's-""

Niko interrupted Mark, ""Wait, can we get back on topic? Earth had multiple races who follow different gods and they hate each other?""

""No- Wait kind of. That's not really how it works.""

Yygah raised a hand, ""You said darker skinned humans had, er... Lesser UV ray resistance. Does your species also have an ability?""

""We aren't different species. Stop saying that it's rude.""

Zirrilit looked up, ""Why is it rude? Are they inferior?""

""No. They aren't. Everyone is just as good as everyone else.""

""My species has lots of inferior subspecies."" Zirrilit was making eye contact with the drakonoid three table down again.

""Stop being racist. I'm going to start getting mad when you talk about other dragonoids if you keep saying it like that.""

Niko finished her fry. ""So, uh, you said something about different religions. Is it bad to hate those too? One enslaved me one time and you helped kill it or something. Can I hate that one?""

""No- Wait yes. That one was evil though.""

""So are any of yours evil?"" Niko was getting to the last of her fries.

""I don't think so, god never really talks to people so sometimes there are faker cults. I think there is a church of satanism, the uh, leader of those demons but those guys are actually pretty nice.

""Demons seem nice too."" Niko started to get to work on her steak.

Zirrilit spoke up, ""Guys, your food is getting cold. Why are you even talking right now?""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Hyo sat in his room, staring at his katana. 

It was long, the blade was about three feet long. Most katanas were only two. It had no decorations, it even looked slightly worn, but there were no marks on the blade.

The angel, as well as the man with brown hair, light skin who was relatively unshaven had given it to him. Along with a power that could be used to save humanity. 

The world was in peril, there had been monster attacks everywhere! Or rather, there had been hundreds of attacks, all at high profile areas. Thousands had died! If there hadn't luckily been forces capable of fighting those monsters nearby entire cities could have been wiped out! 

He heard there were also new religions popping up, America was a big location for monster cults after that guy who had been up charging insulin had his internal organs ripped out of his asshole on live television. 

Truly tragic, or at least could you imagine if it happened to anyone else? Those flying rat things were hardly more dangerous than a pissed off hawk but they showed up in swarms and didn't shy from ripping into whatever they grabbed onto first.

So far all of the magic things that were attacking could be solved with most weapons earth had. Wyverns died to missiles and swarms of those rat things could be shot to death, honestly earth's forces tended to be stronger. An earth vehicle could launch a dozen missiles before they could close distance enough to use a breath attack most of the time. 

But the thing was, wyverns required missiles or those specially designed soldiers that had been patrolling recently. There had been hundreds of monsters to process and make weapons from, not enough to equip enough people to ensure they could not attack anywhere.

And Hyo had been given the power to stop it. He could see his own level, right there floating above his head.

\[Level 2 - 385/900\]. He had leveled after a couple of those rat things had heard him in the boiler room. He managed to kill them both and gained XP, which had given him two more stat points. He was strong enough to crush them with a punch now, instead of knocking them down to be stomped on. It had allowed him to survive being noticed by the swarm long enough to be rescued.

He checked his katana. He had actually been trained for fighting with swords since he was young.

He had trained all his life to use rapiers, which were undoubtedly superior. Did the angels see time differently? Had they given him a katana because they couldn't tell the difference between modern day and the Edo Period? 

Hyo was also Korean, he was in Korea. So really he didn't understand why he had been given a katana. If he had to pick a melee weapon to kill something big with he would have picked a spear.

He couldn't deny its usefulness though, if he stood it upright and let it fall forward it could cut through a brick with one drop. 

It made it all the easier, one of the flying rats had hurt a tendon in one hand so he needed to wield it with his other, more difficult because its handle was made for two. Luckily his training for rapiers meant he already had training for wielding a long blade one handed.

There were monsters outside. He needed to find them, level up, and somehow stop the *boss monster* from showing up. Something that was evidentially capable of eating worlds. 

There was no time for personal emotion or concern over his own well being. He had also been told that the government may try to kidnap him, to discover his abilities, and that they had been gifted from a god. 

It was unlikely that human hands could reproduce these effects, and they might not believe him if he told them what he needed to train for.

He couldn't afford actual protections, like body armor or guns. They had been sold out for weeks now. 

But he could afford a thick duster. Black so as to not stand out at night like the rest of his clothes. Boots to hopefully keep his feet safe when he needed to stomp on those rat things. 

The first day he had tried to wear a mask, and failed. Running in circles while breathing through a cloth was not comfortable, so now he had one that covered the top half of his face. Leaving his nose and mouth uncovered. 

Not a ski mask, his apparel was already hot even at night. A plastic opera mask from a costume store with the bottom half cut off. 

He went out his window, through the bushes and snuck through a few people's backyards. He didn't want people to discover where he lived. 

His first problem happened in an alley way, across the street from a burger shop. 

A winged rat appeared in front of him, it stopped confused for a moment and almost hit the ground. He went to slice it in half but only caught one of it's wings. 

It dropped, hissed and charged at him before he stomped it to death. 

At that moment, three more appeared. All in front of him, crawling out of those black holes. 

He did not miss the closest one, going in for a thrust and tearing it open. He swept his arm to the side and knocked back the one on his left, while chopping at the one on his right. They were both disoriented from their sudden appearances and he succeeded in injuring the wing of the one he chopped at. 

Then he retreated, these monsters were not good at tactics. 

The one with functional wings followed him at a much faster rate, Hyo turned around to skewer that one too just for it to fly around his katana. He lashed out with his other hand again, unable to make a proper fist and knocked it back before it could reach his face. 

He was strong, much stronger than most humans. Even a wild slash with his injured hand was enough to send it sprawling into the wall. He raised his boot and stomped on the one that was running instead of flying, breaking its spine. 

The final one did not stop to run, or to see that Hyo was uninjured despite killing its two companions. 

It charged, despite the difference in range and size, uncaring for it's own body that was now too broken to fly. Hyo killed it easily, and then sat down panting. 

Whatever was sending these monsters, the boss monster. It seemed to be targeting him. Maybe it was a passive ability or some kind of curse, but whenever he was armed and traveled through places out of public sight they appeared. 

He looked towards the entrance to the alley. People were starting to walk in front of it again. Whatever had sent those monsters had either chosen a time where there were no witnesses or had stopped people from approaching until he was finished.

He now saw it above his head. \[Level 2 - 490/900\]

Thirty five experience each, his goal was level three by tomorrow. Physique made him stronger, faster, capable of running further but those things kept dodging. Slashing at moving, flying targets was difficult, he needed more Coordination. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

""I just still don't understand. I hate lots of species, like those other stupid dragonoids who think they are the superior form. On the basis that my form is superior. Also dryads. I had to get this flower from one this one time for a calmness training exercise.""

Zirrilit was still making eye contact with the dragonoid across the room. 

That dragonoid was talking on his phone, Niko had said it wasn't even on. ""I know right, maybe they are just red to cover up how much blood they always end up losing whenever they try and pick on *real* dragons. And lasers? What you mean you can't even kill a whole room full of people if you wanted?""

He was also being incredibly loud, the talk was making all of the bystanders incredibly nervous. 

""Hey Mark, could you even imagine not being strong enough to just kill all the people near you? Like you needed some kind of area of effect spell just to handle people of this level?""

Mark didn't know what she meant by people of this level, there was a really big minotaur staring at both of the dragonoids now. 

""Okay, look we promised that we wouldn't do anything big just this one day okay? So maybe we should both just calm down and we can just finish our steaks.""

Zirrilit stuck her tongue out at the other dragonoid. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Hyo looked up. This thing wasn't a flying rat it was like a wolf, a worg. 

It said it right there, a little text box like the one above his head. He only saw those on himself and monsters. 

\[Lesser Worg\]

No level, monsters didn't get that like he did. But there was no skull and crossbones like the wyverns or chimeras he saw on television.

It growled, circling him. None of the other monsters had done that yet, they just charged as soon as they saw him.

He circled the worg back, but the wolf had simply continued circling him, when he lunged forward the creature jumped back out of range.

It was faster than him, and when he backed up it followed. 

The other monsters were beyond dumb, they shouldn't have been able to survive in any environment but was this intelligence? Could it be negotiated with? 

Or was it simply instinct?

He lowered his blade to his side. The worg leapt the moment the blade was no longer pointed at it and he cut upwards catching the creature in the side. 

Two halves fell onto the ground behind him.

He was splattered with blood and gagged, falling onto his ass.

\[Level up!\] *You have gained  2  stat points!*

He put them into coordination. Whatever was summoning creatures to him was summoning stronger ones. But he could deal with that later, right now he was going to shower.

Mark was pulling Zirrilit by one of her teeth. They weren't in danger of falling out but more importantly if she didn't follow his hand movements she ran the risk of slicing his hand open.

""I-h haid hi horry."" She wanted to grab his hand and pull him out of her mouth, but putting too much force on him was more liable to hurt him than make him let go. Plus she saw the way Mark was smiling towards the two across from them, it gave her a slight chill.

""I am sorry ma'am, I think we might have caused you issues. I hope you can forgive us.""

A girl with dark skin, almost black, white hair and pointed ears smiled back at his group. 

""It's no problem, I find that *dragons* tend to get a little rough if you let them.""

Her boyfriend, the blue dragon kin was floating upside down, too far from any surface to push off of. Dangling helplessly. 

They could have theoretically overpowered these methods. The floating dragonoid could have launched a breath attack to propel himself or slammed his body weight around fast enough to outmaneuver the enchantment, Zirrilit could have easily ripped her own tooth out of Mark's grasp. Even if he was strong enough she couldn't make him let go she could regrow her teeth if needed.

But both of the dragonoids saw that *smile* that held no joy, the way a parent looked at a child who had done something unforgivable in public. 

The dragonoids showed the fear of a child who was about to go home with said parents, and no longer be under the protection of a public eye. 

""Ish haid I'hmm horry.""

""We can pay for the chair, and uh the chandelier that broke."" Mark held up his card. 

""No, no I believe it was our fault the chandelier was destroyed. It's still covered in ice."" The girl held up her own card.

Technically it wasn't nothing like the guards asked, but all they had to do that day was file a report on property damage.

“Hey, Dave!” Sil waved at Dave as he came home with Xiash.

“Hi,” Dave waved back, still thinking about his appointment with the doctor. “What are you doing here?”

Sil played with her fingers and glanced at the door to Dave’s room. “You remember your promise?”

Dave blanked out for a moment, thinking about what Sil meant.

“You know, that bet between me and Xiash at the sports game…”

“Ah! Right, of course. How could I have forgotten.”

Xiash stared at Sil and frowned. “You only won because Xoe lost the first round. It shouldn’t count.”

“But the bet wasn’t about whether or not Xoe would win, but what *team* would win,” Sil grinned.

Xiash grunted. “Okay, have fun, I’ll be back tomorrow or whatever…”

As Xiash turned and walked away, Dave went to the door and opened it, letting Sil go first before him.

“So, what do you want to do first?” Sil beamed at Dave, then frowned at his thoughtful expression. “Is something wrong?”

“Huh?” Dave snapped to attention, then shook his head. “Ah, I don’t know, just finding out that I’m potentially the dad to many kids is kind of daunting, I think.”

“Many kids?” Sil tilted her head to the side and crossed her arms over her ample chest. “What do you mean?”

Dave strode over to the couch and slouched down into it. “Well, apparently I have super cum…” he laughs, the idea sounding absurd. “Can easily knock up a girl with little to no effort.”

Sil blinked at that. “So, are you saying all those times you came in a girl…means that they are almost definitely pregnant?”

“Yes. If they have the eggs or whatever. I don’t know, I’m not a girl.”

“You mean ovulating?”

“I don’t know, I guess I do.”

“So then, it's likely that only half of them are actually pregnant.”

“How so?”

“Well, there is such a thing as ‘safe days’; days where it's okay to cum in a girl and not result in anything.”

“So, was that why Xiash wasn’t pregnant?”

“Probably, yeah.”

Dave had no real clue about sex, other than it felt good and that babies could be born from it—he skipped a lot of the sex-ed stuff in school, it was pretty boring. He then noticed a strange look on Sil’s face. “Is something wrong?”

“Well, having this conversation has me thinking about Meila again—and my sisters,” the naga sighed, leaning on one hand.

Dave nodded, recalling the story about her brother and father.

“But you know, the more I think about it, the more I want a kid of my own,” Sil smiled. “Meila seemed to do my sister a lot of good, maybe it’ll do me a lot of good too…”

Dave raised an eyebrow at that. “Are you saying what I think you’re saying?”

Sil gave Dave a sly grin. “Oh, I think you know what I mean. But first, I think we should have something to eat before we start!”

“And what do you suggest?”

“Well, I think we should get some rangishi—a traditional Dylak dish.”

\#

Dave thought it strange that Sil was cooking in the small kitchen of his room. He never really seen that much cooking, aside from the kebab van, shaving off the lamb. His sisters—not Georgina—were usually the ones to cook, as they had much more free time to do so than him, Georgina or his mum. He’d been over a friend’s house many times and heard of food being made, but he was always either out in back in the small garden, kicking a football around or upstairs in his room with all his brothers, playing games.

“I’m not much of a cook, Dave!” Sil called out from the kitchen. “And, well, this is probably the easiest dish I can make—especially considering that it keeps in the fridge pretty well.”

Dave had heard that some of his friends that went to university, had made lots of foods that could be cooked and recooked, over and over, because it was much cheaper than the alternative.

“But I promise you, that even though it’s easy to make, does not mean it’s not good.”

Dave was leaning over and stared at Sil’s back. “That’s some nice clothes to have on,” he gave the compliment easily, staring at the backless dress, that cut off a little below her crotch. He liked how it made her hips curve and taper into her tail; her waist was narrow, almost hourglass; the skin on her back appeared smooth and silky.

“Just crack an egg in there to complete my mum’s secret recipe, and…it’s done!” Sil cheered, stirring a ladle in the large pot. She turned around and beamed at Dave. “I hope you’re hungry because I sure am.”

A few moments later, Sil slithered up to the table where Dave sat and set down a plate in front of him.

Dave stared at it for a moment and looked up right to Sil, who was sitting into her coils, ready to tuck in. “This looks just like vindaloo curry!”

“Curry? Is that a human dish?” Sil raised a pair of eyebrows, using her spoon to scoop up the rice-like grain and the curry.

“Yeah, it is. But,” Dave hesitated, recalling the throat burning of the last time he had vindaloo. “Is it spicy?”

“I don’t know, yes?”

Dave stared at Sil for a time, hoping to find some sort of reaction. But after a few spoonfuls of nothing happening, he sighed and took the bite.

He was pleasantly surprised, as it wasn’t spicy at all but was somehow more barbeque-like. It had the hickory smoke flavour sweetness of American barbequed chicken, while still having the hearty warmth of a beef stew. The rice, was more like bread, soft and fluffy in his mouth, like getting a fresh loaf of bread from the bakery. The vegetables reminded him of potatoes, carrots and onions—neither cooked to mush or still raw.

“You like it?” Sil asked, her expression unreadable.

Dave nodded eagerly. “I love it!”

\#

After having scarfed down all the food on their plates, Sil and Dave wandered over to the bed.

“Do you like the dress, Dave?” Sil asked, a smirk playing at her lips. “I had it imported from Earth—Georgina had me curious with her strange fashion sense.”

“Well, I love it!” Dave beamed, taking the snake-woman by the hips and pulling her down to the bed. “But then, I think you look beautiful, no matter what you wear.”

Sil blushed and wiggled about in his grip. “That’s so nice of you to say…”

Dave’s hands roamed Sil’s body, only to stop at the hem of her dress. “I going to get a nice big house, Sil, where all of us—Xiash, Filo and all the rest—can live. But do you want to, Sil, live in that house?”

Sil blinked and smiled. “Of course, I do, silly! That would be the nicest things to happen to a girl like me…that and having a kid of my own.”

Dave smiled and kissed Sil on the lips.\\

61,p6f2b8,HFY,Wed Aug 18 02:18:47 2021,"Humanity's future is one giant leap away. What's 950 light-years between friends? The Andromeda Paradox, Part 1","“Humanity's Future Is One Giant Leap Away!”

Samson Kent couldn't stand buzzwords designed to simplify what had been a colossally herculean effort by the whole of planet Earth to find a home worthy of a jump across the galaxy. Mankind’s Terran home had become an inhospitable place, and Mars had rejected Earth's feeding hand. People certainly weren't too keen on traversing the vastness of space to find a new home. How ironic that humanity's future sat orbiting an entirely average star 950 light-years away.

It might as well have been right next-door. 

Sam sat on the observation deck of the USCV Andromeda. He had a drink in his right hand whose brown liquid jumped and quivered as his hand shook. He managed to bring the glass to his lips and sipped the warm whisky. He wished for some liquid courage.

He found none. 

Everyone else around him on the titanic vessel was celebrating and cavorting as though it were the end of the world. The Andromeda was to be humanity's salvation. Unmanned trips had gone effortlessly. Successful flights brought the ship to Kepler 20 and back a dozen times. Canaan Prime, as the planet had been named, was beyond paradise. Life, only mildly hostile at times, thrived on this planet that was slightly larger than humankind's terrestrial origin.

“I'm going to have an orgy on our balcony!” one drunkard screamed to the delight of the crowd.

A leggy blonde sat across from Sam and shook her head in disapproval. She typed away on her tablet and brushed her curled locks away from her eyes as she continued to work on whatever she was writing. Bluish eye shadow was applied modestly to her delicate face. Her pale cheeks had well-defined bone structure just under her paper-like skin. Despite her frail appearance, something about the woman exuded an aura of uncommon strength.

“Feeling almost as optimistic as I am, then?” Sam tried to break through the iceberg that seemed to be cast in permanence around her visage.

The woman momentarily glanced up from her writing. Her green eyes were illuminated by the tablet’s whitish glow. Black glossy buttons stood out against her cream-colored blouse whose neckline plunged down to reveal an equally pale chest. 

“Hmm,” she replied nonchalantly.

Almost as quickly as her gaze had sprung up, it dipped back down. Clearly conversation was not a priority for this woman. Sam didn’t blame her. He got nervous on flights between planets. Now this gargantuan ship was going to travel farther than humanity’s radio waves ever had in just the blink of an eye. 

“Less so, it would seem,” a stranger finished, carrying a purple sparkly drink as she sat down on the seat next to the mystery blonde. The smiling girl had a slightly inebriated glimmer in her eyes. Her black hair shimmered as the light flowing from the enormous window at the fore of the room shifted. Her cheeks were flushed warm pink, and her skin glistened as a woman who had already danced, or fucked, her heart out. The clingy, shimmering gold dress lent itself equally to either possibility. “She seems almost as morose as you are.”

The blonde flashed a slight red under her eyes and her lower lip jumped up as her face contorted. All this transpired without her breaking gaze with the mysterious and pivotally important document she seemed to be working on. 

“Violet Fortenbraugh,” the dark-haired woman announced, “I suppose we best be getting to know each other quite well. There are to be 6000 colonists this first time around, not exactly a big city. I guess that’s why everyone is drinking so freely. No one is quite sure how to break the ice. How do you say, ‘Bye mum and dad, I’m off to another corner of the galaxy? Don’t look for me to write or chat.’”

Her Germanic accent only really slipped through on the last few words of her sentence. Sam Kent was eager to learn all about her—after the jump. He’d feel much better after the jump. 

Worse than anything else was the fact that Sam now joined the uninformed masses in calling it a jump. Use of fusion technology to form tears in the fabric of space-time sounded like the machinations of a coked-up science-fiction writer. The ability to travel within these tears was a process years in the making by the department of defense and a heap of money so large, it would have made a certain cartoon duck decry its glittery gold excess. 

The first man to travel across the galaxy in a single moment said it felt like he was staring into the face of God as he emerged from the recently nicknamed ""side-space."" It was startling to think of time and space as being intertwined. The fact that punching in the wrong coordinates could theoretically teleport the ship ten-thousand years into the past was—disquieting. Sam tried to reassure himself that general relativity rendered time travel impossible. 

“It’s more than that, though,” Sam spoke up. “I helped work on the drive, and our perfect strangers, slash best-friends, all around us aren’t a bit concerned with the fact that our test group went from thirty to more than five-thousand. The exponential increase in mass should have been—”

Sam paused. He looked between the two women and saw their bugged eyes. Perhaps it wasn’t the best time to be discussing the distinct possibility that the launch had been rushed. He didn’t like being aboard and he understood the physics behind it. Sam rolled his shoulders and sipped his drink.

“Sorry,” he corrected, “running my goddamn mouth off with a couple of beautiful women sitting around me. If I don’t get my head out of my ass, it’s gonna be a long flight.” 

“Well that’s what’s right brilliant, Mr.—” the blonde finally spoke as she swiped down to power off her device.

“Samson Kent,” he answered quickly. “Sam.” 

“Mr. Kent,” she continued, “if all goes as planned, isn’t likely to be a long flight at all, is it?”

The blonde’s Scottish accent was intoxicating. Her low voice was sensual and sirenic. Its melodic rise and fall brought a warmth to Sam’s face and heart.

“I suppose that’s true no matter what,” he returned without thinking.

“Why’d you say that?” the blonde asked.

“I—uh,” he nervously chuckled, “I need to think before I speak.” 

“Oh no, I don’t think so, mate. Cannae drop shite like that, then walk away ‘thout cleaning it up.” 

“Charming,” Violet muttered in a low grumble.

Sam tried to ignore the subtle looks that jabbed between the two women. He cleared his throat and looked at the floor before returning his gaze to the blonde.

“I mean, travel across light years will be over quickly, whether or not we make it out alive. The ship isn’t really moving, per-se. The star system is coming to us.” 

“Fuck, Sam. Not something you say to a first-time intergalactic traveler!” Violet protested.

“All of us pioneers then, yeah?” the blonde corrected.

“Right, Miss—” Violet huffed before she looked the blonde up and down pointedly. “What was your name, again?”

“Oh right, I never introduced myself,” the blonde muttered. The unknown Scot took a deep breath, flipped her tablet into the expensive-looking lambskin satchel at her feet, and stood up. “And I, don't plan to.”

Something about the blonde's attitude caught Sam's attention as she strode away, clicking her black heels into the cold hard floor. He was hopelessly attracted to either her nonchalant demeanor or her heart-stopping, superb ass. 

“Well I'd like to forget that in short order,” Violet frowned as she rose to her feet and straightened out the creases in her dress. “Care to join me on the viewing bridge?”

Sam smirked. The things he would do for a few minutes alone with that woman.

“Lead the way!” he replied, hopping to his feet. “I mean we’re here anyway, right?”

“Well don't let me twist your arm about it or anything! I have never taken a man against his will, and I hardly have any desire to start now.”

The particular verbiage was not lost on Sam. He wasn't sure how he felt about the short woman walking a few steps in front of him. He got the feeling that he would get to know Violet exactly as much as he desired to, if that was what he wanted. Frankly, how could he not desire the impeccable specimen standing before him?

“It’s more—” Sam felt his throat catch as the words froze in his throat. He looked out across the vastness of space, but unlike most of the terrible blackness that occupied nearly all the universe, this port was quite busy. Ships larger than aircraft carriers buzzed about beneath the even larger colonial ship, Andromeda. He thought it ironic that as an engineer who lived on the bleeding edge of starship technology, he was also deathly afraid of spaceflight. 

“Are you scared, Sam?” Violet chuckled lightly as she approached the nickel-colored handrail that separated the terraced levels of the observation deck. 

*“And now for a special treat, ladies and gentlemen. This is your Captain, Samantha Butler, and we are going to be firing up the plasma shielding for one last test. It should be quite a show. Look out your nearest port or make your way to the observation platforms for the prettiest damn show in the solar system.”*

“Of course, I’m not. I designed the damn—” 

Sam was interrupted in his reply as a throng of people surged forward and pressed into his personal space. He grunted in distress as his body was shoved into Violet, along with a dozen complete strangers.

“Ignition in five...four...three…” a male synthetic voice announced over the intercom.

Sam prepared internally for the deafening oohs and ahhs that would surely follow what he knew looked like a fireworks display. 

“This should be good,” Violet grinned. 

The hull hummed and moments later their view was swallowed in an undulating wave of white that crashed across the window. The pulsating light was blinding as it transformed into a teal hue. The sequins in Violet’s dress reflected the glorious sight, and the sparkles in her raven hair shined back as though she were a movie-star. 

“Plasma burn successful across all frequencies,” the neutral male voice continued. 

Just as quickly as it had arrived, the flow faded. Space looked especially black in contrast to the dazzling light that had filled the cavernous hall just a moment prior. The escort ships accompanying Andromeda were hardly visible to Sam’s still-adjusting eyes. The massive machines of war were put in orbit as a show of force to anyone determined to stop the colonial mission. There were detractors who disagreed with the idea of flinging several-thousand citizens to another arm of the galaxy. Of course, the warships wouldn’t be able to accompany Andromeda across the universe. She was unique in her ability to make jumps with what was still considered to be experimental technology. 

Sam supposed that made the crew of the colonial ship the largest assembly of guinea pigs ever created. He wondered if they chose not to outfit the battleships with the technology because weapons were expensive, and people were cheap. Sam, of course, had no doubt that should the test succeed, the military would highly value being able to blink anywhere in the galaxy instantaneously. 

Theoretically, the travel range could even be extended to anywhere in the known universe. However, as the range increased, the power requirements scaled up, and no one wanted to lose a ship worth trillions of dollars on a hunch. 

Residents were required to board the Andromeda twelve hours prior to departure. Everyone had a room, or bunkhouse, assigned to them. The ordinals, or lower-classed residents, were confined to the rear of the ship adjacent to the aft engineering deck. Classism was timeless, and its wicked grip clenched tight even as the fringes of humanity reached toward the stars. Sam had been on the ship for nine hours. It felt like days. He looked forward to arriving on Canaan. Mountains that stretched higher than Everest were commonplace on the planet. He always preferred desolate mountainous regions to the populous cities of modern America. Finding places without advertisements being crammed into every inch of available airspace grew ever-more challenging on a daily basis. 

As the crowd began to dissipate, Sam took an exaggerated step backward from Violet. Regardless of her thoughts toward him, he still wasn’t entirely sure what to make of the mysterious and flashy woman. 

“I don’t have germs, you know,” Violet grinned as the roar of the crowd fell to a low murmur. 

*Not true. Everyone has germs,* Sam thought. 

“I was just giving you space. I value mine and I figured you might, too. Either way, I probably should get going. Lots to do before liftoff, you know?”

“Shame,” Violet frowned. “There’s so much to see here, and we are going to be cooped up on the colony for quite a long time. Some might never return to Earth. If I’m going to be working to survive on a new planet, I want to enjoy civilization for a few more minutes. Come on, there must be something you wanted to see.”

“Well, actually,” Sam spoke without thinking again. “No, it’d be quite a hike.” 

“Oh, do tell! What splendor has captured the attention of the great Samson Kent?” 

“Well, there’s a press event in thirty minutes in the rear engineering deck. They are going to fire up the main reactor to start filling the mega-capacitors for the singularity. It looks like a sun. I’m sure they are going to flex the output to maximum so that it’s a good show. I’ve never seen one that size before at full capacity.”

“So, you are saying you want to show me your huge, hot, gassy ball?”

“Hah,” Sam let out an increasingly confident chortle. “Maybe. Let's see how the night goes.”

The pair smiled mischievously as they walked back across the observation deck that looked more reminiscent of an airport terminal. Tones of silver and black leather were repeated throughout the modern and immaculate socialization center. The nubile status of the ship showed as guests put the first nicks into virgin upholstery as they sloppily stumbled around in utter ecstasy. 

The observation deck was one of the main centers of the ship that was connected directly to the tram system. At over a half of a mile long, transport proved to be a necessity as essential crew members couldn't be asked to hike ten miles in a workday when they might have to hop between cargo storage, engineering, and the bridge. Running every five minutes in both directions, they made short work of the ships intimidating size. 

They boarded a car with plain cream walls and wide windows that only seemed to provide a view of the dark painted steel behind the train. 

“You'd think they'd give riders something to look at with windows like that,” Violet complained as a mass of people crowded into the overloaded tram.

“Just wait,” Sam answered, “it gets a lot better.”

“Please stand clear of the doors. The shuttle is departing momentarily,” called the same monotonous male voice that announced the shield test minutes before. 

Sam wasn't a fan of shipboard AI that were designed to provide a human experience. He liked his computers dumb and simple. This was exactly the opposite of what he found attractive in women. Although, after the abrupt end of his previous relationship—Violet and the mystery blonde both seemed equally enticing. As they stood waiting for departure, Violet’s pert breasts pushed up tightly against his lower ribs were tipping the scales in her favor. She tilted one half of her smile up in a knowing grin as she looked into his eyes. 

As the small railcar continued to accelerate, it rose slightly and entered a glass tunnel that ran along the ship’s entire length. Even with his fear of heights, the ride was exhilarating for Sam. Maybe it was the fact that the rail seemed lower in relation to the ship and he was eye level with the sloping metal hull, or maybe it was the pleasant company. He couldn’t help looking up at the intimidating full moon that seemed so much closer now than it did on Earth. He knew the ship had been constructed above the Earth’s moon in orbital dry-dock, but he wasn’t the one who’d built it, he just designed one critical part. 

Violet shifted slightly and her chest slid up against his onyx-colored dress shirt. It made the fabric tug ever so slightly against her small shoulders. She seemed to enjoy the closeness. Her eyes nervously edged downward every few seconds as her lips slightly pursed.

“Please hold on to the handrail. Engineering ahead,” the male construct informed. Its words snapped Samson out of his stupor. 

*“Please watch your step while exiting the vehicle.  Next stop, cargo containers A, B, and C.”*

Everyone on the tram apparently had the same idea as Sam. They lurched forward in one huddled unit and joined the waiting gaggle of press at the slick double doors that were still closed leading to the reactors. 

“Ladies and gentlemen!” a bespeckled redhead called. “Please ensure you are wearing your protective eyewear when the reaction begins. The United National Space Partnership will not be held responsible for any damage you may incur to your retinas due to negligence. If you check the release form signed at the beginning of this tour, you'll see we have been released from indemnity for injuries aboard the Andromeda.”

“Do we have glasses?” Violet whispered as she nudged her way through the grumbling crowd.

“I do,” Sam said proudly. “And…”

Sam deftly slipped his hand into a young man's satchel as he passed and delicately yanked the plastic-wrapped safety equipment from his bag. 

“Samson!” Violet whispered in a false teasing voice, “You naughty boy. How will he watch the light show now?”  Sam took note that she accepted the glasses without protest, despite her raised concerns.

“Well, I wasn't always an engineer,” he smiled with a wink. Confidence flowed through him because of the proximity to his home turf. “Besides, there are plenty of spares, so he can ask for another pair. You can't.”

While moving toward the front of the room, Sam noticed a familiar face standing guard by the employee entrance. The man's name tag read Roger Dorne, but his name never seemed to fit the body he'd been born with. The stocky man looked as though he could lift a car, despite being only slightly taller than Violet, who was of entirely average height for a woman. Sam approached the man warmly.

“Roj,” Samson began exaggeratedly, “how ‘bout this crowd?”

Violet was immediately taken aback by the sudden drop in Samson's intonation. She was also struck by the adoption of what seemed to be a New York accent by the man who'd spoken without any dialectal distinction before. 

“Oh, my God!” the hairy Italian man replied, loosening his stone face. “You got no fuckin’ idea what they're putting us through for the launch. Everyone gets carded. No exceptions. Too much for me. Non-stop shifts. You know how it is, Sammy. I'm burning both ends of the goddamn wick here.”

“I hear ya Roj. Hey, listen—you think you can let us in the employee side? You got my word as a gentleman I won't take her past the airlock.”

The two men stared at each other for a moment with incredulity. Roger's eyes looked up and down Violet and whipped between the two of them rapidly. 

“Sammy, I can't just—”

“Remember Rhonda with the ass? I introduced the two of you!”

“Rhonda with the ass,” Violet mouthed to herself. Her eyes rolled so hard she thought her retinas might detach. 

“Ahhh—Sam, why you gotta throw that shit in my face? You know the trouble I could get in for—”

“You won't,” Sam assured.

“Ten fuckin’ minutes. I'm coming to get you in ten fuckin’ minutes. And I ain’t trying to sound like a creep, but I gotta pat down your friend. No fuckin' exceptions.”

“Of course,” Sam agreed without consulting his companion. 

She glared, but the idea of watching apart from the unimaginable number of people crowded aboard the Andromeda did sound appealing. She shrugged and walked forward with arms spread.

“Real respectful, I swear. This isn't just an opportunity to feel up a pretty girl. I'm just doing my job, see?” 

Violet harrumphed as the man approached her with outstretched arms. Sure enough, although it was a thorough pat down, he didn't stray far from any areas that would be on a typical search. He finished quickly and gave her a nod.

“Thanks ma'am,” Roger announced with a firm nod. “Listen, Sammy, ten—”

“Ten fuckin' minutes,” Sam laughed, mocking the man as he tapped his wrist to the door lock. A red light illuminated a pleasant green, and the lock mechanism clicked. Violet entered first and looked around the large windowed room. Sam moved to follow but was grabbed across his shoulder by Roger who leaned in closer. 

“Twenty, and you owe me details after.”

Sam chuckled and reached over his shoulder to pat Roger's meaty hand three times in rapid succession. Without any further words, the pair split, and the door hissed to a tight seal. Sam and Violet were alone. 

“Fuck. Me.” 

Violet’s whisper was reverent as she stared upward at the miniaturized sun hovering amidst the Andromeda’s secondary reactor.

“That's the plan,” Sam mouthed to himself. 

“So, before the show starts, I have a bit of a confession to make,” Sam admitted.

“What’s that?” Violet queried without breaking her gaze with the reactor sitting eighty or so feet in front of her.

“You know I worked on this reactor tech. You also know I helped with its implementation. It stands to reason—I’ve tested this reactor before, the big one that is,” Sam replied, pointing off at the much larger nesting for the ship’s primary reactor. “I’m sorry I wasn’t up front about it in the first place, I just really wanted to spend some time alone with you.”

“Huh,” Violet shrugged, “well—it was hardly necessary.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“Why do you think I sat down at your table, Sam? I thought you were cute. There wasn’t much you could have said wrong.” 

Violet edged closer to Sam and finally tore her gaze away from the beautiful but terribly powerful sight behind her. She took twisting steps and let her hips rock slightly.

“You were tall; taller than me that is. You were dark and from some kind of Spanish country in the Americas, I’m assuming. You’re wearing a nametag, which means you already have a job in this unknown land. You had that—tight curly hair that seemed to be held in place by the hand of God. You had really nice shoulders,” Violet continued, running her hand down his arm.

“Why lie to me and fuck your chances all to hell?”  

*“Violet, listen, I’m—”*

“—Sure you are very sorry, but if I have learned one thing from you in the thirty-minutes we have known each other, it’s that you are a chameleon. You change your colors to match the situation. It’s certainly useful, and frankly I don’t even think I particularly mind, but don’t you dare use that manipulative bullshit with me and then deign to think you’re going to get lucky.”

The woman’s words left a smoking crater in Samson Kent’s ego. He was a social con-artist and was frankly very unused to being called on it. Violet was smart, clearly. She saw through him in moments where others had never caught on to his ruses. He needed to change course and quickly.

“Right, Violet. You’re dead on.”

“I know,” she snapped.

“I am flexible with the exact truth—”

“You’re a liar,” she corrected flatly.

“I’m a liar. I’m a master of bullshit and I know how to get what I want out of people.”

“A manipulative, cunty, scared-of-space, fuck,” Violet grunted.

“I uh—” Sam stumbled, “couldn’t have said it better myself.”

“Ladies and gentlemen, if I could have your attention, please!” the redhead called through a speaker. Her entire crew had filed into the adjacent room while Sam and Violet were discussing his personality.

“Before they start,” Sam paused, moving closer to Violet, “I want to say I know I fucked up and—”

“Hey,” Violet interrupted, as was becoming the norm. She grabbed his face and pulled him in for a brief kiss while the host instructed the other guests on safety protocols and let them know that it was time to don their glasses. 

“I like manipulative, cunty, scared-of-space, fucks.”

*“Violet—”* 

“Shh,” she smiled. “The show is starting.”

Sam approached Violet from behind and placed a hand on her hip. It was a bold move, but one she didn’t stop. She leaned into his chest and looked upward at his face.

“FYI, if you ever lie to me like that again, once, I’m fucking done. I really hate being lied to. I’m not a child, and I’m not to be treated like one. Not that I’m saying this is anything yet—it’s not. Tonight, and whatever happens, is just for fun.”

“Understood.”

*“The Dorman reactor is the most powerful fusion device ever placed on a mobile platform. Outputting almost 90 gigawatts, it is twenty times more powerful than industrial fission nuclear plants used to be in the 21st century.”*

“We aren’t going to screw tonight, Sam,” Violet said without turning from the presenter who now sported fashionable black glasses.

Sam let out an unintentional puff of air. He wasn’t surprised, but maybe a little disappointed.

*“This inconceivable power is what is going to enable us to boldly go—where no man has gone before.”* 

Thunderous applause and hooting reverberated, and even made it through the extremely thick glass that sat before Sam and Violet. It seemed to go on for an eternity.

Sam chuckled in disgust at the presenter’s words. He yelled at a volume that made Violet a bit uncomfortable. 

“That’s pandering and you know it!”

“Hah!” Violet scoffed. “Can she see us? You’re going to distract her.” 

“One-way glass,” Sam smiled. “You can probably tell it’s near-soundproofed too.” 

“In that case—” Violet seemed to warm up. “Shut up and let’s blaze some atoms, you Trekkie cunt!”

*“In one minute, we will all stand in awe of the breathtaking power—of the sun.”* 

“So, they can’t see the one right over there?” Violet pointed leftward and out the glass slightly behind the pair.

“I’m sure they blacked out this whole wall for dramatic effect.” 

*“With a fusion containment unit over 100 feet in diameter, the engineering deck is the largest aboard the Andromeda. The reaction reaches unimaginable temperatures of 620,000,000 degrees kelvin. Even with the heat shielding, you are sure to feel this.”

“So, ninety feet of solid fusion reaction?” Violet mused softly. “How big is the one behind us?” 

“Fifteen feet,” Sam smiled. “This is about to blow your mind.” 

*“Alright, Jason, begin the countdown. Let’s start with one minute until ignition.”*

“Yes ma’am,” Jason, the ship’s AI, returned. “One minute and counting. Insertion of antimatter clamps initiating.”

“Where—,” Violet wondered aloud. “Where did we get something like that? How do we *hold* it?” 

“Sorry, ma’am,” Sam spoke deeply. “That’s heavily classified.”

“Pfft! Typical faux-explanation for *I have no fucking idea*.”

Four gigantic arc-shaped arms descended from the ceiling and rose from the floor in order to make a claw like shape over the still invisible mass. The whole ship began to hum around the room and the crowd looked about in worried glances.

“Check it out,” Violet murmured. “Look at the back of the crowd, there.” 

The unknown blonde woman stood in her same black and white checkered skirt that hugged her form tightly. She was solely focused on the reaction. She didn’t seem worried. In fact, she typed away on her tablet without breaking eye contact with what was happening ahead of her. The tablet seemed to float in front of her. Sam guessed it was a transparent carbon-fiber mounting that was probably strapped to her waist. Now he knew for sure what he had suspected all along. She was a reporter.

“Look!” Sam excitedly pointed toward the middle of the colossal claw. “That’s the helium-3 isotope. That tiny gram of matter is about to light up like the Fourth of July.” 

Violet looked over her shoulder a bit befuddled. She wasn’t American.

“Right,” he shrugged. “It’s like a fireworks display.” 

The claws closed tightly around the almost invisible arm in the center of the reactor as it retracted. Sam was sure it had left the isotope suspended by the antimatter claws. 

“Now ladies and gentlemen, with the magic that is used to hurtle us across the galaxy, we are going to make our own—tiny—star.” 

“Five,” Jason began the countdown. Both Violet and Sam stood on their tiptoes to see clearly over the crowd. Without fully deciding on the action, Violet reached down and squeezed Sam’s hand in excitement. He already knew, she was right to be thrilled. This was his favorite part of the job. It truly never got old.

*“...two, one.”*

The humming that had risen to a crescendo crashed down in what sounded like an awful crackling of electricity. The claws dove inward, driven by incomprehensible force from the secondary reactor. Much like making a diamond, they smashed the pair of isotopes together without allowing the atoms to split apart. Without the claws, they might have accidentally triggered a fission-based explosion, given the size and number of protons and neutrons being sandwiched and compressed.

Violet expected a kaboom. She thought there would be a shockwave. Instead, the claws slowly began to separate. In the center was a microscopic ball of fire. As they spread apart, streams of matter began to flow into the reaction from the top and bottom, providing additional “fuel” to the flames. The electromagnetic shielding forced the tongues of flame inward as the reaction expanded. The guide was right. Violet felt the heat against her skin from the thermal energy of the reaction, and it was only a third of the way open. 

*“Ladies and gentlemen of the press, we have critical mass!”* 

Applause filled the auditorium, and Violet found her hands clapping unintentionally along with them. The sight was breathtaking, and it was only going to get better.

“Jason!” the redhead yelled over the roar of the crowd. “Let’s raise the reaction to ninety percent capacity.” 

“Here we go,” Sam smiled. 

The sun, that first only sat around twenty feet in diameter, was slowly stretched apart by the claws in one smooth motion. What once was a bright white ball whose arcs were almost imperceptible along its surface, grew to an eighty-foot monstrosity that morphed to a yellowish orange. Flares danced in gorgeous arcs across the atmosphere as the reaction stabilized. 

“Holy shit,” Violet whispered almost silently.

The audience gasped and reporters who were once able to type and watch simultaneously, stood dumbstruck in the face of terrifying power. The heat became intense as the power of the reaction increased exponentially. The group was silent. Even Sam stood stoic in the face of all that humanity had accomplished.

“I am become Shiva—” Violet spoke with a hint of melancholy, “—Destroyer of worlds.” 

Oppenheimer’s words struck Sam in his observation. He’d always viewed fusion as the precipice of human achievement—at least until the Andromeda. Humanity’s transition to an intergalactic civilization was almost complete. They were far from alone in the universe, as life was concerned. A few hundred years had so drastically changed life on Earth and perceptions of what was important. They were—and had to be—better in colonization of the stars. Humans held the power of the gods in their hands. Sam viewed humanity’s goal as a noble one. They needed to expand for their own survival’s sake, but at what cost? Even in landing on Canaan, they would likely cause the extinction of various species of plants and animals. The research process in classification of alien lifeforms was sure to start cautiously, but less careful minds would thereafter undoubtedly prevail as promises of profit overcame duties of stewardship. Violet was right. Humanity would rape and destroy Canaan Prime as surely as they had Earth. The thought washed a sadness over Sam’s face. He was a man of science, and hardly cared for the “rat race” of daily life. Unfortunately, those running said gauntlet were the ones signing his paychecks. 

The reaction continued to pull outward until the claws came to rest in their ceiling nesting. Ninety percent capacity meant the reactor was outputting unfathomable amounts of energy into the veins of the ship. 

“Now the main laser array is going to start transferring the excess into orbital capacitors for the tear,” Samson explained, finally remembering the beautiful woman in his arms. “Believe it or not, the amount of power required for the jump is so disgustingly large that capacitance stations are needed to hold the energy for the initial particle acceleration to cause the tear. The scariest part is that most people think you’ll see the other end of the ‘wormhole’, even-though-that-isn’t-really-the-right-term, through the tear. They expect planets to be visible, when in actuality—it’s just a horrible all-encompassing blackness that we are going to sail right into. The tears can be very disquieting. Time gets all—wibbly-wobbly.”

Violet stared slack jawed as she slowly turned around to face Sam. 

“Way to make it sound like the most terrifying thing I’ve ever heard of!” 

“Oh, it’s not. The ship has made the journey plenty of times,” unloaded, Sam thought. “I don’t see any reason, according to concepts of quantum mechanics, as to why this one would be any different.” 

*Other than universal entropy and unpredictability, meaning that no two trips will ever be the same,* he continued in his mind.

“Okay then,” Violet smiled. “I suppose I’ll believe you, if you’re sure. We’re locked in now, anyway. I believe the final preparations have begun. That means no one can leave for any reason.”

“We’re both stuck here.”

“All alone,” Violet continued in the light of the stunning orbs shimmering on both sides of her. Sam allowed her to rotate her slim body in his grip. She slipped her arms around his neck and draped herself over his frame. Sam was by no means a large man, but when compared to the black-haired pixie, he seemed to be a giant. 

“Whatever shall we do?” Violet purred

“Well, I’m a bit disappointed by what we aren’t doing tonight. I know better than to defy your expectations twice.” 

Violet opened her smile and licked her upper lip softly as she rocked her head back and forth.

“I said we weren’t going to screw.”

Violet grinned and seemed to stream raw sex through her eyes into Sam’s. She continued in a voice just above a whisper.

“There are plenty of ways I’d like to get to know you that don’t involve that—actual—act.”

Sam couldn’t help letting a smile rise on his lips. He tried not to grin stupidly, but his mind and body weren’t cooperating. 

“Oh!” Violet giggled, “I see you have some ideas, too; big ones.” 

Sam pawed at Violet’s waist, entirely through with the pleasantries. The pixie let out an adorable gasp as she was whisked up into his arms. Her bare legs wrapped around his waist and she kicked her heels off onto the floor. A pair of light raps against metal followed as the black pumps clattered. Sam enjoyed bouldering in his spare time. He was especially strong for his weight class. He hefted her around the sealed room as though she were made of paper. He walked across the relatively bare employees-only space to a control panel that he switched off as she clung to him like a marsupial in heat. Violet dropped kisses down his neck and the colorful display went black. 

In a powerful motion, he cast her across the panel and breathed in her excitement. 

“Sam!” the lone word fell from her mouth like an aphrodisiac as powerful as any little blue pill there had ever been. 

With a brisk tug, the sparkling dress was freed from her shoulders and slithered to the floor. A low guttural *fuck* was summoned from her arched chest as his mouth moved down her exposed body. They were burning up with lust. That heat had almost nothing to do with the suns flanking the pair. 

If only the electricity from the fusion between Sam and Violet could have been harnessed as easily as humanity gleaned the power of the sun.

“They hate the tanks.”

Cleff sighed, without looking up from her data-slate as Friska’s familiar baritone reached her ear.

Which was, admittedly, a fairly impressive feat given all the noise around them. The embarkation of an entire regiment onto a ship was rarely a quiet or smooth process - and for all their other supposed talents, the Terran First was no exception on that front.

To others, Cleff imagined the sound of marching feet, shouting of orders, and roaring of idling engines might have been disorientating. To her, it was a glorious symphony. A thousand instruments swelling as one. More to the point, it was nostalgic. The closest thing to a migratory swarming a Triki girl like her might find outside the gleaming jungles of her homeworld.

*Of course, that eyesore does do a little to ruin that illusion,* she thought, staring up at the massive troop ship that her regiment was slowly loading into. Even as she watched, vehicles ladened with supplies streamed up the ramp and into the behemoth’s gargantuan cargo hold.

It really was an ugly ship.

She understood that aerodynamics didn’t actually have a place on a craft that predominantly spent its time deep in the void of space, but would it kill the Imperium to design some ships that didn’t look like oversized bricks?

Of course, her ruminations on Shil’vati design principles invariably brought her attention back to the Shil’vati captain who was still patiently waiting for a response from her CO.

“We’ve been over this, Captain,” Cleff said. “I’m not much of a fan of the machines either, but as I said, we’re stuck with them for the immediate future.”

Her part said, she returned her attention to the long list of facts and figures on the slate in her hand.

Which was why she was surprised when Friska continued. “No, you don’t get it. The crews, they like tanks  - they just really hate *these* tanks.”

Deciding that Friska was clearly going somewhere with this, Cleff sighed as she lowered her device, giving her underling her undivided attention.

“Alright then,” she hummed. “What *specifically* do they hate about the vehicles?The ones that I - and by extension they - have been saddled with?”

Apparently gratified that her CO was now properly paying attention to what she was saying, the Shil’vati woman stood up straight to make her pitch. “In short, they’re too big.”

*That’s it?* Cleff thought only her prior experience with the woman across from her kept her from snapping at the captain for wasting her time with the blatantly obvious when she was busy trying to load an entire regiment onto a ship.

“Yes,” the Colonel said simply. “I’m aware of that issue. They’re tanks. Of course, they’re big. That’s why the Imperium stopped using them.”

The Triki had never quite managed to reach the interstellar stage, but even before her people had been conquered by the Imperium, they had begun to phase out tanks as a viable weapon system. They were just too big and cumbersome for the modern battlefield.

*Like the armored knights of old,* she thought.

It was a recurring theme for most species. As soon as a civilization switched from cold weapons to hot - specifically, swords and spears to muskets and cannons – armor became less and less viable as offensive means outpaced defensive ones in effectiveness.

And by the time a civilization reached the interstellar stage, the gap in effectiveness was so hilariously lopsided that the only real defense against weapons fire was to avoid it entirely. By either hiding or evading it. Something tanks struggled to do in an era where ships could rain fire from orbit.

Space was the ultimate high ground, after all.

The fact that said orbital fire was not likely to be a factor on this deployment was the only reason she had consented to taking the vehicles at all – even then though, she did not have high expectations for the machines.

“Not that kind of...” Friska paused, before continuing. “Well, that as well. The problem they’ve been complaining about is that there’s too much wasted space in the vehicle’s interior.”

Cleff could barely believe her ears. “You’re saying that they want it to be *more* cramped?”

Her underling shrugged, as if to say, ‘humans’.

Which, given the exploits of their latest regimental champion, did actually convey quite a bit.

“Alright then,” Cleff said as she found her thoughts switching orientation. “Is there actually anything we can do about that? Obviously, we can’t change the shape of the machines enroute.”

She had to resist the urge to smile as Friska responded by pulling out a list. That was good. She’d clearly planned for this conversation. More to the point, it showed that she was genuinely listening to the soldiers under her command, rather than simply placating them.

After all, while Friska was the officer, she had little actual hands-on experience with the vehicles she was now expected to command. She’d, no doubt, been brushing up on her theory in the time since she’d discovered she’d be commanding tanks rather than Exos, but that couldn’t compare with direct experience. Which those under her command had.

Sure, the humans were primitive by Imperial standards, but in the area of heavy armor they likely had more experience than any Imperial commander alive.

“We can,” Friska said, eyes skimming over her notes. “Nothing revolutionary, of course. Not enough time or resources for a real retrofit. But we could install a few redundant systems. Sensors. Fire-control. Drone-storage. We can also use them as storage space for ammo-packs, parts, supplies… medical and otherwise.

Cleff’s antennae twitched thoughtfully. “Nix the drones. They won’t be able to fly in the conditions we’re expected to face.”

Friska did as instructed, striking off the item.

“The other things sound good, but medical supplies?” The colonel asked. “Are they running fighting vehicles or a bed and breakfast?”

She would have thought that the space – now that it was apparently available – would have been better served being filled with something more… vehicle focused. Medical supplies were something she’d imagine the infantry would want a greater supply of.

“Some of the crew have suggested that with the number of females present, we may suffer a higher rate of injury,” Friska said slowly.

Cleff actually twitched, before sniffing disdainfully. Of course, then she actually thought about it, rather than giving her wing-jerk reaction. Sure, it was a little strange to imagine the women of the regiment being the weaker link, but it was possible. Humans were strange like that.

“From what I’ve seen, humans don’t have that much in the way of sexual dimorphism relative to the rest of the galaxy,” she pointed out.

“The males are a little bigger and stronger on average.”

“Enough to make a difference?” Cleff asked.

“I honestly couldn’t say, ma’am.” Friska shrugged helplessly. “They look similar enough to me, but some of my people… well, they were quite insistent on the subject. I’d also note that amongst my ex-tankers, there are no females, so it seemed to have been a standing policy back on Earth.”

Cleff chittered irritably. She had enough problems on her plate without suddenly having to worry about gender politics.

Sure, there was a decent chance the humans were speaking from a place of reason and logic… but then again, she could also remember the amount of backlash there’d been back on Hruff when males had been allowed to serve in the military.

…And even centuries before that when wingless were allowed to serve.

“Get someone to look into it.” She finally decided. “Can’t say I’ve noticed any great disparity in the time they’ve been with us, but I can’t say I’ve been looking for it either.”

“Not been popping down to the medical tent to play the Noble in the Parlor with some sweet, wounded Earth-boy?” Friska asked coyly.

Cleff gave her a hard look, which had the Shil’vati straightening up as she was instantly reminded who she was speaking with.

“Hardly,” the colonel said, her voice as dry as Shil’s northern territories. “True or not, don’t let your people spread that kind of talk too far. Last thing we need is a divide over gender of all things.”

“Of course, ma’am,” Friska said quickly, back as straight as it could go.

Satisfied, Cleff hummed. “Back to our unwanted tanks though, from what I’m hearing they basically want to stuff their tanks full of spare material?”

“That is the essential truth of the matter. In different circumstances, I think there’s a ton of other things they’d want to change, but as you said, there's a limit to what we can do in the timeframe we have.”

Cleff nodded. “They’re soldiers, they’ll fight with what they have. Still, if they’re fine with turning those vehicles into cramped hellspaces, more power to them. You’ve got my permission, but I don’t want to hear any stories about crews dumping equipment because halfway through a mission they get a little claustrophobic.”

Friska smiled, some of her earlier cheer returning. “Somehow I doubt that will be an issue. They’re very spirited.”

Despite herself, Cleff found herself smiling in turn. Though, given the way Friska recoiled slightly, she doubted her grin displayed much in the way of mirth.

Just teeth.

“Good.”

\-----------

Jason grunted as he dumped another stack of data-slates onto the dolly drone. Once upon a time, he’d have thought his change in rank would allow him to escape this sort of menial labor. As it turned out, it didn’t. He was doing the same sort of work he’d have done as a private, just with more important stuff.

Case in point, he was in the middle of moving the entirety of the headquarters' ‘backup’ data slates. The things were built like a brick and had none of the bells and whistles of a regular data-slate, but they were designed to withstand just about anything. From an EMP to a fall from orbit.

Most importantly, each one was automatically updated with the contents of its assigned officer’s ‘primary data-slate’. Which only made sense, as it meant that should an officer’s original data-slate be lost or damaged – by something like an EMP – they could smoothly transition to the more heavy-duty variant.

Of course, that also meant that the devices were a huge security risk. Fancy security cyberware or not. Which was why, as the regimental champion, it was his duty to move them from headquarters and onto the ship.

Only he could be trusted with such an *important* task.

*I’m a steward,* he thought to himself as he dumped another of the devices onto the dolly drone. *A glorified steward.*

Wiping a stray bead of sweat from his forehead, he turned towards the open doorway.

“You could help, you know?” he called out.

“I’m guarding you,” Yaro called back, though he didn’t miss the slight snicker in her voice. “It requires my full attention.”

Of course, most stewards didn’t have a full-time guard detail. Or at least, one that was full-time while they were on deployment.

He was just turning back to his assigned duties when he caught movement out of the corner of his eye. Glancing over, he grinned.

“Well, at least one of my guards is nice,” he called out to Yaro, as the second member of his color guard started placing data-slates onto the drone – with a great deal more delicacy than Jason himself had been using.

From the doorway, Yaro just chuffed in amusement, but refused to move. Which was probably for the best. One of his guards helping could be excused, but someone did actually need to watch the door. Even if the chance of funny business in the middle of regimental headquarters was so small as to be effectively nil.

Looking at his newfound helper, he smiled. “Thanks, Nora.”

The blonde woman - whom he’d guessed to be some brand of Scandinavian - just grunted as she continued to methodically place slates onto the machine.

“No problem, Champion” she responded in halting Shil, her northern accent coming through in full.

“Is that a Danish accent?” he asked.

“Norwegian,” the woman said simply.

“Ah,” he paused.

The conversation lapsed into silence from there.

Which would usually be fine with him. He wasn’t exactly a talkative guy and if his newest guard was the same, then that was all the better.

Still, he found himself curious about the woman across from him. If only because she was the only human he’d had any prolonged contact with in some time.

She was attractive. It seemed fairly shallow that that was the first thing he’d notice about her, but it was: nice symmetrical features, honey gold and piercing blue eyes. He imagined some might describe her features as ‘marred’ by the ragged scar that ran up her chin, giving her lips just a hint of sneer, but he honestly thought it gave her some character.

*Older than most of the other recruits I’ve seen,* he noted. At a guess, he’d put her at late twenties, early thirties at the most.

And while she might not have been quite Shil’vati in size, she wasn’t exactly a slouch in that department either - in any respect.

Of course, he’d noted all that in a quiet, almost analytical manner. Because it was a recurring theme across the regiment. Sure, most of them were young and in shape, which went a hell of a long way, but even that had limits. No, just like with the large female component, he could feel the invisible hand of biased selection at work here.

Which, given that the Terran first was originally intended to be a parade regiment, he could sort of see that happening, but it still felt more than a little sleazy to see it done so blatantly.

“You’re wondering about the scar?”

The sudden words jolted him out of his thoughts.

“Pardon?” he asked.

“You were staring, Champion.”

In different circumstances, he imagined the words might have sounded accusatory, but if anything they just sounded bored. Like she had this conversation everyday. Which he supposed she very well might.

“Well, I suppose I am a bit curious?” he admitted.

He figured that was preferable to saying that he’d actually been wondering if some rear echelon motherfucker – or perhaps fatherfucker might be more apt? - had decided to stack their regiment with swimsuit models – of both varieties.

“Most are,” she allowed, running a finger along the divot in her flesh. “It’s from the first contact war.”

Jason almost hissed in surprise.

“Yes, that is the usual reaction I get.” She smiled. “Especially after showing up… here.”

Yeah, he could well believe that.

Sure, a lot more soldiers had survived the Shil’vati’s invasion than expected – the alien’s were pretty thorough in wiping out command posts in their first strike. Hell, it might have been the first war in history where those at the top of the chain of command were actively in more danger than those at the bottom.

That wasn’t to say that plenty of regular soldiers, airmen and seamen didn’t die in the war. Or in the fighting that led up to and followed Earth’s many disparate surrenders. There’d just been less death among the rank and file than might otherwise be anticipated.

So hearing that Nora was a survivor wasn’t the real shocker here.

“Why do it?” he asked, before he could stop himself.

The woman shrugged, moving another data-pad. “Why not? It’s a skillset I have, and one that the Imperium apparently needs. A job is a job. Soldiering just happens to be one that comes with more caveats.”

He could scarcely believe his ears.

“What about your, I don’t know, patriotism?”

“Never existed.” She glanced up at him. “What about yours?”

“My situation is complicated,” he immediately shot back.

“Hmmm,” she hummed in a disbelieving manner.

“It is!” he insisted.

Nora chuckled, a deep throaty thing. “What does it matter to people like you and I whose flag we march under? Human or alien, it’s all the same to us. Best we can do is live our lives. And at least in the Imperium I don’t have to worry about being held back because I’ve got tits.”

*No, just for being human,* he thought to himself. Despite that though, part of him agreed with her. Hell, a year ago he would have agreed entirely. It was like hearing his past self's own thoughts echoed back to him.

But it wasn’t a year ago. He’d seen things in his time in the Imperium.

Seen the nobility at work. Corruption. Classism. Sexism. Racism. The Imperium ran the gamut. And unlike pre-invasion America, didn’t even have to pay lip service to the notion of fairness. Which made it all the more heinous and blatant.

So blatant that even a nobody like him…

“Perhaps,” he allowed, cutting off that thought before it could fully form.

Nothing good would come from going down that road. Instead he simply shuffled another data-pad onto the dolly-drone. Nora seemed to take his words as agreement though, as she happily continued her own work.

The pair moved in silence for a few more minutes, before there was a shuffling at the door.

“Ma’am,” Yaro’s voice rang out.

“At ease,” Friska said, before her head popped into the doorway. “Champion, I need you for something.”

“Ma’am,” Jason responded with a salute, Nora doing the same.

“At ease,” the woman said casually. “I need you to find out if there’s a difference between boys and girls.”

“I can, uh, think off a few of the top of my head,” he said haltingly, deliberately trying to not glance at the woman’s rather impressive cleavage.

Which she immediately noticed, of course. “Cute,” she grinned. “But I specifically need to know your different specs.”

“Specs, ma’am?” he asked, noticing out of the corner of her eye that Nora suddenly seemed very interested in the conversation.

“A few of my boys have raised issues in regard to the performance of women in the regiment.”

Jason almost flinched at the way the Scandinavian woman’s expression turned distinctly stony at that. Would it have killed Friska to be a bit less blunt?

Ignorant, or perhaps just uncaring of the human woman’s growing outrage, the captain continued. “So now the colonel wants me to find out whether there’s any truth to their bellyaching, and if so, how much? Which is why I’ve come to you.”

“Right,” Jason said slowly, well aware that he’d essentially just been handed a live hand grenade and that he desperately wanted to pass it to someone else. “Wouldn’t that be something she should ask the medical staff though?”

Of course, he felt like an idiot the moment he said that. He’d clearly spent too much time on the *Whisker*.

As evidenced by the way Friska’s tone took on a hint of seriousness. “No, that would be something she would ask me, who in turn has asked you, who in turn will ask the medical staff, who will in turn report those findings back to me, before I summarize them to her. At which point, she will make a decision.”

He flinched at the fairly unsubtle reminder of the degrees of rank between himself and the colonel. Even if the role of Champion occupied a fairly nebulous spot in the military hierarchy.

“I’ll get on it, ma’am,” he said seriously.

At the response, Friska nodded, her usual jovial smile coming back. “Good. Have that report sent to my data-pad by tomorrow morning.”

And just like that she was gone.

Exhaling a breath he didn’t know he’d been holding, Jason looked over the now fully loaded dolly-drone. “Well, I suppose we should get these up to the *Gentle River’s* command deck.”

Then it was down to medical, for what no-doubt promised to be a very awkward conversation.

Kaden’s mouth was agape 'not only are there aliens, not only are they peaceful but they also wish to exchange tech and ideas with humanity wow this is going to be brilliant' 

 Now on the screen was a insectoid like alien that had a humanoid torso with its abdomen coming out of its back where its ass would have been if it where human with four  legs coming from the abdomen and two arms on the torso the head was round ish and it had two compound eyes on the side of its head it also had what apered to be a exosuit going across its body 

""greetings people of earth I am captain vree tark of the dak kai peoples I come to represent the GC or the galactic commonwealth it is so good to finally meet your wonderful people"" 

""welcome captain it is nice to meet you I'm just going to start asking questions now "" 

The captain did a shake of his exoskeleton and his antenna twitched kaden wasn't sure if he was nervous or happy but he was betting towards nervous 

""how long have you know about us since we have sentout messages and unmanned spacecraft deliving messages surly you must of heard or found one"" the news reporter said

There was another twitch of the antenna and sake of the exoskeleton 

""um we've know about humanity for about ten of your earth years usually we greet a species after one year but you guys are very unique see (he took along  pause and the let out a long sigh) humanity are the first species ever recorded to be found on a death world a world to dangerous to harbor civilisations let alone multiple unique cultures and languages and since humanitys history is literd with a prepencity for violence it really divided us about what we where going to do with you my people where in favor of first contact""

The reporter was stunned but kaden couldn't watch the TV anymore he packed his bag and went of to school thinking 'wonder what' ll change now propabluy nothing in our little corner of the world '",/r/HFY/comments/p7xefi/the_deathworlders_are_coming_the_deathworlders/,9
86,p8602u,HFY,Fri Aug 20 17:11:49 2021,Ass Drivers 8: The Spy Who Pooped Me,"The diplomats were left to find more talkative Læøt and hash out a proper surrender. That kind of bullshit was not for a military fleet - and the Læøt had been in an absolute state of disorder when the First Expeditionary Fleet had warped out of their homeworld system.

Now, Assembly bylaws technically do not say that you can’t bring an armada to the unity stations.

...but they don’t say you should either.

Still, neither Marco nor the Fleet Admiral liked the idea of a fake Marco filching ass driver schematics, so while Unity System Control was screaming at them, the Triton placed itself in a parking orbit near Unity Station five, while the rest of the fleet politely parked itself a bit further away.

With a detachment of marines who looked very ready to shoot, sodomize or otherwise exercise violence on whoever they were aimed at, Marco arrived in a shuttle to many a stink-eye from the staff at the arrival checkpoint. The marines were ready, eager, willing and likely all sporting half-chubs, bantering amongst themselves as the hatch opened. Marco mainly just picked up on a couple of their nicknames, being a POG and whatnot.

“The unity stations are off limits to… invasion forces. Go away” said the shrill sounding schlu customs clerk, appearing very displeased with the two dozen well-muscled and heavily armed goons plus officers who had just marched up to her booth.

Marco frowned: “I am a TC navy captain, here to investigate a situation at the TC delegation offices. We might have a Læøt infiltration on our hands”

All six of the schlu’s lobes turned pale at the mention of the Læøt: “But.. they aren’t allowed in the unity system - so that’s impossible”

“I suspect that they don’t care about assembly restrictions on that - now open the gate for us, or I’ll have lance corporal Thundercheeks squeeze out a breaching charge”

One of the marines perked up and clenched up at the mention of his nickname.

The schlu pushed a button, the gate into the station proper from the hangar swinging open to the chug of hydraulics.

“Alright, move out - the station rail is right over here” Marco ordered, recalling well the layout from station five where he had originally met Sanchez and Jhet. All the unity stations were built identically, so they were easy to navigate when going from one to the other.

A lot of aliens looked very frightened as Captain Marco and the marines rode on a hover tram to the station six diplomatic residential district. The estates there were palatial, and once they arrived at the address Marco had managed to squeeze out of FleetSec, he felt a strange case of Deja Vu: “Hold on… we’re on station six, right?”

“Yes sir”

“But that… those statues - that’s Consul Sanchez’s shit from station five”

“He got the late delegation head’s job after she was a assassinated, sir”

“Oh…”

Approaching the residence, the human guards there seemed to recognize Marco from station five: “Greetings Captain, what’s with the magic mike patrol?”

“FleetSec told me there’s someone crimping my style - I’m here to smack a bitch, gotta keep my pimp hand strong”

“Righteous - I’ll call the rep head up, tell him you’re coming” the guard said, stepping back and tapping his helmet comm.

It didn’t take many seconds before Marco recognized the face of a confused man.

“What do you mean he’s already here? I’ve got the captain out here, with two dozen marines who are looking at me like I just dropped the soap - quit squeezing my roids here maam”

“Trouble private?”

“Sir, captain - head of security won’t authorize your entry. Says you’re already here”

The guard explained that he hadn’t seen anyone else who looked like Marco arrive - but there had just been a change of guard, so it was probably the last shift who’d seen that happen.

Pulling out his own comm, Marco tapped it a bit and hoped that Sanchez hadn’t changed his callsig since station five. A few beeps later, and a hologram of Juan Carlos Sanchez, the new head of the TC assembly delegation, appeared floating above Marco’s comm: “Hey Marco, you done down in archives?”

Marco’s face and sphincter both clenched: “Sanchez old friend, I’m afraid you’ve been hustled - I’m standing outside your new loveshack here, with two dozen marines who can attest to me being the real me. I’m here to detain the fake one you’ve got inside”

Sanchez’s eyes went wide, after which his hologram flipped around as he appeared to look around from Marco’s comm: “You, private - let these people in, then lock down the whole compound!”

“Sir, I need authorization from the head of security to do that - and she said that these guys out here can’t be for real” the spooked guard said, not sounding happy to be caught between a rock and a hard place.

“Private, I will see your head uncorked and front-loaded with the latest of whatever weapons grade feces Marco has cooked up - everyone inside, lockdown, now!”

The doors were opened, and Marco and the marines doubled timed it inside. The last marines had barely managed to fall in when an angry looking and sounding lady came stomping in, though ‘stomping’ in high heels was a bit of a storm in a tea-cup: “Who the hell let you in?”

Of course, the first thing Marco noticed was that the woman wasn’t quite human - and judging from her office casual outfit, she was some clerk or something: “Sanchez did. Do y-”

Before Marco could get another word in, the alien woman - her lobes all curled up and frilly - shrieked: “Security! We have armed intruders in the main hall”

That was when the alarm lights started blinking. As per assembly norms, warning lights were bright blue - not red as was more the norm among humans - and the main hall was quickly swarmed with armed human guards and blinking blue lights.

Marco was not impressed, and the marines looked even more uncomfortable, their leader - a lieutenant who had earned his scars wrestling Læøt on several occasions - asked: “Orders sir?”

“Stand down, for the time being - you all saw Sanchez invite us in”

“Guards, disarm these intruders and escort them outside for station security to deal with” the alien woman commanded.

Frowning in such a way that it looked a bit as if his glorious Mexican moustache was wiggling for a brief moment, Marco looked around at the guards to see if he could spot anyone who looked in charge. No, all of them looked like grunts: “Right, can any of you tell me who the harpy is - Sanchez told the guards outside to let us in”

The guards looked… apprehensive? None of them appeared to want to answer the question, and a few began moving towards Marco and the marines, their firearms raised.

“Sir? Permission to make the news?” the lieutenant inquired, referring to the somewhat unofficial term for doing something that stupid, messy or violent that was going to make headlines. In this case it was pretty obvious that he meant to resist the guards and start a fight.

For a tense moment Marco weighed his options. He had no idea what the imposter was doing - Sanchez had mentioned some archives - and this was smelling really fishy to him. Of course, ordering his men to shoot their fellow kin was bound to result in all kinds of trouble just the same…

Looking around, Marco saw that several of the guards had slowly inched their way close enough to the marines to be in reach of their guns - and some of them were even cautiously reaching for them.

Taking a deep breath, Marco wondered if making a mess of things here would work out like the other times when he’d just end up getting another medal? No, this would result in humans getting killed… this would end badly no matter what. Turning ever so slightly, Marco opened his mouth to speak to the Lieutenant when Sanchez came thundering down the stairs shouting: “The fuck is going on here?”

Marco snapped around, while at the same time several of the guards snatched just as many battle rifles away from the marines.

“Dxk, what is the meaning of this?” Sanchez bellowed, his fancy suit looking even fancier than the outfit Marco had seen him last time.

The alien woman, Dxk, looked at Sanchez with aloof disinterest: “You ordered a lockdown without consulting me, and I discovered a group of armed intruders in the main hall - what did you expect me to conclude?”

Sanchez shot the alien woman a furious gaze: “I expect you to ask for identification - this is my main man Captain Marco Iglecias, hero of the battle of Clenched Cheeks, and a personal friend of mine!”

“Can’t be - he checked in at the front desk three hours ago. You met him yourself and vouched for him” the alien stated firmly.

With furious gestures Sanchez had the guards return the weapons to the marines, after which he inquired: “Proud soldiers of earths, can you attest that this is the real Captain Marco?”

They all shouted, in unison: “Yes sir!”

“You are not going to take that as proof that this one is the real one, are you? Please don’t tell me you’re that much of an idiot?” The alien said, loud enough for everyone to hear, but not in a shouty way.

Marco shook his head: “Hey ese, who’s the buzzkill?”

“She is my head of security - some kind of assembly bylaw, have to be of a different species than your own. I think it’s stupid as hell. She’s fleep” Sanchez groaned, dismissing the guards.

Dxk nodded.

“Right, but she does have a point - can you prove that you’re really… you? Tell me something that some enemy spy couldn’t have seen from your press tour”

Marco pondered for a moment: “You… once bragged to me that you still had the now late delegation head’s panties, and the first time we ate together at the consulate there were berries which did turn my shit blue for three days”

Sanchez grew a mighty smile, embracing Marco as if family: “My boy! But this means we have a spy down in the archives! It’s down the stairs to the left, second sub-level!”

“Right - marines, on me!” Marco commanded, double-timing it towards the stairs.

The basement levels of the estate appeared to be mostly storage, at least initially. A lot of junk and personal possessions from the late delegation head, and possibly from previous delegations that had inhabited the place.

Of course, a landscape of crates and chest-high boxes made for a great place to spring an ambush, so Marco and the marines advanced carefully.

“Shit, what’s that?” One marine cried out, training his rifle and its attached flashlight to some kind of alien monster that seemed to have appeared out of nowhere.

A dozen other rifles and their lights swung around to aim at the same target - but it remained… motionless.

Marco walked up to the stuffed alien creature, pushing it a bit: “Nope, it’s Chuck Testa - now move on!”

Down another level they began hearing noises: “Sir… what is that?”

“It’s coming from the archive vault!”

Getting closer it became evident that the sound was from… drilling.

“The hell are they drilling in there? It’s an electronic data vault, not a bank vault” one marine commented.

Marco shrugged: “Maybe they found Sanchez’s porn stash and are trying to put themselves out of their misery?”

The marines chuckled as they lined up around the very much locked from the inside armored door into the data-vault. Marco considered his options: “Lance corporal Thundercheeks,  squeeze me out a breaching charge”

Squatting down and attaching a long line of freshly formed boomex as it came out of the extruder attached on his back, the demolition specialist wrapped it up by stepping well away from the vault door and crying out: “Fire in the hole!”

Everyone held their ears as the shaped explosives burned the hinges of the massive door. It wasn’t a “boom” type explosive, more like a fifteen-second very hot incineration, which melted through the massive steel hinges, but it still involved a lot of smoke and heat.

Pulling on the by then quite hot vault door, the massive thing fell over with a floor-crunching boom - which was followed by a lot of heavily armed and armored marines swarming inside.

There was a brief exchange of weapons fire and the clatter of brass - it seemed that the imposter had two aliens with him, but they quickly found themselves somewhat permanently distracted by sucking chest wounds.

The vault’s ventilation system kicked in a few seconds later, clearing the smoke. The two goons were hauled out for medical treatment, while the imposter… well… he looked eerily well like Marco.

“This is fucking weird…” the feces-famous captain said, looking at his... clone?

The Marco hiding behind a server rack, dressed in a TC navy officers uniform, looked very frightened: “Please, they were holding me hostage”

Well that was strike one - sort of: The imposter was speaking with a notably generic western american accent, not Marco’s mexican accent.

“Try again cup-cape - you’re coming with us” Marco said, grabbing the guy and hauling him out of the vault.

Sanchez appeared happy that the situation had been… resolved? No? The marines had spotted a device attached to the servers once everyone had cleared out and picked up their brass.

“That looks like a MuugTech transmitter, I’ve seen those before - but the datavault is shielded. You can’t use those things in here” Sanchez mused.

Looking around the vault and spotting the drilling equipment, Marco examined the hole drilled in the wall: “That’s probably why they put an antenna through here… look, this wire connects to the transmitter”

“Well shit - can we see what they were broadcasting?” Sanchez wondered, sounding very much like he didn’t want to know.

A technician from the estates IT department was brought in, who quickly confirmed that the thing was encrypted out the ass: “Can’t tell you what had put on this or what they were sending, but I can tell you that they’ve only sent a little under eighty percent… and if it’s any of our confidential files then they’ll need the whole file to collate and open them, eighty percent is useless. And they’re pushing a lot of data through here, it’ll take them at least another half hour to finish the upload”

“Great, pull the plug and stop it!” Sanchez said, sounding quite relieved.

Marco objected: “Hold on - we don’t know who is receiving… and I would really like to be able to grab them too. Can you trace where it’s being sent?”

The technician shrugged: “Sorry sir - I can’t. This thing wasn’t made for people accessing it once it’s started. I think it was pre-programmed to find whatever it’s sending and then relay it to the receiver. This is a very simple device, there’s very little computer power in it”

“Pre-programmed… do you think it’ll be able to detect if the files it’s sending are tampered with?” Marco wondered, looking all kinds of sneaky.

Sanchez gave Marco a curious look: “What are you thinking?”

“Marines! - I need a comm wire and a remote hookup going from in here upstairs to where we can get a steady commsig to the fleet!” Marco called out.

A bit of wirework later, and Marco was able to contact people on the outside from inside the data vault: “This is Captain Igecias to the Triton, I need FleetSec on the line and I need Fleetsec really fucking fast”

A few seconds on hold later, Marco was talking to someone from FleetSec. To Sanchez it sounded like very technical talk - something far beyond his ken - but he could see from the data-lights on the comm wire that data was being transmitted into the vault.

Marco then accessed the data vault and started looking up some data logs: “There we go… figures, they were accessing Ass Driver specs. Why the fuck are these files in the delegation head’s datavault to begin with?”

“Judging from the directory then it’s another leftover from Seoa’s administration - but yes, it does raise some rather uncomfortable questions - plus if that gizmo was pre-programmed then someone had told these spies where to look for the files” Sanchez mused, not sounding very happy with the implications.

Marco shrugged: “I’ll leave that to FleetSec and your own spooks to figure out - right now the people receiving these files are in for a nasty surprise… say, do any of you know what the broadcast range on this transmitter is?”

The technician noted that the MuugTech device was rated for about five hundred meters - it was basically a glorified alien wifi-hub.

“Perfect - marines, I need you all up topside listening for when this goes off. Grab ‘em and bring them in” Marco ordered, most of the marines quickly moving out, leaving four to keep guard over the imposter and the two wounded aliens who were getting patched up outside the vault by the in-house medical staff.

Sanchez looked at Marco: “What did you just do?”

“I replaced the schematic files with some viruses, courtesy of FleetSec. Once the people on the other end have the whole package and try to recompile it they’ll start blasting mariachi music” Marco said, smiling like a mad cunt.

Smirking, Sanchez nodded: “To make them reveal themselves… of course - oh this I’ve got to see”

Taking an elevator up to the second floor, Sanchez guided Marco to a balcony. Pulling out a set of binoculars with some built in audio and range detector gizmos, Marco scanned the area: “Any second now…”

The marines were fanning out from the estate, making quite a lot of civilians who were walking by scatter - but Sanchez assured Marco that he would handle the fallout from having armed soldiers running around the residential district.

Suddenly an alien couple who had been cuddling each other on a bench on the other side of the road had their comm start blasting mariachi music at an ear-shredding volume. It sounded loud even to Marco up on the balcony, up on the second floor, on the other side of the street. They were brought in at gun-point, and Sanchez called in a shuttle to quickly get everyone out of his hair so he could smooth things over with station security.

Back on the Triton, the interrogation of the five captured jokers began.

The two aliens from the bench were quickly processed: They were fully cooperative, saying that they had been approached by an alien who was identified as one of the two goons taken with the imposter. He had asked them to chill at the bench for a bit with the offending comm unit on them. They had been paid well for the service, but didn’t appear to have any idea what they had been part of, and had originally been instructed to give the alien his comm back later that day at a cafe elsewhere on the station. Their identities were confirmed by station security as adolescent civilians, and thus they were turned over to their parents.

The three remaining aliens… they were a bit more tricky.

The two who had been shot, one of which had been identified as having given the comm to the two teenagers, weren’t talking. They were both Fni, which was easy enough to tell based on their woolen fur and the shape of their noses. Of course, having shot at TC marines meant they were in all kinds of deep shit.

The imposter… well… he was just weird.

Outside the holding cell, Marco, the fleet admiral, a FleetSec officer and Jhet discussed their options. The admiral was quite confused, looking at the medical rapport from the Lijkin’s medical staff: “The bloodwork and even on a genetic level... Captain are you sure you don’t have some long-lost one-egged twin?”

“Ooi medical scanners don’t lie - it’s the best medtech you can get from any assembly species. I swear by the stuff. I mean, it fixed Marco’s face” Jhet noted, sounding as perplexed as everyone else.

The FleetSec officer shrugged: “It’s alien tech - its pretty damn obvious that this is some alien intelligence op, so I don’t trust those readouts”

Marco didn’t know what to think: “Jhet, is it normal for assembly species to spy on each other?”

“As much as human nation states used to - or still do. Nobody likes falling behind technologically, and digging up dirt for political gain or blackmail is quite common. Still, I’ve never heard of someone being able to produce a double like this - a lot of politicians will shit themselves if this is the case” Jhet said, shaking her head in disbelief, the many gold rings on her four ears jingling softly.

The admiral frowned and walked off: “Marco, I leave this up to you - but I want answers. We’re on a wartime footing, so there’s very little you can’t do, but I’d prefer this one stays alive if we need to hand him over to whoever his masters are”

Taking a deep breath, Marco looked at Jhet and the FleetSec officer: “I think… I think I need some me-time… with myself, but do keep him cuffed and chained up”

“Where would you like him?” The FleetSec officer asked, sounding perfectly ready to deposit the prisoner wherever Marco wanted to interrogate him.

Of all the places on the Triton, the FleetSec officer had not expected Marco’s old weapons blister. In fact, quite a lot of FleetSec staff objected to bringing an enemy spy into an ass driver blister.

“Don’t worry - the only thing he can see is the ammo hopper. Everything else has been centralized at this point” Marco noted.

The hatch to the blister locked and made the mechanical noises as it sealed itself. Marco looked at… himself. It was really eerie, but at the same time the spy had an unmistakable angry look in his eyes. He might not be talking, but it was saying a lot with that look in his eyes.

“You wanted to learn about the ass driver? Well here you are… this is my old duty station, where I invented the shit based ammunition for it” Marco said, gesturing firmly but politely.

Opening a hatch, Marco inspected the hopper - it smelled about as well as what one would expect an ammo hopper that was routinely filled with shit would: “Well, they have made a lot of upgrades since last time I worked here… but it’s working a lot better than back then”

The double remained silent, but he was looking…

That’s when Marko grabbed the double and hauled him up to the hopper hatch: “How about you have a closer look?”

The double struggled, but he was in chains and mag-cuffs, so he wasn’t going anywhere but head-first into the hatch.

“You can really smell that they outsourced the taco Tuesdays to the lowest bidder, right? How about you have a closer look?” Marco said, grabbing the manual override valve.

Humming himself a cheerful tune while cycling about six cubic meters of shit through the hopper, his double spasmodically jittering and jerking around while being poop-pummeled, Marco finally shut the valve and pulled stinky out of the crapper: “Ready to talk, or do I need to demonstrate our blackwater separation system too? That stuff stings”

The double coughed, shivering and wide-eyed.

“I could show you this thing I’ve been tinkering with over at the firing range, I think we’ll call it the scatling gun. You’ll love it - I’ll even let you be target practice. I promise I’ll dial the fibre setting up so you’re not shit-hit too hard” 

The double whimpered, sinking to his knees: “Alright… I’ll talk”

Hauling the shit-smeared spy out of the blister, Marco handed him over to an astonished set of  FleetSec officers: “How did you make him talk?”

“I did like in those old spy movies. Gave him the Casino Royale Flush, showed him my License to shit” Marco in a chuckle.

The intelligence officers nodded and smirked: “Right, gave him the old Brownfigner”

“Nah mate, looks more like he got From Toilet with Love”

Marco laughed: “All good guesses, but honestly it was more of a Shitfall - he had No Time To Flush. It was quite the View to a Shit”

“Alright, get buttraker here to a shower and then get him into an interrogation room!” one of the FleetSec officers commanded, struggling not to giggle.

Marco left the double to the tender mercies of the FleetSec interrogators, returning to the bridge.

Comms turned out to have a message for him there: The Læøt, after some additional factional infighting, had sued for peace now that the runtimes that had commanded war had been terminated.

A few days later the body double was brought to the unity stations, where Delegation Head Sanchez handed him over to a very cross Ooi representative, who seemed to be primarily upset that the Ooi had now been revealed to possess such strange body-altering technology. 

Marco cared little for the news of the political ramifications of the reveal, he had an alien catgirl waiting for him in his quarters in a schrödingers state of undress.

It was good to be the king.

The End.

20,patx0d,HFY,Tue Aug 24 22:05:30 2021,Semper Shil'vati: An SSBverse Story: Chapter 28: Reconciliation,"Angry. Befuddled. Shocked. Amazed. But above all else, cheers of excitement erupted throughout the Observation Room. For the first time in a decade, they had triumphed over the Interior Academy on the training field. They had watched as their recruits climbed aboard the MCU and began dragging out the occupants, one by one, while others had radioed in the surrender or elimination of the remaining Interior cadets. The Drill Instructors, the Commanding Officers, Major Mal’Ava, and Staff Sergeant Kolani were cheering alongside them. The only people not present however, were the Commanding General, the senior-most enlisted on the base, and Agent Talaris. After seeing the two attempted rapes of their recruits by the cadets, they had gotten into immediate contact with the Commanders at the Academy and began to demand an explanation, and punishment for those responsible. An undoubtedly poor and one-sided call to be on the receiving end of, if one was prone to empathy. To all those present there, though, it just gave a little extra spice to the victory.

But now, in the room? Everyone was cheering jubilantly at the crushing victory the Interior had been handed.

“I told you they’d pull through,” Major Mal’Ava said, looking over at Captain Ov’Ari, who simply nodded.

“I guess you were right Ma’am, I didn’t expect the exercise to end like *that,* though. Where in the Sea of Souls did they come up with ideas like that?”

“You know how the Humans are,” one of the DI’s said. “They love that asymmetric warfare shit.”

“Yeah, they do,” Kolani said, frowning slightly. “It's not like they would’ve won in a straight-up fight. But some of these tactics have been used before on Earth.” She shrugged.

“It doesn’t matter now, we kicked the Interior’s sorry asses, and they can’t brag about it anymore!” SDI Varalin said with much joy in her voice.

“I hear that, girl, and I can’t wait to see how they’ll try and spin *this!”* SDI Prisma said.

“They can’t downplay a loss this bad, they just have to woman up and take it,” SDI Ches’aka added. The cheers began to subside, and the various Seniors got on the comm network to tell their recruits to head back to the evacuation zones to be transported back to the staging areas. All seemed to be going well at first, the suits of both Marine and Interior exited the lock up protocol, and everyone got back to their feet. Grunts and curses of displeasure from Interior cadets, and cheers of joy from Marine Recruits.

""What the fuck are Recruit Akio and Recruit Johan doing?"" Captain Ov'Ari asked, watching the feed with confusion. She looked, and they were still standing atop the MCU, arms out to their sides, and standing dead still.

""They are mocking them,"" Kolani said, chuckling a bit.

""I can see that, but what is it they are doing?"" Now Kolani flushed slightly, before responding to the Captain.

""I'm a big fan of Human video games, especially ones with large teams on both sides fighting it out for supremacy. And one thing I’ve noticed while playing is that the winning team's members usually do that over the corpses of their enemy. Or, at least, it's one of the things they do. This specifically, they call it 'T-Posing',"" Kolani explained, chuckling internally at the look of befuddlement on the officer's face, before she shook her head and focused back on the screen.

“And what is that one called?” Ov’Ari asked, mouth agape as she watched another Human drop their head into a slanted position, and raise their arm out in a parallel direction.

“They call that one ‘dabbing’,” Mal’Ava answered. “Another mocking technique used by Humans in video games.”

“So Human men enjoy video games as much as we do?”

“Very much so. It's mostly their women who don’t enjoy playing them as much, but even then it's a small difference.” Mal’Ava smirked before turning to the Captain. “After all, my boyfriend loves playing them, as do most men he knows.”

“Then maybe I will try one after all, if they really are that similar to a woman.” Mal’Ava, as well as a few others in the room, frowned at Ov’Ari’s choice of words.

“You don’t get to just ‘try one’, they aren’t fucking sex toys, Captain,” Mal’Ava scolded her.

“Attitudes like that are exactly what made the occupation of Earth all the more difficult for us,” Kolani added.

“And many of us have learned that the hard way,” Drill Instructor Rayna said. “Treat them with respect, not as some stiffy in the red light districts of periphery worlds.” Ov’Ari just shrugged in response.

“It's whatever. I doubt I’d be able to find one attracted to me anyway.” She sighed. “Never thought I’d ever hear so many men say our breasts are oversized to the point it's unattractive.” Before she could continue her bitching and moaning, a sudden shout from one of the camera feeds snapped their attention back to the feeds in front of them.

*“Watch out!”* Recruit Johan yelled over the comms, and all eyes went back to the camera feeds. An Interior cadet, who had crawled out of the driver’s compartment of the MCU, had pulled out a knife, and was swinging it towards Recruits Anatoly and Zachary. Adrenaline having worn off, Anatoly staggered back after dodging a swing from the woman. Zachary lunged forward, parrying her next swing, but being unlucky enough to be on the receiving end of a second swing, slicing diagonally across his chest. A cut that was far from shallow. Blood flew across the ground as the knife sliced through the flexi fiber and into Zachary’s flesh.

*“I’LL FUCKING KILL YOU!”* Zachary screamed, catching her arm as she tried stabbing towards him and tossing her to the ground. The knife tumbled down, and he jumped on her back, landing blow after blow until Alistair, William, and Siva ripped him off her and tossed him back. He tried standing up, only for copious amounts of blood to start pouring down his chest from the knife wound. He staggered, then sat back down. It was only by virtue of a Shil’vati medic catching him that he didn’t completely topple on his ass.

Two Drill Instructors had also arrived, restraining the assailant with a quick shot to her arm and relocking her suit. Now curses and shouts were being traded back and forth, and more support personnel were arriving to help contain the situation and provide initial medical support to those who needed it.

“I’M GOING TO STOMP THAT BITCH'S SKULL IN!” Mal’Ava screamed at the screen, before bolting out of the room, intending to get down there to her man. Her man who had just been sliced across the chest by an angry Interior Cadet’s knife. Kolani followed in tow, as well as SDI Prisma, Captain Ov’Ari, and a number of other personnel. They had all had quite enough of this shit.

\-

When word finally got around to all the recruits about what had happened to Recruit Anatoly and Recruit Victor, the previously cheerful expressions many of them held, turned to pure disdain. The incident with the Interior driver slashing Recruit Zachary across the chest didn’t help the situation either. Despite the crowing of Major Ak’sis, the Drill Instructors refused to let either the driver, or the other four Interior recruits they had detained, go.

The situation turned into a tense standoff that was only getting worse as the seconds ticked by. The Interior Commander, as well as the Commanding General, were present, as were a number of armed Instructors on both sides, and Officers as well. Agent Talaris, as well as another unnamed Interior Agent, stood on the side of the Marines, scowling fiercely at their opposition. Soon, another shuttle arrived, this time ferrying a number of Senior Drill Instructors, the Commanding Officer, as well as Major Mal’Ava, and Staff Sergeant Kolani. Upon hopping, or in Mal’Ava’s case, jumping out of the shuttle before it had landed, made her way over towards the driver, and slammed a powerful right hook directly into her jaw. She followed up with a left, then another right, before she got pulled off by surrounding Marines.

“ENOUGH!” the Commanding General snapped, looking at Mal’Ava for only a moment before returning her gaze directly to the Interior Commander, which sent a chill up the spines of many present. “Twice. *Twice* in this exercise your cadets have tried raping our recruits, and you refused to reprimand them on the training field for what they had done. After we called your side and alerted you, you did nothing. It took our own recruits taking matters into their own hands to stop it, and now, one of yours assaults another of my recruits with a knife? All because you lost the exercise? Now, what I want to know is this: what do you intend to do about it? Especially since we have proof of it!” she said with a level of scorn and disgust none of them had ever heard from the General.

“They will be dealt with!” the Interior Commander said through gritted teeth, an equal level of scorn and hatred on her face directed back at the CG. The Interior had no real way out of this one as it stood. If they wanted to maintain the illusion of the social contract, something had to give. It didn’t help that at least half a dozen different recruits had the incident recorded, and deleting those would be next to impossible. Or that there were Interior agents on the side of the Marines, who had watched the whole thing. “Now if you’ll release my women, we can go about retrieving our gear, and dealing with our own. she said, turning back to her own and giving rapid fire commands that most of the Humans couldn’t follow.

“But Ma’am, they de-” Major Ak’sis tried to argue, but was shut down hard by the Commander.

“SHUT YOUR MOUTH, MAJOR!” she roared, causing the woman to shrink back in fear and embarrassment. “THIS IS THE FAULT OF YOUR UNDISCIPLINED TROOPS!” As she continued to berate the Major, many of the Marines noticed two things. First was that as the injured and restrained Interior cadets were handed off, the way they were treated was split firmly down the middle. Half of the cadets glared angrily at the Marines, while the others had looks of disgust and contempt written across their faces for their comrades.

But that wasn’t something they kept their focus on for too long. The transports were arriving on site, and some recruits had to be brought to medical for treatment of their wounds. Celebrations would have to be put on hold, much to the disappointment of many of the cadre and militia members, but they all understood. Still, even Anatoly, Victor, and Zachary, wanted to celebrate their victory over the Interior.

“'Tis but a scratch!” Zachary chuckled, although the action aggravated the wound and sent more pain stabbing through his chest. He looked up, and saw the concerned faces of both Mal’Ava and Kolani standing over him. He gave them a weak smile. “It's been a while since I’ve seen you, babe. Didn’t think I’d see you this soon, though.” He tried standing up, only for the medic treating him to force him back down.

“Sit down, you idiot!” the medic hissed at him. “This wound might not be very deep, but it isn’t shallow, either, and you getting up isn’t going to make this easier. Now sit still!” she ordered, and he reluctantly obeyed. Another medic soon arrived and they began to take his suit off, starting with the helmet, then his top, to get a full examination of the wound. Despite his wound, a great many women chose to stare at the bare-chested male in front of them, something that irritated the medics, Humans, and a number of officers.

“Look away and show some fucking decency you clam-brained idiots!” the other medic snapped, causing many to look away, but not all. That was when the officers stepped in.

“Did you not fucking hear her? Look away now!” Mal’Ava snapped, followed by other officers barking at the remaining recruits and militia, giving the injured some peace as their wounds were tended to by the medics.

“How quickly can you patch me up, doc?” Zachary asked. “I don’t want to miss the party with the rest of our friends here. That, and I want to know whether or not strenuous activity is permitted.” He paused, looking up at Mal’Ava before speaking again. “I promised my girlfriend I’d rock her world come graduation, and I’m not going back on that promise.”

“And I refuse to let anything happen to either of you!” SDI Prisma said, marching over to where he was sitting. She took her own helmet off, and levelled her gaze to meet his own. “Now you stay down and let the medical staff take care of you,” she said firmly, her tone declaring she wouldn’t accept anything but total obedience.

“Yes, Senior Drill Instructor,” Zachary responded, wincing as the medics began applying gel and cleaning the bits of his suit that were stuck in his wound.

“And I refuse to let anything happen to you, Recruit. There’s been enough Turox shit happening for one day, and we’re all sick of it. Now stay down, and rest, Goddess knows you need it after all this. That is an order!” Mal’Ava said sharply, her tone and facial expression leaving no room for argument.

“Yes, ma’am!” Zachary nodded, not protesting, and letting the medics work their magic. The blade mark that ran across his chest started underneath his left pec, and went diagonally to just over his right. Luckily, Shil’vati medical technology and gels were well above that of Earth’s. The gel they applied had clotted the wound, and would begin the healing process of the flesh there. That alone wouldn’t do the job completely, but he wouldn’t be down nearly as long as he would have before the First Contact War.

“However, I’m confident they’ll have you and Recruit Anatoly ready for action as soon as possible, so that you may join your comrades in celebration, won’t they?” Mal’Ava continued, a hint of danger in her tone of voice towards the medics. Her statement was pretty clear. ‘Get them healed now or you’ll regret it’. Mama Bear was done taking shit and seeing Papa Bear getting hurt. She wanted her man back, and she was sick of seeing Zachary getting injured. The protective instinct towards males that all Shil’vati had, kicked into high gear when she saw it happen. A lesson she had taught to Ka’Varik for fucking with him, and a lesson she imparted on the Interior Cadet who had slashed him across the chest.

“Yes ma’am, we’ll get them the best treatment on base!” the first medic answered hurriedly. “At the latest, they will be ready for graduation!” she assured Mal’Ava, clearly understanding her tone of voice, and what was behind it. As the medics were getting ready to load Zachary up into a medical transport, they noticed a necklace around his neck, and tried taking it off.

“Not a chance!” Zachary said, gripping the woman’s hand tightly, just inches away from the necklace. The necklace, a Cross mixed with a Star of David, was an old family heirloom, a symbol signifying the religious background of his ancestors, and how they came to meet, despite their differences. Half Irish Catholic, half Polish Jewish was the blood that ran through his veins, and that necklace was further proof of it. He stared the medic directly in her eyes as she looked down at him. “Let go or lose your hand!” he warned. Before the medic could protest, she felt a hand on her shoulder.

“Let it go,” Mal’Ava said.

“Yes, ma’am!” The medic obeyed, and together they got Zachary, as well as Anatoly, into the medical transport. Mal’Ava followed behind, as did Kolani and Prisma, and they left the training grounds.

\-

Upon waking up and taking a piss, the last thing Zachary expected to hear coming from the watch office in the middle of the night was crying. He softened his footsteps, hugging the wall and getting as close as he could, before stopping and listening in on what was going on inside. Drill Instructor Rayna was on watch tonight, the last night any of them would spend in the squadbay.

“Go away!” Rayna sobbed. “It’s not my fault! I was just following orders!” It didn’t take long to figure out what was going on. She was a veteran of the invasion of Earth. He knew Mal’Ava had some form of PTSD, but aside from her shaking occasionally in bed, or the one night terror he saw her have, he didn’t know much. Was it too much to say that Rayna had some too? No, it wasn’t, not after everything that had happened. Zachary sighed, feeling that he might regret what he’d do next.

“Drill Instructor, is everything alright?” Zachary asked, readying himself for what was about to come next. He heard the sobs subside, but continued to hear sniffling from inside the watch office. For a few seconds, he didn’t hear a response, and he thought he fucked up.

“N-no, it's not!” a muffled voice from inside replied.

“May I come in, Drill Instructor?” Zachary asked, again, not sure what he was trying to accomplish.

“Yes!” came Rayna’s soft, almost croaky voice. He stepped inside the watch office, an act that you never wanted to do in basic, and was greeted with a sight he never thought he’d see. She was sitting upright on the bed, trash bin next to her, a bottle of pills on the nightstand, and and worst of all, a loaded sidearm next to her, on the bed. Her eyes were puffy, and her cheeks were tear-streaked. That much he could tell from what little light was in the room. She looked up at him, trying her best to hold back her tears. “How do you do it?” she asked.

“Do what, Drill Instructor?” Zachary asked, staring wide eyed at the scene before him, and especially at the pistol.

“Rayna,” she told him. “Please, call me Rayna.” She scooted over on her bed, an ever-so-subtle invitation for him to sit beside her.

“Ok, Rayna,” Zachary said hesitantly, his sensibilities and experiences from his first go around at boot camp clashing hard with the here and now. He watched her hand snake down from her thigh, and lightly tap the bed. Again, alarm bells were ringing in his head at the sight in front of him. Hesitantly, slowly, he sat down on the edge of the bed, leaving a few feet of space between them. “Are you all right?” his hand slowly going for the pistol, and dragging it away from her reach.

“How do you cope with it all?” she asked, turning her head to look at him. “After everything you’ve seen, everything you’ve done? How do you handle it?” Zachary just sighed, and put his hand on her shoulder. She was going through pain he knew all too well. He knew her pain, and empathized with her.

“It's not easy, Rayna, it really isn’t,” he replied. “I’ve spent the last few years drinking myself to death to forget it all. All those I lost, how I see them in my sleep, cursing me for being alive. My family, my best friends.” He squeezed her shoulder reassuringly, trying to console her. “All gone, and they're never coming back. And it hurts so fucking bad!” he said fiercely, his own eyes starting to burn.

“I can’t stop seeing all their faces!” she whimpered out. “All those young boys I killed, and no matter how hard I try, I just can’t stop seeing them in my dreams. Blaming me, cursing me for killing them! Calling me a murderer! I didn’t want to do it, Goddess dammit! I didn’t want to fucking do it!” she said, bursting into sobs once more, her head falling into her hands.

“I’m so sorry, Rayna, I truly am. I know all too well about how you feel,” he told her, scooting closer and wrapping his arm around her. “Even now my dead friends call me a traitor for doing this. I relive old memories in my dreams that I fight so hard to keep down. But no matter how much I drank, they would keep coming back.”

“I just want it to stop! I just want to forget everything I had to do on Earth!” she sobbed out, looking Zachary in the eye, tears flowing like water from a busted dam. “Am I a murderer? Is that what you see when you look at me?” she asked, dreading the answer. “Please, tell me!” she begged. Looking up at her tear-soaked eyes, he sighed.

“I see a woman who was doing what she was ordered to do, just as me and my fellow Marines did. We both performed our duties to the best of our abilities. You're no more a murderer than I am, Rayna. What we both did in the past is over, and we can’t change it.” He reached for her hand and squeezed it reassuringly. “It takes someone else like us, someone who's been through what we’ve been through, to understand us. I had Mal’Ava to help me realize that, and I have her to thank for keeping my sorry ass alive this long. I had her to help me get through it.”

“And I have no one!” Rayna cried, her lips quivering, a fresh wave of tears flowing from her eyes. “No one understands what I’ve been through, and I’ve got no one to help me!”

“Let me help you, Rayna,” Zachary suggested. “Let me be there for you, like Mal’Ava was there for me.”

“How? After this cycle, I’m going back to the operational forces, where I’ll be even more alone than now! How can you help me when we’re so far apart?” she asked, expecting that Zachary had no answer.

“Let me talk to Mal’Ava about that,” he said confidently. “I’m sure that, one way or another, I can find a way to help you.”

“And if you can’t?”

“Well, we still have right now, and the next few days. Even if I can’t be around for long, I’ll try to make good use of my time. So why don’t we start now, and see how far we can go?” he told her. One way or another, he’d find a way to help her here, even if, and the thought of doing so stung inside, it required him having a talk with that ‘Agent Talaris’ who had followed him here. Rayna deserved some help after all she had been through, and he’d be damned if he wouldn’t do everything he could to get it for her.

\-

The day had finally arrived. The day they graduated basic training and became Imperial Marines. It was surreal for the various veterans, none more so than Zachary and Fisher. The former having gone through Basic and Scout Sniper School, while the latter went through Basic and then DI School later on. For them, this was a third graduation. Still, everyone on the Parade Grounds were all proud of their accomplishment. To them, it was the start of their new lives, reaching a long sought-after goal, and they'd all made it. Then the Commanding General began her speech to the newly graduated Marines, and her words hit many of the Humans *hard!*

“Today, you join the bulwark of our forces against those who seek to stand against the great Shil’vati Imperium. You shall bring the light of the Imperium and our Empress to new worlds, and make our destiny manifest before all we see!”

*Manifest Destiny.* The words sounded odd coming from an alien, and absolutely surreal to the Americans present. To say it was a controversial point in their own history was putting it lightly. Now, they would become a tool in the arsenal of an expansionist Empire, who believed it had a divine right to conquer all it surveyed. Or at least, those weak enough for the Imperial Military to roll over. The Alliance and Consortium still stood, so that was saying something.

“Manifest fucking Destiny!” Zachary muttered, shaking his head ever so slightly. Anatoly and William both nodded in agreement.

“Yeah, brings back unpleasant memories of the old days. Days that we’re destined to repeat.” William said uneasily.

The rest of her speech was drowned out in the minds of the Humans, as they all had their own thoughts to listen to. Then the formations pivoted, and began marching across the Parade Grounds, the families of the graduates clapping and cheering wildly as they did. For the Humans, seeing actual Shil’vati family units was odd. So few men, so many women, and what counted as children for the Shil’vati. They saw a total of three Humans in the crowd, a woman and two children. They were Siva’s family, who he had requested to be here for graduation.

Before long their minds were back on the formation and how they were called to halt before the podium, once more facing the General, the various Senior Drill Instructors, and their Drill Instructors. The General stepped back and walked away, allowing for the Shil’vati equivalent of a Chief Drill Instructor to march up and take her place.

“I will now begin reading off your future postings, where the next phase of your training shall begin.” And that she did, one by one, for the nearly 200 new Marines on the Parade Grounds. “Acting-Private Kadra Mithis. Survey Corps, communications, Periphery Prime Base.” While Zachary couldn’t see his face, he knew Kadra had a beaming smile written across it. He wanted to explore, and that’s what the Survey Corps did.

“Acting-Private Trissila Trenis, Logistical Corps.” The naming went on and on for all the recruits. The twins, Dexta and Dax’Ala, got separated, one for shuttle flying, another working as a shuttle repair crewwoman. Revani was given a designation of Advanced Reconnaissance Infantry, something they didn’t know anything about, but would soon learn. More and more names were listed, and it wasn’t until the first Human was called that Zachary paid attention.

“Acting-Private Anatoly Novikov, Exo Corps, Classified. Acting-Private Adam Fisher, Exo Corps, Classified.” Everyone’s ears perked up upon hearing the word ""classified"" after their names.

“What the fuck?” Zachary and William whispered simultaneously.

“At least I’ll get to have some more fun with those Exos!” Anatoly said humorlessly, squinting his eyes up at the CDI at the podium. “But why is Fisher being selected? I thought he was a Drill Instructor in the American Marines?” the Russian asked.

“He was,” Zachary began. “But before he was a DI, he worked on tanks and shit with the 1st Tank Battalion.”

“Maybe they think he’ll be good with repairing Exos or something,” William said, shrugging. The naming for the Humans continued, listing off the same vocations for the four civilians on the Parade Grounds.

“Acting-Privates Victor Stone, Johan Nilsson, Pierre Fournier, and Nikau, Infantry Training, Shil Training Base 1.” The news made the four young men in the formation of Marines stiffen in shock. The four youngest, most obviously civilian Humans, were heading straight to the Shil’vati capital world, as well as a certain two Rakiri. Although they probably still saw the vets as a security risk, so them going there was a nonstarter in all probability. They were also the ones who wouldn’t have as much of a grudge against the Shil’vati as the veterans did.

Johan was relatively unbiased and the most friendly to the Shil, but he didn’t care much for their advances. Pierre’s father was aboard the *Charles De Gaulle* when the Shil’vati invaded. Combine that with the attempted rape, and he was more than a bit standoffish with Shil. Nikau was Maori from New Zealand, and his ancestry alone didn’t have him hold imperialistic powers in high regard. Victor didn’t have anything against them either. Worst he saw was his local Marine recruiter being dragged out dead after said Marine shoved a K-Bar through a Purp's throat.

“Acting-Private Zachary O’Connor.” As the CDI went on, every last Human from cadres 1-5 was called out before she finally named their vocation. “Advanced Reconnaissance Infantry Training, Periphery Prime Base.” The woman paused, looking at the Humans, then back at the list, to them, and back at the pad in her hand. Even some of the other DI’s seemed confused and surprised, and the murmuring from the crowd meant the same was for them too.

“The fuck is Advanced Reconnaissance Infantry?” Anatoly asked.

“I think it's similar to what me and William were back in the day,” Zachary said.

“So like the good old days, becoming grunts again,” William said.

“Eh, better than being a pog. You telling me you didn’t sign up as infantry at the top of your preferences?”

“I’m not saying that, but it's kinda funny in a way. Six years of not doing that shit anymore, and we’re going right back into the shit.” Not wanting to attract attention from any of the hawk-eyed DI’s, they decided to shut up as the Lead Drill Instructor finished her speech to the new Marines.

“Starting now, you have four days of leave to spend with family and friends. At the start of the new week, every Marine is to be present and accounted for at dawn. Do not be late,” she warned, looking them over one last time. “You are dismissed!”

With those words said, the formation broke apart. Everyone broke into cheers of celebration and sought out their friends and family. All the various Human veterans gathered together, hugging and fist bumping wildly, celebrating their latest accomplishment and getting ready for the wild next few days. As Victor joined his girlfriend and her friend, the girlfriends of Elias and Adam rushed over, embracing each other on the Parade Grounds, eliciting smiles from all of their nearby comrades.

“Father!” came two voices from nearby. Siva’s children ran over to him, and Siva bent down, and picked them up into a big hug.

“Sanani, Devance, I’ve missed you so much!” Siva said, scooping his two young boys into a tight hug, tears streaming down his face. The sight of Siva and his family made many of those present tear up, especially for those who lost family, and didn’t have any left. It was a very welcome and heartwarming sight indeed. Looking up from his children, he saw his wife approaching him. “Binsa!” He exclaimed, lowering his boys gently onto the ground, before rushing to her and pulling her into an embrace.

“Siva, my darling!” Binsa said, as her lips met with those of her husband.

“At least someone has family to come and see them,” Zachary remarked sadly, the thoughts of him graduating boot camp all those years ago coming to the forefront of his mind. Back then, they were there for him to watch him accomplish his goal. Now, the only one he had was his girlfriend in the crowd to watch him. It felt odd, no doubt, but he was thankful he had someone there for him in the end. Before he could dwell too deeply on it, he felt a tug on his arm. Turning around, he noticed Kadra standing right next to him, a nervous expression on his face.

“Uh, c-can you please come with me? Or are you still mad at me?” Kadra asked, a look of worry in his expression as he looked up at the tall Marine. Zachary couldn’t help but smile down at Kadra. He was still a bit peeved about the whole incident, but luckily, as far as they knew, they had wiped the video from the site Kadra had uploaded it on. Then he remembered why Kadra wanted him to join him, and his smile faltered. His family was here. His pathetic excuse for a mother was here.

“Don’t worry, Kadra, I’m not mad at you anymore, and I won’t let anything happen to you,” he said reassuringly, putting his hand on his arm. He felt Kadra relax as his hand rested on the smaller male. He looked back at his other fellow veterans, all joyous over their recent accomplishment, and ready to celebrate. William looked over at him, and he nodded, signalling him to alert the others of what was about to happen. Kadra’s backstory and family history was known to both the Humans, and a number of the girls in the cadres.

“Don’t worry, kid. If she tries anything, we’ll put a stop to it,” Alistair said reassuringly.

“There’s nothing wrong with who you are, kid,” William added. “If they can’t accept you because of it, fuck them!”

“Thank you!” Kadra replied softly, looking at the assortment of new Marines all standing there to back him up, and his boyfriend, right at his side.

“We’re all here for you,” Zachary said, gesturing his hand to both the Marines behind him, as well as to the Drill Instructors up at the podium. Zachary had told Rayna about the situation with Kadra, and how there might be trouble with his family on graduation. Judging by the looks on the faces of quite a few of them, they weren’t exactly happy laying eyes on Kadra’s incubator. Boy bashers were already looked down heavily by most Shil’vati, Helkam, Rakiri, Nighkru, and just about every other species. Rapists though? They had a death wish if they stepped in the wrong place, and their deeds were known.

“Thank you!” Kadra said once more, stepping forward, and wrapping his arms around Zachary in a tight hug, and the Human reciprocated very quickly.

“You forget about me, little brother?” Asked a very familiar voice from behind. Kadra’s eyes widened as he let loose from his boyfriend, and looked behind him. His big sister, Karela, was standing but a few feet away from him, a proud smile written on her features as she looked down at her brother.

“Karela!” Kadra said excitedly, quickly unwrapping his arms from Zachary, and lunging at his sister. Karela bent down slightly and wrapped him up in a tight hug, and he happily responded with one of his own. “I’ve missed you so much, Karela! You’ve been gone too long! I wish you were around more often!” he said, a slight sadness in his voice. She knew full well what he meant.

“I’m sorry I left you alone Kadra, but staying wasn’t an option for me, just like it wasn’t for you,” she said to him, pulling him in tighter. “But I’m here for you now, and I won’t let anything happen to you,” she assured him, gently rubbing her arm up and down his back. She pulled off of him, smiling as she looked down at him, and then to Zachary. “So who's your new friend?” she asked, raising an eyebrow as she gave him a once over.

“Karela, this is my boyfriend, Zachary O’Connor!” Kadra said sheepishly, a blush creeping up on his face as he introduced the two of them, unaware that they had already met in some capacity before. “Zachary, this is my big sister, Karela.” The two of them stared at each other for a moment, before the realization set in that they both met.

“Weren’t you the one that I saw at the bar back on Earth? The one involved with Major Mal’Ava?” she asked, cocking her head slightly.

“Yep, that’s me. And I assume you're the one who protected Kadra here from the others?” Zachary asked, Karela’s eyes widening slightly. “He told me about what happened, about the family,” he said, before closing the distance and hugging the Shil’vati Corporal, an act that made the woman blush hard.

“I, uh,” she stammered out, looking over to Kadra, who was smiling up at her.

“You're a good woman, Karela, and an even better sister, for standing up for him all those years ago, even when being beaten down for it yourself,” he told her, before breaking off from the hug.

“I’m sorry I couldn’t have helped you more, Kadra,” she said, looking down at her little brother, whose attention was fixated on a group coming towards them.

“Zachary,” Kadra said softly, slinking his hand to Zachary’s, and gripping it tightly.

“I’m here for you Kadra. We all are!” Zachary said firmly, as he ran his eyes over the group. When it came down to most of them, nothing was out of the ordinary. One male, a few small children, and a group of females, some of which were older siblings. However, tracking Kadra’s eyes, he found out who his incubator was. She was average height, with a noticeable gut, and wildly unkempt hair. She strutted over to the group as if she was the hottest shit on the planet. She really did look like the Shil’vati equivalent of a redneck, and it was bothersome.

“Thank you!” He said once more, his grip getting ever so tighter as she made her way up to them. Then she spoke in her disgusting voice, an equally disgusting smile on her face.

“My baby boy, Kadra, how good it is to see you again after all these months! And I see your big sister, Karela, has joined us here as well! What a pleasant surprise!” She said loudly, not caring of bothering those nearby.

“That’s not the word I’d use.” Karela muttered just loud enough for Zachary to hear.

“And who are all these Humans here?” She asked, oblivious to the fact that every Human present, as well as most of those around, had very unfriendly expressions written across their faces as they stared at the woman. “And who is this hot little guy, next to you?” She ran her tongue across her lips as she directed that question. It took every ounce of will he had not to shudder in response as the sight in front of him. However her smile soon turned into a frown as she noticed where his hand was placed. “And why are you holding his hand?”

The shift in her tone was noticeable, as were the expressions on the rest of Kadra’s family, which didn’t go unnoticed. Out of the corner of his eye, Zachary could see a group of DI’s, led by Prisma and Rayna, watching intensely. He also saw Agent Talaris, flanked by three other Interior agents. The glares that they had focused on Kadra’s family sent a chill up his spine.

“Mom, dad,” Kadra began nervously, almost flinching when his mother’s gaze turned hostile towards him. “This is my boyfriend, Zachary O’Connor, and I love him!” He said, straightening his posture, and trying his best to not be cowed by the woman in front of him.

“What did you just say?” His mother growled, scowling down at her son with an intense fury in her eyes. The rest of the family went wide-eyed in shock at Kadra’s admission of love for the Human male. His father’s mouth went agape, his hand shooting over to cover it.

“This is who I am, mom! I can’t and won’t change that, no matter how much you all beat and raped me for who I am!” He stated, clenching his fists, as tears streamed down his eyes at the thought of what they once did. His mother balled her fists in anger, as did some of the other step mothers, only to notice the increasing number of Marines surrounding them, with very pissed off expressions.

“Clearly we didn’t fix you when we had the chance,” She snarled, only to be interrupted by Karela soon after.

“YOU RAPED HIM!” Karela screamed, attracting even more stares from those around.

“He was broken!” She turned to glare at Zachary, who returned the stare. “But it seems these barbarians undid all that we did to fix him!”

“I WAS NEVER BROKEN!” Kadra screamed, tears streaming down his face even faster as his nails dug into his palms, dripping purple blood down on the ground.

“YOU WERE ALWAYS A DISGRACE OF A SON!” She screamed, balling her right hand up, and cocking her arm back. Kadra’s eyes went as wide as dinner plates at the familiar sight, and he brought his arms up to defend himself. In an instant, Zachary’s hand gripped the lithe male by the midsection, and he hurriedly swung Kadra out of the way. The overweight Shil got off balance, and became an easy target.

“Too fucking easy, bitch!” Zachary growled, maneuvering around the woman and slamming a boot into the back of her knee, sending her tumbling to the floor. She hit the ground hard, knocking the wind out of her, and giving Zachary just enough time to spin on his heel, and connect his boot to her jaw. Her head slammed onto the concrete with a satisfying thud. Looking up, he saw that all hell had broken loose. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a purple blue shape dart toward him, only for another to slam into that one, and send it crashing to the ground.

“YOU WILL NOT HARM MY MARINES!” SDI Prisma bellowed, as other DI's rushed in, along with Talaris and her squad, and took down those looking to fight. Karela had one of her sisters pinned to the ground, and her hands around the woman’s neck. Looking behind him, however, he saw Kadra huddled on the ground, crying. Zachary wasted no time rushing over to him.

“It’s ok, Kadra, they can’t hurt you anymore!” Zachary said softly, scooping the Shil’vati up in his arms, his head diving into Zachary’s chest as he began to violently sob.

“They always hurt me! Why don’t they love me?” Kadra cried. While Zachary was thankful to have had a family that accepted him, not all those like him were as lucky.

———-

Artemis spat out a globule of blood and looks up at the smaller ISS agent. “Now why is that necessary? Punchin lil ol me.” She grins showing red all over her teeth. Her dark red hair done up in a fraying braid.

That giant of an alien redhead woman sitting naked tied and chained to a chair. hasn’t been giving agent Badenvi Chugnis anything useful other than her name and that she’s a human. A very irritating and augmented human.

Fucking hell that hurts her knuckles just punching her in that pretty face. This lady was practically caught on her own taking a piss out in the middle of a war zone. It was like she was asking to be captured. But all she was able to get out of her is laughter and saying irrelevant shit in that irritating accent of hers.

“LISTEN HERE I WILL MAKE YOU TALK AND ILL MAKE YOU CRY LIKE A LITTLE STIFF BOY!” She immediately walks and grabs a blow torch. And grins. “You know what?”

“What? Is it that your a sixteen piece chicken mcnobody.” She chuckled.

Well agent Chugnis isn’t some artificial sadist. No those people have their brains altered to not feel anything when they torture political prisoners. But her. No. She’s a natural born who takes an almost sexual pleasure in making people scream in more ways than a sane person can imagine. 

But this bitch never once screamed when she hit her with a zonfer prod at max power. In fact, she just laughs and mocks her womanhood. Fuck she has injected pain inducing chemicals. Turns out. She has an auto-pharmacological unit. Then she said “is that the best you can do?”.

Maybe she’ll burn that human’s tits off. That would ruin her chances with any man. And ruin her emotionally like the many other women who had the tits to laugh at her methods. Maybe her clitoris too.

“Those overgrown udders of yours would look like they’re in need of a reduction.” She grins looking at Artemis’s bare chest. The torch was immediately flipped on. 

“Fuuuuuck me.” Artemis wistles. “You must be really overcompensating for your pair of teeeny tiny tits.”

Now Agent Chugnis does have a small pair and often stuffs her bra. But nobody EVER calls her tits tiny and gets out unscathed. And That pissed off agent Chugnis. All she wants her to do is scream and beg for her to end the pain like the others. No this is a challenge.

“Didn’t your daddy ever tell you to watch your tongue around us ISS agents.” She said ignoring the fact that she is from an alien culture.

“No, but at least my mom stuck around and taught me correctly unlike that missing whore daddy of yours.”

Agent Chugnis froze. How did she know this?

“Damn. It looks like I’m right.” She giggles.

“THATS IT!” She storms straight towards Artemis from her torture Arsenal. “MAYBE I SHOULD START WITH THAT FACE!”

“Kinky.” Is all she said.

She still has that shit eating grin plastered all over her tanned face. Let’s adjust it. Let’s remove her left eye.

CRACK! Agent Chugnis fell over her leading left leg. Which is bending in the wrong direction at the knee. She shrieks as she fell over.

Her pitch black servitor decorated up to look like a skeleton holding a pipe.

“Well I could’ve walked out about an hour ago.” She said over the agents screams and choking sobs.

She began to look up with tear streaked eyes as the chains and ropes holding that bitch down began to undo and slide off of her toned, heavily muscled nude body.

“Buuuuut I think I should have some fun while I’m at it.” She said with glee.

Agent Chugnis just trying to crawl away in fear.

Artemis immediately with a bare foot stomped her left arm breaking it getting a scream out of Chugnis. Then she reached down and grabbed her good right arm and lifted her up to Artemis,s eye level.

“Oh the irony.” She said with a knowing grin. “You seem to be this all tough and scary bitch and look at you now. A broken sobbing mess.”

“WH-SOB- DO-Sob YOU WANT!” Agent Chugnis chokes out.

Artemis grin widens. “Oh, let’s learn more about you.” She lifts her free hand and black and silver cables extends from.

Agent Chugnis’s eyes widens in horror.

“Oh this?” Artemis gloats. “I have a good majority of your ISS codes that I have taken from The late CEO Satok.” She leans in closer. “Did you know like you she is a piece of shit?” Her expression changed to something of distaste and hatred. “who maintains her immortality by taking her own daughter’s bodies.”

Late? Why is she relevant?

“But I’m short on time to liberate the prisoners and your not going to live that long.” She grins.

The servitor grabs hold of agent Chugnis and unceremonious pins her face first into the ground. Holding her good arm down.

“ST-AHP! PLEASE!” She sobbed. Snot rolling out of her nose.

“Now normally I would take your clothes too. Buuuut yours is a tad bit too small and tight around the chest area.” She then paused for thought brushing a loose red strand from her eye.

“Well knowing that human men would find you attractive, and the more weaboos would find that harems are a thing. And they like all tits your tiny ones included. You might’ve had a chance.” She took a sadistic grin. “Maybe you could’ve gotten yourself a masochist boyfriend. But, since your an infamous interrogator who takes a sadistic glee in such things.” She leaves it at that.

Agent Chugnis tries and tries to contact for help.

[signal blocked.]

“I also forgot to mention that I have blocked all communications from this room.” She places a knee on her broken arm getting a shriek. “Plus this room is soundproofed so no amount of screaming is going to save you.”

“St-“ Agent Chugnis got out. When she felt a cold spread int through her neck and her limbs deadened.

“Now I had just injected paralytics so you can’t move those pesky limbs of yours.” She applied more pressure on the agent’s broken arm and agent Chugnis wanted to scream. 

But all she got out was a loud sigh as rivulets of tears rolled down her face.

“Now now.” 

[administrator entered.]

Agent Chugnis’s eyes widens and tries to push the the presence out of her head. But it’s like fighting a tsunami with a plastic fork.

Her body lit up as if she was submerged in liquid iron she tries to shriek. Throwing her thoughts off.

“Now now. No need to make this any harder.” Artemis said. “You seem to really get off inflicting pain on others but when it happens to you, weeeellllll, you seem to cower.” 

A memory flashes of her torturing a man in front of his wives to get them to admit that they are insurgents. Then raping and killing him. And many many other similar ones. Then another involving her burning their faces and various body parts. And more gruesome methods. She is seeing them all and the agent is powerless to resist.

“Yep you really enjoy the power involved over your victims.” She can sense her feral grin. “But this time let’s take that power away and see how you like it.”

———-

Artemis walks out of the room buck ass naked because that sadistic shithead burned her cloths right in front of her. So it’s only fair that she gets strung up in a body bag alive and be used like a punching bag for her two servitors. With metal sticks.

She considered the agent’s plans for burning off her tits and clit. Apparently doing so in this culture would be like castration for humans. The loss of the ability to pleasure themselves and breast feed a baby. Would be a major blow to any woman’s self esteem because of the visibility and very humiliating if tossed out on the street.

But Artemis decided to play with the fatherless bitch and any damage would be easily fixed with her biotech and nanotech. But the tits part would be harder to hide and explain away for a while. Or until they grow back. Luckily for her, she didn’t burn Artemis’s tits off. And her inevitable death would be far more painful if she did. 

The only signs of her interrogation would be some stopped bleeding in her cheek and marks on her body where ropes and chains were used. They would be healed in a matter of hours.

Oh well. She would also need to find some cloths.

She took some of that agent’s knives from her torture supply and tossed them into the bag she had on her head. Fucking hell.

She also took the Liberty to remove some gold braids from the agent’s uniform to improvise a handle.

Time to use those special ISS codes to render herself invisible to all base personnel. Judging from the base regulations the soldiers are required to wear their helmets at all times. So the codes are meant to render any agent using them invisible. So Artemis will use it hide her 3 meter nude body. 

Now let’s grab something to use as a weapon because apparently the dumbass has a slug thrower with no bullets. She really loves to mentally torture too apparently. Well that wouldn’t work on Artemis knowing her titanium graphene skull would easily protect her important bits.

She grins as she walks past some fully suited soldiers broadcasting codes. Rendering the armed giant exhibitionist walking past them invisible to their helmets. The helmets have a VR style of set up that when an ISS code is entered the software within said helmet would digitally erase said broadcasting agent.

So now Artemis can walk around the prison complex with impunity. Provided that the other agents aren’t watching and the soldiers have their helmets on.

From the implant data she acquired from the agent it’s quite common for them to take the side arms and ammo of non ISS personnel. Generally they’re too afraid to protest and would pretend not to notice. So Artemis liberated of two dart pistols. Buuuut she doesn’t have anywhere to store them because the knives filled the bag up. Definitely not her coochie and definitely not her ass. She would have to steal herself a much larger bag.

Then again, her lower colon area as well as her Coochi is reinforced with Kevlar. Why would those engineers make it that strong? Is it for when she does anal? Well Artemis had to do that many times for United American marines, and generic, and oral, and practically everything else a marine would need. Maybe smuggling like how prisoners would dub “the prison wallet” and her cooch “the prison purse”. She shakes her head at the thought. No she won’t stick anything up there for transport. She has standards. 

She sticks one gun and liberated ammo into her bag turned improvised purse. She held the other one out after ripping off the trigger guard.

Artemis immediately walks down the corridor.

She notes the cell doors and that they are each a solid white. This is the Isolation block. So one of these rooms is for her. Though the torture chamber could’ve turned into one knowing that sadist. She would devise many methods of keeping her victims awake whenever she’s out.

She walks through the hallways taking the occasional random item from the soldiers. Like. Why would they even need smoke grenades?

There’s an unoccupied room. She pings the lock and the door opened. She entered. The only thing in this white tiled room is a hole in the ground, a pillow and a blanket. 

She wraps the white blanket around her chest like a towel. Then she took the pillow and removes the case and tore it into a long strip and ties it around her waist pinning the blanket down.

Artemis notes with a grimace that the improvised dress stretched about an inch and a half below her crotch and ass. So she’s going to be careful to avoid flashing people. Then again, the fabric is weak and prone to tearing. Likely to prevent suicide.

She then shoulders her bag and immediately walks out the door. The guards not noticing the door open and close.

She entered a secure double door area. One door reads ISS prison command. And the other is general population.

She sent a signal and the door opened. 

——-

“And that is how I accidentally saw that fucked in the head Badenvi the cunt’s tiny tits and lived.” Agent Lodecsa Yarusuc said. “Better than that time when a greenie was made to watch videos of fucked in the head torturing her various victims.” Lodecsa grimaced. “She had those alterations done and yet she is still disturbed.”

A code was sent in. Well Fuck.

“It looks like the crazy bitch is back.” She looks back from her console. “Don’t make eye contact.”

They hear footfalls.

“So agent Chugnis, what did you get?”

“That she found out that my dad is a whore and that I have baby tits.” She replied.

“I’m so-“

———

The First Lady’s head exploded. Artemis duel wielding dart pistols head shoting all six of the agents so as to not trigger their alarm.

She walked into another room and shot two more agents seemingly taking turns at having sex with a grey skinned male prisoner.

He screamed like a little girl. Then stares showing his canines open mouthed at the shooter.

“Im here to free the prisoners so I suggest you be quiet.” Artemis said quietly.

He nodded quickly and slid on his neon green jumpsuit over his partially nude body. She tossed him a knife where it clattered on the floor. He scrambled to take it. 

“Wait.” He said with a trembling voice. Looking up with frightened purple eyes. Holding the knife up.

“Make it quick.” Artemis said moving on to the next room opened the door and headshots an officer.

He winced. “Are you that Arta-miss lady people in the prison speak of?” He spoke nervously at the fact that now there’s a partially nude tan red headed giantess with an alien accent in the room. He seemed to expect that she would want sex. Well she’s not interested. 

“Yes I am Artemis.” She drawls out. As she systemically opens doors and shoots ISS agents and moves on. “And no, I am not here to have sex with you.” 

He seemed to deflate. 

“That bitch interrogator Chugnis burned the cloths I was wearing this morning right in front of me.”

Shit all out of darts. She tossed a knife into the head of an agent. Then drops both magazines and reloads them both.

“I deliberately got caught. Buuuuu-” Artemis trails off as she blown the brains out of another agent. “-uuuuut I was inconveniently taking a piss.” Despite all of her various recycling systems, a hunter class needs to perform basic waste disposal of anything non recyclable.

“Oh.” He said. Then winced as Artemis grabbed an agent by her head and twisted creating a sickening wet crack.

Artemis sent a lockdown signal to all doors leading in and out of the fortified ISS control room.

Now Artemis and that man entered the primary control room. She sets her pistols and bag down grinning like the liberator she is and immediately got to work.

60,pdkc3s,HFY,Sun Aug 29 02:30:38 2021,"Janeway wasn't my aim, but she just might have been the inspiration for... The Andromeda Paradox--part 2","**Part 1 [***here***](https://www.reddit.com/user/ill_B_In_MyBunk/) so you can see it!**


“What’s our status?” a woman’s commanding voice called.

“Green lights across the board, Captain. We’re at 95% output from reactor one. Transferring flow to orbital gate—now.”

Captain Samantha Butler stood at the forefront of the arrowhead-shaped bridge of the Andromeda. At forty-two, some questioned her experience in command of such a large vessel. Piercing walnut-colored eyes searched the horizon for some sign of threat. She was a military officer turned civilian. Her departure from the service was viewed by those same detractors as proof of her unsuitability. She chose to leave the command of the same battleships that lay in orbit defending Andromeda. 

“No one is doubting her ability,” the interview from Centurion broadcasting played over in her head, “but why would the UNSM’s youngest female general leave command after just one year? Is that the type of person that can really be trusted to guide humanity’s future?” 

Samantha closed her eyes hard to dispel the vision of the program from her head. 

“Good,” she mumbled at first. 

“Excellent,” she announced. 

“Should I hail General Getty, ma’am,” the communications officer’s deep voice called from behind the captain’s position.

“In a moment, Mr. Scott,” she returned playfully without turning to face the man with the baritone voice. “Let me bask in this view just a moment longer before I need to report to the suits. Ms. Reed, are all the shuttles back in the aft hangar?”

“Yes, ma’am,” the small woman’s soprano voice answered. “Lockdown was finalized just before reactor spin-up. All aboard who’s coming aboard.”

“Ms. Reed?” Captain Butler turned to face the cargo manager with a raised eyebrow. 

“Oh, I was trying to make it sound more—nautical, general.”

Captain Butler nodded and let out a sigh.

“Of course, Ms. Reed,” she agreed, moving back to the commander’s chair at the center of the bridge. The throne raised slightly as she approached. Samantha Butler scaled two raised circular platforms that acted as steps to the gyroscopically stabilized captain’s chair. Butler hardly thought it necessary in a civilian vessel, but she appreciated the safety measure, nonetheless. Hopefully there’d be no reason to make hasty maneuvers at all on their brief skip across the galaxy. 

“Alright! Now, I guess we'd better call big brother before he starts to worry,” Captain Butler called as she sat down and faced a small pane of glass to her right. 

“Transferring General Getty to your line now, Captain.”

Captain Butler placed a small receiver into her ear in preparation for the conversation with General Getty. She took a breath before asking for the call to be transferred to her. Go ahead, she mouthed to the dark-skinned Jacob Scott. The small glass to her right lit up and the picture of an aged man showed before her with numerous bars across his shoulder and three bright shining silver stars. Her old boss greeted her with a warm smile. 

“General Butler how are you?” his raspy seasoned voice asked in her ear.

“Fleet Admiral Getty it is a pleasure as always,” Butler answered. “It’s Captain Butler now, though. I keep reminding myself that this is a civilian vessel and calling myself general would only do to revive the old mindset.”

“You can call yourself captain all you like, General, but you earned that title deservedly. I’ll respect your wishes in public but will continue to call you that as old generals catching up.”

“Old generals,” she stressed. “Speak for yourself, sir.” 

“Samantha, you give me lip like that and I’ll have you court martialed!” 

“That’s why I quit your service, sir; the mouth was always getting me in trouble,” she grinned.

“Don’t take this the wrong way, General, but you’re the most sarcastic son-of-a-bitch I ever let serve under me.” He paused a moment and the wide smile narrowed slightly, “Why’d you ever leave?”

His saddened tone broke her stony exterior only momentarily. She was his protege. His reference was instrumental in her being hired as captain of the Andromeda. He held no ill-will, but she always hated that she couldn’t tell him why she had chosen to part with her duties in the armed forces. 

“I—uh,” she wished so much to say it wasn’t his fault. She wanted to tell him that it had nothing to do with the closeness of their relationship. She was devastated by the rumors of his over-friendliness. Captain Butler was sure he’d never make that mistake again. “Let’s talk more about that when I’m back in the solar system, yes? I don’t plan to stay in Kepler long, maybe a few months. After that, let’s plan a chat and catch up as old friends.”

“Of course,” Getty nodded, pretending to forget his sadness. “I’ll hold you to that, Captain. Now, back to business. I see your preflight checks all look good. Power levels are excellent. Ship is secure. How long are you estimating until the all-clear?” 

“Two hours, sir. I think I’ll order up some dinner to my chambers and watch the checkboxes tick off. I have a feeling that after we make the jump, I won’t be relaxing for a while.”
“I hate the thought of you going out there with no escort but the damn command module. It burns me that President Keller wouldn’t outfit one of our battleships with the same jump drive so we could—”

“Take an additional and unnecessary risk,” Captain Butler finished. “This manned jump is the first test of over 100 people at a time. If it goes well, then let’s discuss bringing Earth's military might across the galaxy to a planet devoid of intelligent life. The odds are very good your crew would sit useless for months while we unloaded equipment.”

“We could have carried boxes, General. Give us some credit,” he chuckled lightly. “No, I suppose you’re right. A thousand bored soldiers would have meant 500 fatherless bastards when they left.”

“I don’t know,” Butler grinned. “The colonists probably could have used the genetic diversity.”

“Always thinking ahead, Captain,” Getty shook his head. “Now do this for me. Put me on the overhead, and I’ll make your crew feel special.”

“Oh, I wouldn’t miss a Getty rally for the world, sir.”

She went to remove the earpiece, but was stopped by a sudden exclamation of wait, one more thing from the buzzing earbud as she moved it from her face. She stuffed it back into her ear momentarily. 

“Be careful out there. It’s just gonna be you and yours. There’s no contacting Earth. There’ll be no leaving until your next scheduled jump. Your successes, and mistakes, will resonate within your crew. But then again, your decision making has always been stellar. It’s why I trusted you with a command in the first place.”

“Thank you, sir. I learned from the best. We’ll be cautious. Take care of yourself.”

The general gave a wave as she removed him from her personal line and plugged him back into the main channel. As his face projected onto the airspace in front of Samantha’s chair, he addressed the bridge. 

“Crew and citizens of the Andromeda, this is Fleet Admiral Jim Getty. I want to talk to you all about the mission you are undertaking. Your ship is going to make a jump across the galaxy into foreign and unfamiliar space with no discernable time frame of return. This is not an edict for your average person. You all were chosen because the Andromeda is far from typical. Each hand-picked crewmember was vetted by the impressively accomplished Captain Samantha Butler. She was an asset to this man's Air Force for thirteen years. She will be invaluable to your success and instrumental in every decision you make from here on out.”

A small smile slid across Samantha Butler's face.

“Choose not to be afraid of the future. Instead, approach every moment of your journey with the same steadfast resolve that the first American settlers had as they journeyed westward in search of a new life. Take stock in this certainty:  you are humanity's last and best hope for a new future.”

Even Ms. Reed seemed to nod along in agreement, as though she were a part of something bigger.

“You will undoubtedly face trials. Accept and tackle them as a cohesive unit, or try as individuals to undertake their challenge, and fail. This is no time for questioning and dissention, but instead, unity. I have faith that under Captain Butler's leadership, this new cornerstone of humanity shall not only survive, but thrive. Good luck, and Godspeed.”


Toward the center of the ship, the entirety of PJ's diner was silent. As the public announcement system chirped off, the patrons looked around at each other in befuddlement. While they knew of the risks and understood that there was to be no jumping back until Earth re-opened the tear, the facts laid bare before them stood in stark contrast to the jubilation that was previously spreading like a plague among the eager settlers. A free ride from poverty into the promise of a shining utopia. This promised land was already constructed, fee free, for those brave enough to make that first jump. The PR event was sold out moments after registration opened. Out of over three million entries in six minutes, only six-thousand residents were chosen to be included in the initial settlement. Their 100,000-credit fee was waived under the promise that they would reside on Canaan Prime for a minimum of seven years. If they left early, they would have the balance of their trip due upon arrival back to Earth. This was not an option for the James family. 

Nate James, a father of two, sat beside his beautiful wife Mary. Across from the couple, two pairs of children’s eyes looked unprepared for the message they had just received. 

“What did he mean, unfamiliar space?” Lucy James asked. She was fifteen years old and wise beyond her years. Unlike her younger brother, she seemed to grasp the spirit of the message from General Getty completely. She resumed, twirling a breadstick about in the air as though it were an extension of her uncertainty. “Like—no one knows what is out there?”

“Well, honey,” Mary began, nervously glancing to her husband as she tried to reassure Lucy, the girl with coffee-colored hair whose mannerisms were twitchy enough to match, “In reading about Kepler 20, it seems like they’ve mapped out all the star movements, but no—there hasn’t been excessive exploration in the sector due to the cost of trips. It’s perfectly safe, though. Humanity is the only intelligent life in the universe.”

“Only intelligent life,” Robert James caught. Although his vocabulary was mildly less than Lucy’s, he was extremely advanced for his age. The ten-year-old was analytical, although often less than socially adept. “So, they’ve researched every—single—plant and animal on Canaan? They’ve dived to the bottom of every ocean? They’ve searched every inch of jungle and desert?”

“Robbie,” his father blurted out in a low voice. “That’s enough.” 

“No, Robbie is right!"" Lucy blurted. ""They should have gone into more depth with their evaluation of the planet. It seems great, but what if—”

“Our home in Miami had been swept over by storm-surge from one of the dozen hurricanes we weather every year?” Mary James interrupted. “What if our tiny amount of savings was exhausted because we had a sudden medical bill and we starved? What if a colossal earthquake cracked the Floridian peninsula from the mainland and we drifted off to sea and sunk under its depths? Sweetheart, there’s no point in playing the ‘what-if’ game.”

“Mom, I wasn’t trying to be sarcas—”

Lucy turned up her hands plaintively but was cut off by her mother.

“But you were; and we are here!” Mary thundered, as she began lifting her fingers one at a time to illustrate her upcoming points. “Our living-space is rent free. Our food is provided. Our family has some semblance of security, and if it happens to be in a different arm of the galaxy, then so be it. This is a chance for us to start over!” 

Mary’s traditional optimism was lost on Nathaniel. He knew his kids were right. Then again, so was his wife. Perspective had a lot to do with how the situation was to be perceived. He supposed that if there was a position to take, it should be a visionary one.

“Your mother is right. We've boarded the ship. We've accepted passage. There's no turning back. So, our best bet is to approach this with courage and be the absolute finest we can be,” Nathaniel finished. 

“Attention residents and staff, this is your captain speaking. We have completed all pre-flight checks and are prepared to begin the process toward opening the portal. We are approximately one hour and forty-five minutes away from liftoff. Please head back to your transport chambers and begin securing cargo for the jump. All residents are required to be in their transport pods a half-hour before we travel to the Kepler system. At this time, all media events are wrapping up and all personnel should report to their duty stations. Thank you for your cooperation, and I’ll be back in about an hour and a half for the pre-flight countdown.”

“All right, you heard the lady. Let’s get going!"" Nate announced. ""We need to take the tram, and I’m sure it’s going to be slammed in about two minutes."" 

Mary leaned into her husband’s chest and placed a palm over his bicep as she thought of their future together, and the surprise Nate held for their youngest.

“You gonna tell him?” Mary smiled, leaning in close to her husband. 

He nodded and waited for the children to stand from their booth. Modeled after the traditional diners from Earth’s heyday, PJ’s was one stop down the line from the observation deck on the top level of the ship. Chrome and hints of patent red leather were common throughout the white-tiled establishment. 

Designed to seat just a couple-hundred guests at a time, this restaurant was one of the many aboard Andromeda and would remain in use even after arrival on New Canaan until the colony was fully established. Nathaniel emerged from the black-leather booth last and flattened out his modest clothing that he’d pressed to fit in with the higher-class individuals aboard Andromeda. The ship was a dream-come-true for his family who lived paycheck to paycheck. They were just above the indentured servants, and that elevation was tenuous at best. The chance to be “one of the crowd” was enticing. He had begun working out again in preparation for the trip because he knew a chunky merc was sure to be an unemployed one. Nobody would want to hire an out-of-shape ex-Navy Seal. He followed his family out of the establishment and caught his son’s arm as they turned toward the southern line of the tram. 

“Oh, Robbie, we won’t be taking that line,” the father smiled.

Mary and Lucy stopped with knowing grins on their faces, already aware of the surprise that awaited Robbie.

“What do you mean, Dad?” 

“Well, your mother and I did buy one extra thing in addition to all the supplies for the trip. We thought, with how much you love space-travel, you might enjoy a pass aboard the observation deck pod. You wanna watch the launch?”

“Oh my God, seriously?” Robbie’s flat mouth curved upward into a toothy smile. “I never thought we’d be able to afford something like that. Is it just me?” 

“No, dummy,” Lucy laughed, running a hand through her brother’s wiry walnut hair. “Dad’s going with you. You know mom and I don’t care about all that. You better be back right after the jump to help unpack. I don’t care how cool it is, or how many hors d'oeuvres you eat, you are on folding duty.”

“Of course, I’ll fold!” he shouted gleefully. “I’ll sing if you want me to! I don’t care! I can’t believe I’m going to get to see it!” 

“We’ll be watching from the monitors in the rear pods, Rob,” Mary grinned as she embraced her son. “Take good care of your dad, okay? You know I love you?”


“Of course, Mom. Love you too!” Rob muttered absentmindedly, returning her hug before looking back to his father. “So, is it just us in the pod?” 

“No, it’s a communal observation rack. Everyone will be strapped in for safety purposes,” Nate elucidated. “It’s procedure at any takeoff, even for trips that shouldn’t be more than a couple of minutes.” 

“That’s amazing,” Robbie almost shouted, bouncing on his tiptoes. “I wonder what it’s going to look like. The cameras don’t pick up much on the unmanned trips, something about the singularity interfering with optical sensors. As soon as the ship pulls into the tear, everything just looks white.”

“We’ll leave you to it, explorer,” Mary sniffed, patting her son on the back. “Come right back as soon as the trip is done. I want to hear all about it.”

“Sure, Mom,” Robbie agreed. “See you soon! Love you, Lucy!” 

“Bye, Robbie!” Lucy called back with a wave as she and her mother made their way to the southbound tram. 

“I can not believe you got us tickets on the observation level! How much did that cost?” Robbie prodded, turning back toward his father.

“Don't worry about it. What are you most excited about seeing?”

“Oh jeez, I don't even know! You know how much I love black holes.”

“Well this isn't technically a black hole we’re flying into, is it? It doesn't have the anomalies that accompany—,” Nate tried to clarify, showcasing his newfound knowledge of inter-dimensional travel that he'd studied up on for the trip with his son.

“Well obviously!” Robbie blurted out. “Side-space doesn’t exist in our universe, I think? It’s a gravitational well in the space between—time and space?”

“Obviously, right,” Nate nodded as he waited among a nervous crowd for the northbound shuttle back to the observation deck. He pulled his bouncing son close as the crowd began to grow.

The terminal was packed with anxious future-residents, curious journalists, and impatient staff. Everyone just wanted to be there already. The anticipation was palpable. As he scanned the room, one particular set of legs caught Nathaniel's eye. Their pale hue and freckled calves looked familiar. The black and white pencil skirt that hugged a gratuitous rear end was equal parts enticing and disquieting. The curly blonde hair was—shit.

Nate straightened his gaze back to the transparent glass doors awaiting the tram's arrival. Why, of all the people in all the world, did it have to be her? He didn't even need to see the face of the stunning woman to recognize her. Cairstine Campbell, a ghost from his past, stood ready to haunt him at an all too intimate distance. 

“Let's, uh,” Nate began, pulling his son farther from the front of the line and Cairstine, “just wait for the next train.”

“But Dad!” his son stretched the last word in complaint. “Why?”

“Oh, my, God!” a woman's voice sang, putting such stress on the D that it sounded more like a T. “Is that Nate James?”

The normally sarcastic and borderline morose Scot lit up as excitement crossed her face. 

“Ha, ha, hey, Cairstine,” Nathaniel answered, trying to sound excited for her sake and uninterested for his son's simultaneously. The words wrestled their way out of his confused mouth with definite pauses punctuating each syllable. 

“Yupty these days, love?” Cairstine almost squealed as she wrapped Nate into an uninvited hug. 

“What am I up to? Uh, actually, taking my son to our pods for departure.”

“Oh shite, I cannae believe I didn't ask about this little one. You must be Roger? Roland?” 

Robbie looked to his father for permission to speak to the stranger. Nate shrugged in surrender to the awfully awkward situation. At this point refusing to answer could bring unwanted secrets to light. 

“It's Robbie, actually,” the boy corrected. 

“Robbie!” Cairstine nodded, pointing her fingers like guns at the boy. “That's right! God it was so long ago! When your daddy was overseas, he showed me pictures of you as a wee baby. We used to work together.”

Her eyes broke with Robbie for the most momentary of flashes to lock eyes with Nathaniel. Her rippling blue gaze seemed to echo the same ocean they visited once upon a time while he served overseas. The cool waters lapped around his ankles and threatened to drag him out in an irresistible riptide. He flicked his stare away from the woman and focused on the timer above the glass doors. 

45 seconds to arrival, 44, 43, 42...

“Did you hear me, Nate?”

Cairstine had apparently finished talking to Robbie and now stared awaiting an answer from the uncomfortable Nate. He glanced to his son for some hint as to what her question had been. 

“I told her we were staying on the observation deck for the jump, but I wasn't sure what pod when she asked. Which one is it, Dad?”

He shuffled while staring up at the still-lowering countdown. Thirty-three seconds. It was too long to stall. Cairstine was toying with him. He was sure her interest was in anything but good faith.

“Pod two,” he answered shortly. “Second row.”

“Small world!” she clapped. “I'm with the rest of the press in pod one. Looks like I'll be right under you.”

As she held her telling gaze straight at Nate, the brakes of the railcar let out a slight squeal from down the track. 

“It’s where I do my best work,” the lusty woman sighed almost silently.

“Well—nice to see you Cairstine. Who knows, maybe we'll even meet on Canaan. Probably not.”

Robbie looked up at his father. It wasn't like him to be so rude. He pondered this happening as the glass doors finally opened to invite the new passengers aboard. The northbound train was almost empty. Most living quarters were near the center of the craft. The observation deck was just before the bridge. 

As the doors closed with a chiming ding-dong, Cairstine pushed her way directly in front of Nate. She reached up to grasp the handrail and her blouse unfolded a bit like a blossoming flower. The scent of her invaded his nostrils. It hammered against his sensibilities as if it were a yoke of oxen ploughing through the countryside. 

Cairstine looked up to the ceiling of the car, confident she was being closely watched and listened to.

“It's been years since I've had a proper shag,” she whispered.

The man in front of the Scotswoman turned his head with a raised eyebrow. She tilted her head with a dismissive glare that seemed to bore through the poor bystander's forehead. He turned back round almost instantly.

“I'll be in the family room by the bathroom across from pod one in fifteen minutes. Get your boy settled. Excuse yourself.”

Nate looked to his right to see an entirely oblivious Robbie James staring out the window at the passing curves of the Andromeda. 

The gentle slopes were designed to be aerodynamically sound for repeated atmospheric descent. The entire ship resembled a bit of a Delta wing; an enormous A-shape coasting through space. Unfortunately, Nate's mind kept drifting back to other curves at hand.

Nate shook his head, shooting down her request for his own sake and Cairstine's. 

“Suit yourself, love. I don't beg for anyone—unless they break me first.”

Nathaniel closed his eyes and imagined himself somewhere else.

“Snap me like a fuckin’ twig,” she breathed. “Beat me and mark me.” 

It was going to be a long ride.



A few stops ahead of the trio, Sam had arrived at the fore reactor. Violet bit her lip slightly, still reeling from their previous encounter.

“I'll be just a few minutes. I really can't take you in here. Just wait outside and I'll be back before you know it,” Sam tried to comfort.

“Oh jeez, Daddy, can I play with toys while I'm here?” Violet pouted.

“Uh, well,” Sam nervously chuckled, trying to ignore the stirring in his trousers. “You don't have to wait if you don’t want to, babe.”

Violet sauntered close and kissed Sam on his cheek.

“I’m gonna go, but maybe we can meet up sometime very soon, my girthy Mr. Kent.”

A passing scientist rolled her eyes as she tapped her wrist to the doorway. The light from the reactor poured out as the steel doors opened and then closed behind her.

“Thanks for the good time, Violet,” he smirked, slapping her ass one last time for good measure. “And it’s doctor, actually.” 

Violet clapped her teeth together inches from his nose and giggled.

“Only gonna get that one in bed, babe,” she winked. 

The woman turned and spun, sending her dress skyward and giving a peek at all she wasn’t wearing. Sam stared as long as he could, watching her fit body saunter down the corridor. 

With a resigned sigh, he tapped his arm to the door's authentication panel. The portal slid open and revealed a scowling Dr. Kathleen Reynolds.

“Entertaining the locals, are we?” groaned the same scientist who'd entered a moment ago with dripping causticity that could only be conjured from a British mouth in such a short burst. Something about the way she raised her tone at the end of the sentence communicated just how harshly she judged Sam.

“Kat, come on,” Sam shrugged as he took off his watch and shoved it into a footlocker. His wallet and keycards joined shortly after in the tiny metal box. He slid a thumb over a square red window at the front and a loud click echoed up into the small transitional room. “Am I not allowed to have some fun?”

“Oh, and she seems very fun, love, if nothing else.”

“What's that supposed to mean?” Sam asked, grabbing a small tablet from a holster beside the glass doors to the reactor.

“Exactly what I intended it to,” she answered with a raised eyebrow. “One of the most intelligent minds on this ship and it's going to be rotten with syphilis before you're forty.”

Doctor Kathleen Reynolds was a genius in her own right. A graduate of Oxford's astrophysics programme, she proudly represented Great Britain aboard the Andromeda's science team. While Sam was the engineer in charge of the fusion cores, it was Kat's job to double-check the displacement arrays. 

Built on black project tech developed by DARPA, gravitational displacement arrays helped redirect the flow of gravitational forces while inside the tear. The desired effect was to mitigate any damage that the ship would retain from the dangerous journey's tidal forces—otherwise known as the massively powerful, terrifying gnashing teeth of a singularity, that ripped apart anything passing through the Event Horizon like taffy. 

She was not the lead astrophysicist on the project.

“Samson, you're late,” a heavyset man's voice called as he entered the warmer chamber that was separated from the fusion reaction only by crystalline glass radiation shielding.

“Yeah, well I'm here now. Let's begin the test.”

“It's already been completed,” the greying, bearded man replied with a frown. He gestured to a readout on the overhead which had a list of bar graphs all displaying values within the green nominal zones.

“We've gunned up the displacement panels to make sure they'll function under full load?” Sam wondered. 

“They've survived eleven trips just fine,” Kat reassured. “Twelve is my lucky number.”

“So that's a yes?” Sam clarified.

“It's a yes, Sam.” 

“I trust the functional output is up to your lofty expectations?” the rotund man continued with a scowl as he yanked the tablet back from Sam's hands.

“Listen, Brayan,” Sam began, “we are going to be working in close proximity for at least a few months. I would appreciate it if you left sarcasm out of the equation so that we can complete our jobs as professionals.”

“I am a professional,” Brayan replied by reflex. “I get to my post on time and do my job.” 

“Right,” Sam nodded, ignoring his jab. “Kat, did the displacement panels show appropriate reallocation of the limited gravitational forces acting on the ship at the moment?” 

From her station, Kat pointed to a visualization of rippling waves around the Andromeda showed the panels redirecting the orbital tug of Earth downward as artificial gravity for the ship. Much like the rest of the technology aboard Andromeda, this shifting of gravity was revolutionary. For a ship of Andromeda’s size, having consistent gravity across all floors without spinning the ship like a top was incredible. Most starships were built radially to accommodate the need for rotation in flight, but Andromeda was stacked like the ships from science-fiction movies of the 20th century. 

“See for yourself. The artificial gravity will obviously be lost as we travel through the gate, as the panels will be thrown into reverse to redistribute the forces away from the ship, but everyone should be strapped in by that point anyway,” Kat answered. “We’re go for launch.” 

“Oh, that’s what I like to hear! We can’t afford any mistakes. The world is watching our every move here today,” Sam replied with a blend of worry and determination.

“And if history has its eyes on us, shouldn't we be sure we are focused on the right things?” Brayan fussed as he stowed the tablets the team had been using to run their final checks. “All kidding aside, Samson, we really must be steadfast in our resolve and devotion. If we make mistakes on this, people die.”

“I know, Brayan,” Sam replied. “I designed and implemented these systems while the ship was in orbital dry-dock. I can handle myself.”

Sam sighed as he exited the room without saying goodbye to his colleagues. He unlocked the same box he'd stowed his sensitive belongings in and continued to think hard on Brayan's words. Sam knew the tech. He invented the tech. What right did that meddler have to dictate his life? 

Sam slammed his wrist to the doorframe and winced slightly as he underestimated the force behind his frustration. As he made his way into the main concourse, the volume rose from a slight employee whisper to the roar of open rushing crowds.

“If assistance is needed in finding your designated travel container, please see one of the blue phones along the right side of the terminal. An associate will be with you momentarily.”

Huddled groups of settlers moved this way and that, trying to maneuver around strangers packed tighter than sardines. Violet held Sam’s hand tightly as he pulled her toward the foremost hold of pods. Looking much like a roller-coaster rack of seats, long rows had ejected from nearby walls to accommodate the need for over six-thousand flight restraints. Large glowing letters hovered above the ends of the rows. The nearest rack had a huge “A-6-B” overhead. The first letter was the hold designation. The second number was the pod within the hold. The third letter was a side correspondence, either A or B. Each seat within the row was correspondingly numbered.

Sam sat on a steel bench nearby and looked up at the raw display of humanity appearing before him. He watched as whole families strapped themselves into their restraints. The magnetic locks wouldn't activate for another 40 minutes, but they were buckled in by their safety belt, nonetheless. They were free to leave at any time until the attendants came to check each row. Sam glanced at his watch.

“And we're back with our final set of the night, guys and gals,” a woman's warm smoky voice called from around the corner. “We are 'Up and Over,’ and it's been such a goddamn amazing time with y'all!” 

Lost from view, a crowd cheered at the pandering remark. 

“Thank you!” She continued, “We are very excited to be doing the last show in this solar system aboard Andromeda, and we can't wait to play our first on Canaan!”

Sam heard the people go wild again. It had been fourteen minutes. Sam wondered if that was where Violet went. He figured checking out the band might be a good idea and a fun one to boot.

Sam stood up from his seat and followed the source of the noise. The sizable group of onlookers came into view before the band.

Ahead of Sam on the stage stood a group of three bandmates with a beautiful southern female lead. Her jean shorts were faded and shredded at the bottom. Red cowgirl boots came up to just beneath her knees. A short, checkered flannel revealed a tight and tanned stomach. Her smile was what Sam found truly incredible. She grinned with her whole face. Every feature seemed to warmly welcome all their guests as though they were close family.

The lights flipped upward away from the crowd and dimmed the space around Sam. As the singer began to dance to the song's heavy guitar riff, her Auburn hair bounced along with her and shimmered in the spotlight.

Her energy was astounding. She managed to be effervescent without being over-the-top happy. She yanked the microphone from its stand so that she could move about freely to engage her fans.

The other band members wore large smiles. One on keyboard slammed the instrument as he stomped along. Sam tried to make out his features but kept finding his eyes drawn back to the busty singer who jiggled along with every stomp of her cowgirl boots. 

Sam was so enraptured by the performance that he hardly felt a woman flit closely to his side. Her hot breath fell heavily across Samson's dark arm. A clammy hand slipped itself into his.

“Sam we—uh. Are you sure this ship is okay?”

&amp;#x200B;

Keira raised her greatsword and took a deep breath.  


A Dreamthief was in front of her. She wanted to kill it. Smash it into pieces until every ounce of her fury had been satiated. And she would – in the proper order. Before she could turn the horrid thing into paste, the man floating inside its red-green liquid, his face locked in an expression of agony, came first. The sight of the Dreamthief sent shivers down her spine and threatened to evict her lunch from her stomach, but before she could act on that feeling, a Ranger was in need of rescuing.  


Her rage would not take precedence over his life.  


Most of the Rangers trapped inside the Dreamthieves would survive. For a time. The rates that their HP, MP, and Stamina were being drained seemed to be consistent, and their Levels were all at least in the high 20s. They had enough HP, Stamina, and MP left to spare for the Party to make an attempt at plumbing the depths of The Dungeon. If the fates were kind, and the Dungeon didn’t run too deep or throw an insurmountable obstacle at them, there was a chance that they would be able to shatter the Dungeon Core in time to save everyone. As far as plans went, it was...doable. Improbable, but doable, and they were no strangers to laughing in the face of overwhelming peril.  


Then there was Randor, the main point of failure in their strategy. Randor had been a Utility Class user until recently and was far behind the rest of the pack. He’d demanded he be allowed to participate in the Dungeon Crawl, and his request was accepted much for the same reason Malika’s was; a Dungeon was a prime place to earn EXP. His low Level was why he’d come, and it was also why his life was in danger of slipping away so soon. A Level 15 Ranger didn’t have much in the way of HP or MP. Randor couldn’t wait for them to conquer the Dungeon before his health drained to nothing. Either they took a gamble and tried to free him now, or they let him waste away as a fucking plant ate him alive.  


And his death would be on their heads. Each member of Riardin’s Rangers knew that Randor’s current dilemma had been avoidable. With the exception of Malika, one of them should have offered him a place in Rob’s party. A fledgling Ranger needed the extra Experience and the safety of Rob’s Vitality buffs more than anyone. But whether out of subconscious greed or simple thoughtlessness, they’d held onto their positions, and Randor had lacked the forthrightness to request a swap.  


*We’ll fix this. We’ll save him.* Keira’s muscles bulged as her grip on her greatsword tightened. *We won’t let him die.*  


She’d already experimented with severing the roots that were spreading out from the Dreamthieves and into the bark-lined walls and floors. In theory, at least. An instant before her greatsword would have sliced through, Danger Sense set off an alarm blaring in her head. Not for herself, but for Randor. She wasn’t aware of exactly what would happen to the man if she cut the roots, but it would end in his grisly and inevitable demise. Of that, she was certain.  


Which was fine. A frontal attack suited her better.  


Riardin’s Rangers took their positions, surrounding the Dreamthief on all sides. A chorus of nods confirmed that they were ready. In theory, they could have signaled the countdown verbally. The Dreamthief didn’t seem to have ears. In practice, none of them were willing to take any chances. An ally’s life was on the line, and Randor deserved no less than a miracle.  


She would make sure he got one.  


Keira adjusted her posture and sharpened her focus. *Five...four...three...two…*  


*One.*  


A red aura infused her greatsword as Power Slash bit deep into the Dreamthief’s outer layer. After a moment of resistance, her longtime companion cleaved straight through the front of the vampiric plant, shearing its plant-flesh straight off and spilling red-green liquid out onto the floor. The rest of Riardin’s Rangers launched their own attacks at the same time as hers. Power Shot-infused arrows, Malika’s lightning, and Zamira’s and Meyneth’s own Power Slashes all chipped away at the Dreamthief like a hailstorm striking on glass.  


Unfortunately, cracking its outer layer was the limit of their capabilities – they didn’t come close to her own raw strength, and for a plant, the thing was fucking tough. Roughly half of its ‘skin’ remained intact. The Dreamthief reacted to their assaults in an instant, letting out an earsplitting shriek and growing spiked tendrils within its inner layers. Keira moved to execute a follow-up attack, but Light As A Feather didn’t reduce her greatsword’s weight to the point where she could maneuver it like a pocket knife. She wouldn’t make it in time before it skewered Randor like a piece of raw meat hung up at a butcher’s shop.  


They’d expected as much. A split second after Riardin’s Rangers rained hell and fury down on the Dreamthief, a flurry of white motes burst inside of its gullet and dispersed just as quickly. Rob, having used the enchanted bracelet to teleport next to Randor, wrapped his body around the Ranger and cast Rampage. Spiked tendrils extended from what remained of the Dreamthief’s inner flesh and stabbed at Rob and Randor as they shot out of the front opening that Keira had sliced open. Several of the tendrils hit their mark, one piercing Rob in the stomach and another piercing through his and Randor’s shoulder in one strike. The smaller tendrils that had already been inserted into Randor’s ears and nose ripped out with a distressing sound similar to a knife being removed from a wound. Blood trailed through the air as they collapsed into a heap on the floor, Randor unconscious and Rob gritting his teeth in pain.  


But they were alive. Nothing else mattered.  


Rob released Randor and rolled away, groaning. He retrieved an HP Potion from the crate they’d left aside and swallowed it nearly in one go, putting to use what he’d once described as his ‘expert chugging skills’. Zamira appeared at Randor’s side in a blur of motion, carefully tipping another HP Potion down the man’s throat as Orn’tol, Vul’to, and Taleya tended to his injuries.  


As soon as she was sure that their ally was safe, Malika screamed at the top of her lungs and engulfed the Dreamthief in fire summoned from the depths of her hatred, turning the wretched, hideous thing into cinders. It let out animalistic cries as it burned, the light of its life extinguished not a moment too soon.  


Satisfying as watching the Dreamthief go up in flames was, Keira couldn’t help but glance at Malika with concern. This – to put it mildly – wasn’t how someone’s first Dungeon Crawl was supposed to go. Hopefully the act had given her some form of catharsis, because Keira knew exactly how the young mage was feeling right now. Malika wasn’t the only one who’d formed a grudge against their captors. Speaking truthfully, all of Riardin’s Rangers had. Some had fared better than others, but the dream had shaken each of them to their core. Meyneth especially; she hadn’t said a word since waking, responding to directions and suggestions with simple nods, a haunted look in her eyes. She’d withdrawn into a shell, and Keira hadn't the faintest idea of how to coax her into coming back out.  


Then there was Rob. Learning that he’d used Melancholy Resistance *Level 4* to save them had filled their group with deep senses of shame and horror. Even with Faster Learner hastening its growth, Keira had never heard of an instance of the Skill increasing that much. She knew he’d experienced hardship – everyone had – but seeing the depth of his suffering so plainly laid out made her want to break something.  


Which was to say nothing of the effects of Melancholy Resistance itself. In the past, Riardin had repeatedly warned her during not to activate the Skill, that it was an infection of the mind little different then Leveling High. The examples he’d given of his compatriots from the war that had fallen under Melancholy Resistance’s sway were...persuasive. And based on what Zamira had told them, they’d likely been minutes away from losing Rob. Permanently.  


All while Keira herself had been asleep and none the wiser. She tried to avoid examining Rob too overtly and only partially succeeded. Zamira promised them that he’d deactivated the Skill, but honestly, without her assurances, Keira wasn’t sure if she would’ve been able to tell. She’d never met a person with an active Melancholy Resistance, and as he was now, Rob wasn’t quite like himself.  


“Looks like we both lived,” Rob said, wiping drops of HP Potion off his lips. A smile slowly crept across his face. “That certainly went better than expected. I hope that makes up for being a dickhead and not including him in the Party straight away.”  


His hopeful tone was at odds with his appearance. Rob looked *haggard* in a way that was unlike the usual fatigue that resulted from surviving a harrowing experience. His mannerisms, motions, and the way he spoke were irregular in ways that were difficult to describe. Every action was delayed by a split second, like they were being manually planned and executed instead of coming about naturally. They weren’t fake or fabricated, but she could tell that simply being himself was taking visible effort. He was on his last legs, and it wasn’t difficult to understand why.  


Keira remembered when Melancholy Resistance’s effects reached her. Up until then, the Dreamthief had surrounded her with ghosts of the past. Her parents, Men’ta, Riardin, Tarric, Alia. Whispering words into her ears that the real people never would, but that cut deep all the same. Keira felt herself coming undone, slowly being ground away by the illusion’s sadism, and without the shared effects of Mind Resistance she doubted she would have lasted very long before accepting its offer of a comforting fantasy.  


Then, without warning, an all-consuming tranquility flooded her. The ghosts’ barbs that had been tearing her composure apart, the targeted attacks at her mind, suddenly felt...unimportant. Like raindrops flowing harmlessly down her skin. The ghosts had gaped at her, eyes wide with terror, as Keira gave them a serene smile.  


Her forehead split open a second after. Red-black tendrils burst forward and lanced through the ghosts, lifting them into the air as oozing liquid pumped through the tendrils and into their flesh. They screamed as they melted away, and Keira kept smiling.  


When she awoke some time later, the effects of Melancholy Resistance were gone, and already seemed like the remnants of a fading dream. But she’d already *been* dreaming, and dreams took place in the landscape of a person’s consciousness. She knew that what she’d witnessed was a visual representation of what the Skill was capable of. What it did to aspects of the mind. And she’d only been inflicted with a lesser version, a mere portion of its effects that were granted by the EXP Share.  


Rob had endured the full brunt of Melancholy Resistance for fifteen minutes.  


He was strong. Keira knew that he would recover from his ordeal and be himself again before long – gods, she had to believe that he would. But the Rangers’ lives were on a time limit, and they couldn’t afford to wait for everyone in the Party to get fully back on their feet. Keira forced herself to admit that she wouldn’t be able to overly rely on Rob during the Dungeon Crawl; he was simply too beaten-down. She would have to take point and hope that Danger Sense would keep her safe.  


*Things were so much easier when I fought alone again one or two enemies at a time,* Keira mused. *Now I have allies – friends – to care about. A burden, in some respects, but one that is easily worth carrying for the sake of the blessing it provides.*  


She glanced at the Party and steeled her resolve. *No one dies today.*  


Orn’tol stepped towards his sister. “Malika,” he said, in a gentle tone. “You leveled up twice from finishing off the Dreamthief, correct? Please put your points into Vitality and Endurance again.” She nodded, offering no words of disagreement. Keira eyed the Party Screen as she watched Malika’s HP and Stamina increase. The young mage, enamored as she was by her own spellcasting, had been sorely neglecting those stats in favor of Magic and Mind.  


Which was to say nothing of her Strength, currently sitting at a miserable *6.* The very thought of it disgusted Keira, but now wasn’t the time to educate Malika on the finer points of hitting things. At the moment, Malika needed durability to survive. Should the unthinkable happen, and a Dreamthief entrap her again, every extra point of Vitality and Endurance would serve to keep her alive until she could be rescued.  


If she could be rescued. Their plan to free Randor had been carried out flawlessly, but it had only succeeded *because* their execution had been flawless. There was no guarantee that they could pull it off again.  


“I would caution against attempting to free the others as we did Randor,” Zamira said, echoing Keira’s thoughts. “A single misstep would have ended with one or both of Rob and Randor dead. Replicating the feat an additional eleven times is beyond our capabilities.”  


They’d stormed the Dungeon with twenty people. Rob’s Party, eight Rangers, two Healers, Elder Alessia, and Randor. It was meant to be overkill. A swift end to an encroaching stain upon the land. Their numbers had only given the Dungeon more toys to play with. As the situation was now, if they couldn’t expunge the Core in time, a scant nine of their allies would walk away from this Crawl intact. Assuming everyone currently free of the Dreamthieves’ clutches managed to survive until the end.  


Which was assuming quite a lot. The day was young, and they had yet to descend from the first goddamn floor.  


“If saving them directly is beyond our means,” Vul’to said, “Then we should continue deeper into the Dungeon.” He peered down at Randor, still unconscious. “What shall we do with him? If he wakes up before we clear the Dungeon and decides to follow us into its depths...well, I fear that he won’t last long.”  


Taleya was staring at Randor, her face taut. She whispered something under her breath and shook her head.  


“Write him a note,” Taleya said, her voice hollow. “Explain the situation. It’s the best we can do. Does anyone have writing implements in their personal space in Rob’s Storage?”  


A few beats passed. “I do,” Meyneth said, wilting at her own words. Rob nodded and stretched out his hand towards her. Meyneth flinched at the motion, shivering slightly as she grabbed Rob’s hand and produced a pen and paper from her Storage. The rest of the Party took a quick respite as she hastily wrote a note and placed it on Randor’s chest. She eyed everyone fearfully after she was done, as if waiting for someone or something to lash out at her.  


Vul’to graced her with a warm smile. “Good foresight,” he said. “We might have further need of writing utensils in the future, as well.”  


Meyneth’s jaw fell open. She stared at him intently, Vul’to’s smile faltering slightly as the seconds crawled.  


Rob rubbed his eyes, shrugged, and turned to face the wall of darkness that was their only exit from the room. “Everyone ready?” he asked. The Party assented. “Okey-dokey then. Let’s-”  


Keira interrupted him by putting a hand on his shoulder. “You can’t,” she said, kindly. “Stay in the back in case Malika is ambushed.”  


He looked about to protest before hesitating a moment later. Rob sighed, rubbing his temples with both hands as he screwed his eyes shut. “You’re right,” he said. “Just...take care of yourself, please. The Dungeon won’t play fair, and your build isn’t suited for tanking hits. Shared Regeneration isn’t going to mean much in a short, brutal fight.” He smirked. “If you die, I swear I’ll kick your ass.”  


Keira put on a smile that she hoped was confident. “Your concern is heartwarming, but misplaced. Mark my words – I won’t take a single point of damage.”  


A few months ago, she would have believed herself. The Bestial Chimera and the Mine had disabused her of that notion. No one was perfect, and no one was untouchable, with or without Danger Sense. She was treading into an unknowable danger where her choices were kill or be killed. The Dungeon would undoubtedly throw monstrously strong foes at her, foes that would test the limits of her combat prowess. One wrong move could very well spell her demise.  


She suppressed a manic grin as the thought sent her heart racing and her blood pumping.  


–  


*Fuck, I’m tired.*  


Rob closed his eyes and opened them again. Calling it blinking would have been too generous – he was trying to catch bits of microsleep in order to stave off the insistent desire to pass out then and there. It felt like he’d pulled two all-nighters in a row and gone straight to math class at 7 AM. *Why is there no coffee in Elatra?* He bemoaned. *Must this world spite me at every turn?*  


He made a necessary decision and put 5 of his unspent stat points into Endurance. Maybe the increased Stamina would help take the edge off. The remaining 5 points were split between Strength and Magic, as he was lacking in pure offensive power when compared to his cohorts, and because his Skills that consumed MP were proving to be increasingly vital to his survival.  


**Climbing Level Increased! 2 → 3**  


**Fleet of Foot Level Increased! 4 → 5**  


**Active Skill Learned!**  
**Name:** Second Wind  
**Prerequisite:** Endurance 30, reach 1% or lower Stamina at least once.  
**Description:** Get back on your feet, you lazy bag of bones. You can rest when you’re dead. Take a single deep breath to instantly restore 30% of your maximum Stamina. Cannot be used without breathable oxygen in the area. Cannot be used if your lungs are nonfunctional.  
**Cooldown:** 24 Hours  


The Skill was appreciated, and Rob did feel a bit less like a shambling corpse than before, but the boost to his Endurance was more like slapping duct tape on a leaking pipe than fixing the actual problem. He needed rest, actual rest, and that wasn’t happening until they’d expunged the Dungeon and gotten everyone home.  


Keira had been right, unfortunately. He was in no condition to lead the way. It would have been hard to portray an inspiring presence for everyone to follow when he was barely able to keep his balance on the massive roots that the Party was creeping their way down. Crossing through the wall of darkness had transported them into the interior of an even bigger hollowed-out tree – much, much bigger. Gnarled, five-foot-wide roots spread downwards in a way that vaguely resembled a path for them to traverse downwards. Convenient, if not for the wide empty spaces in-between the roots, and the long trip to the bottom that would befall anyone who slipped. Rob might be able to survive if he activated Not a Scratch before hitting the bottom, but the others wouldn’t be so lucky.  


It was for that reason that Rob did his best to stay alert despite dreamland calling his name. He’d witnessed what the end result of an Infected animal falling off a cliff looked like and had no desire to see the sequel acted out by a friend. If someone slipped, he would dive after them, Rampage to propel himself underneath them, grab them, face them upwards, and use Not A Scratch before they hit the ground. The two of them would be alone at the bottom of the tree, and a horde of monsters would probably pop out of nowhere and introduce themselves as soon as Rob Airlines landed, but at least both of them would be alive. He would figure out how to un-fuck their situation afterwards.  


“Where are the monsters?” Malika whispered. “I thought a Dungeon would be full of them.”  


“Hiding, probably,” Orn’tol whispered back. “Be on your guar-”  


*Creak.*  


A branch broke off from one of the roots and took a swipe at Orn’tol. No, not a branch, a spindly man-sized bug thing that had been camouflaged to look exactly like bark as long as it didn’t move. It reminded Rob heavily of Stickbugs, except that Stickbugs didn’t have scythes at the ends of their hands or spit acid out of their mouths. At least he didn’t *think* they did. He wouldn’t rule out Australia having a similar variant.  


In the time it took for Rob to snap out of his dazed internal rambling, eight more Stickbugs had crawled out of the woodwork and were advancing fast on the Party. The one closest to Orn’tol had been bisected by Keira, her Danger Sense having sensed the ambush coming. Rob hadn’t even drawn his weapon yet.  


*Gotta focus. ‘Identify.’*  


**Name:** Creeping Phasmatodea  
**Level:** 17  
**Status Effects:** Territorial  
**Description:** You’re not going to remember the name ‘Phasmatodea’, are you? You’ll just keep calling them Stickbugs.  


*Damn right.*  


The Party took potshots at the Stickbugs as they crawled along the roots faster than Rob would have expected, legs skittering and twitching like spiders and oh boy he did not like the memories that association brought to the surface. While the Stickbugs weren’t strong – a single arrow from Vul’to snapped one in half – they were agile and used the giant roots as cover. Bereft of a proper projectile, Rob was relegated to repeatedly throwing and re-summoning the Broken Shortsword. Compared to the ranged attacks put out by the Rangers and Malika, he kind of felt like a kid sitting at the adults’ table and pretending he mattered.  


Then the hilt of his Shortsword miraculously bonked one of the Stickbugs on the head – and promptly blew its skull open.  


**Passive Skill Learned!**  
**Name:** Throwing Proficiency  
**Prerequisite:** Defeat or heavily injure at least three worthwhile opponents using throwing implements. Improvised implements count.  
**Description:** Been practicing your fastball? Apparently, the answer is yes. Slightly increases your aim when throwing shit at shit. Damage incurred by hitting an enemy with a thrown weapon or object is increased by 5%.  


Rob whistled as he summoned the Shortsword and threw it again, revising his estimates of how much 35 Strength, plus the damage bonus from Headsman, plus the damage bonus against insectlike creatures from Arachnophobia was worth.  


Five Stickbugs were left by the time they reached the Party. Process of elimination had deemed them as best of their kind, and it showed in how they used actual strategy when harassing the Party. Instead of engaging in a direct confrontation where Keira or Zamira would slice them in a heartbeat, they danced between roots, attacking from underneath and backing out before a retaliatory strike could be made. One managed to nick Orn’tol’s ankle, causing minimal damage but almost knocking the boy off – without Meyneth grabbing him and bracing herself against the root with her claws, Rob Airlines would have had its maiden flight sooner than expected.  


*They don’t have to beat us,* Rob thought, grimacing. *They just need to trip us up and let gravity do the rest.*  


Keira’s eyes bulged. Rob turned around before she had a chance to say anything – he knew what that look of panic meant. He drew his longsword and Power Slashed through the Stickbug that was sneaking up behind him, its two halves falling off opposite sides of the root. With a grimace, he realized that he hadn’t killed one of the ones they were already fighting. That had been Stickbug #9, and Rob could only stand and watch in bewilderment as #10 through #16 dropped down from the ceiling, divebombing the Party in a maneuver that, frankly speaking, was rude and uncalled for.  


Two of the newcomers missed the branch entirely and fell silently to their deaths. Two more were shot out of the air by Taleya and Orn’tol. Zamira cut down one that landed next to her, and another was blown apart by a lightning bolt from Malika. The final crazy-ass kamikaze Stickbug landed next to Meyneth and was torn to shreds by her claws.  


Leaving her distracted and unable to dodge an attack from one of the five original bugs that cut across her torso. She cursed, stumbled, reached for the ledge, and failed.  


“I’VE GOT HER!” Rob yelled as he jumped. “THISLOOKSBADBUTWE’LLBOTHBEFINE!” *I really should have explained this plan ahead of time.* Ignoring the confused shouts from the rest of the Party, Rob cast Rampage once to rocket ahead of Meyneth, maneuvered behind her, and grabbed her from the back. The ground was fast approaching, and with seconds remaining, he activated Not A Scratch.  


Meyneth had other plans. Her leg muscles tightened, and with a soft glow, hardened until they were solid as stone. She twisted her body and was barely able to touch her feet on a root they were falling past. All at once, their downward momentum was transferred from vertical to horizontal as Meyneth kicked off against the root with enough force to send spiderwebs of cracks running through it. Rob held on tight as she soared through the air, reaching the far wall of the tree interior and kicking off of that as well, angling them towards the ground. His teeth rattled as Meyneth landed hard, bending her knees to absorb the force of impact. A moment later, she stood up straight, resolute and unharmed, her HP and Stamina close to full.  


“That was more turbulence than I expected,” Rob muttered as he let go.  


“What?” Meyneth asked, panting.  


“Don’t worry about it. You’ll learn to ignore my Earth references soon enough.” Rob wiped a sheen of sweat off his brow. He summoned an MP Potion and chugged it at record speeds to offset the loss from using Rampage. Their supply of Potions wasn’t infinite, but better to be alive with empty pockets than a corpse with full ones. “What Skill was that?” Rob asked once he’d finished. He summoned another Potion and held it out to Meyneth; whatever she’d used had probably cost MP as well.  


Meyneth shuffled in place as she gingerly accepted the MP Potion, but didn’t start drinking it. “Leap,” she answered. “It hardens my legs and increases their strength. Allows me to jump great distances without suffering backlash.”  


Rob let out a nervous chuckle. “That’s pretty badass. Now I feel dumb for trying to play hero when you had yourself covered.” He looked up from where they’d fallen, the distant sounds of battle resounding throughout the open air. They were at least 500 feet down, probably more. There were roots leading back up, but climbing them would be a much more daunting task than descending, and the battle would be finished before they were a tenth of the way there.  


“We should stand underneath everyone,” Rob said. “In case someone else falls. You can Leap up to catch them, and I’ll be your cheerleader. Think you can handle snatching people out of the air if they slip?”  


“I must apologize.”  


Rob did a double-take. “That...came out of nowhere,” he said, raising an eyebrow at Meyneth. She averted her gaze, wearing a stoic expression that looked fragile as glass. He hadn’t seen her look so vulnerable since first meeting her at the Human prison.  


“I fell,” she said, quietly. “This error forced you to abandon the Party in an attempt to protect me. Had I acquitted myself better, neither of us would be down here. I have separated both of us from the group in a time of need. Unacceptable.”  


She spat out the last word. “You would have been better-suited having someone else in the Party,” she continued, voice hitching. “Someone more competent. Your pity for me has been to your detriment, and for that, I must apologize.”  


*Oh jeez. Diplomacy?*  


Silence. It was there, but subdued, almost as if it was hibernating.  


*Shit. Okay.*  


Rob gently grasped her hands. Diplomacy’s absence was felt a moment later as Meyneth let out a little gasp and flinched, her claws extending an inch and piercing through his palms and out the other end. She stared down at what she’d done, a look of stricken horror on her face. Rob bit his tongue and forced a comforting smile to his face, keeping his hands clasped in hers.  


“Anyone could have fallen off,” he said. “Don’t beat yourself up too much, seriously. I once blew myself up and they still haven’t let me hear the end of it. And what’s this about pity? You’re a good person, and we all like you. If you’re here, it’s because the others and I wanted you here. If pity was a barometer for inclusion in my Party, then there’s plenty of sadsacks out there that I could’ve chosen. Trust me, people can get *weird* when Fast Learner is on the table. You don’t, and that means a lot.”  


*I think I’m getting decent at giving mid-Dungeon pep talks,* Rob mused. He paused, wondering if he should be more direct, before throwing caution to the wind and laying it on thick. “I don’t know what you saw in the illusion,” he said, looking her straight in the eyes. “But whatever happened is in the past. You’re among friends now. I’m not saying you can or should immediately get over what you saw – I would be a huge fucking hypocrite if I did. But at least let me say that I think you’re pretty awesome. You’re brave, helpful, smart, and cool. Also, a pair of giant mushrooms just popped out of a hole in the ground and I’m gonna need your help dealing with that.”  


**Name:** Sporeking  
**Level:** 30  
**Status Effects:** Territorial  
**Description:** Made of plantlike flesh, but its arms are strong enough to bend steel. Can be wounded easily, but regenerates quickly and will endure large amounts of punishment before expiring. Slow but relentless.  
**Analyze Weakness Has Triggered! -** A Sporeking releases noxious fumes when damaged. Trace amounts will be expelled when being damaged by physical means. This should cause no real harm unless inhaled for extended periods of time. Elemental attacks such as fire will cause the Sporeking to explode, shooting massive amounts of fumes in every direction. A single full breath will guarantee a protracted and agonizing death.  


What kind of drugs – and how many – was the Dungeon on when it designed a twelve-foot tall mushroom with beefy arms and legs? Rob let go of Meyneth’s hands, ignoring the feeling of her claws sliding back out of his palms, and produced a longsword from his Storage. “I can’t kill both of these things on my own,” he said. “It would be a close call even if I was at my best, which I am most certainly not. What say you and I tag team that tall, muscular duo who want to pound us?”  


Meyneth was quiet. The Sporekings started to lumber forward, taking long, plodding steps.  


“Brave, helpful, smart, and cool,” she echoed in a hesitant tone. “You really think I’m all those things?”  


She’d taken a major risk and joined the Deserters out of a desire for a better life. She kept him alive when the Locus of Power was using his brain as a stress ball. She was apparently some math and art savant. And she was a strong dragon lady who spoke softly and carried a big stick.  


Sure, they didn’t know each other very well. Not yet. Rob would fix that as soon as the Dungeon Crawl was finished. Giving her as much space as he had was a mistake. She *clearly* needed some positive reinforcement, and based on the insights into her character that he’d gleaned from their – admittedly limited – interactions, she deserved it. His weeks spent in The Village around people who hated him had given him a sort of sixth sense regarding who would make a good ally. Meyneth wouldn’t just be a good ally; she would be a good friend. All she needed was for people to reach out to her.  


Plus, seeing her be so down on herself kind of pissed him off. A bit of extra flattery couldn’t hurt.  


“You’re all those things and more,” Rob answered.  


A hint of a smile spread across her face. She raised the MP Potion he’d given her, opened her mouth wide, and popped the entire thing in at once, bottle and all. Rob stared in shock as Meyneth chewed the MP Potion with gusto, the sound of crunching glass prickling his inner eardrums. Even the Sporekings momentarily halted their advance, sunken-in eyes widening slightly.  


After what felt like an eternity, Meyneth swallowed. Her claws lengthened, she adopted a fighting stance, and her smile returned in full force, two rows of sharklike teeth that looked evolved to tear someone’s throat out.  


“Then what else can I do but live up to your expectations?” She said, each word more confident than the last.  


Rob laughed. *Yeah, you’ll fit in just fine.*  


They charged, sword and claw rending through plant-flesh as the struggle to survive began anew.

# INTRODUCTION 

 The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly in creased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in“advanced” countries, but they have destabilized society,have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human being stein dignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human being to greater in-dignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world,it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in “advanced” countries.2. The industrial-technological system may survive or it may break down. If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve low level of physical and psychological suffering, but only after passing through a long and very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine.Furthermore, if the system survives, the consequences will be inevitable: There is no way of reforming or modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy.3. If the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful. But the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results of its breakdown will be, so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner rather than later.4. We therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system. This revolution may or may not make use of violence; it may be sudden or it may be a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades. We can’t predict any of that. But we do outline in a very general way the measures that those who hate the industrial system should take in order to prepare the way for a revolution against that form of society. This is not to be a POLITICAL revolution. Its object will be to overthrow not governments but the economic and technological basis of the present society.5. In this article we give attention to only some of the negative developments that have grown out of the industrial technological system. Other such developments we mention only briefly or ignore altogether. This does not

#  OVERSOCIALIZATION 

 24. Psychologists use the term “socialization” to desi-gnate the process by which children are trained to thinkand act as society demands. A person is said to be wellsocialized if he believes in and obeys the moral code ofhis society and fits in well as a functioning part of thatsociety. It may seem senseless to say that many leftists areover-socialized, since the leftist is perceived as a rebel.Ne-vertheless, the position can be defended. Many leftists arenot such rebels as they seem.25. The moral code of our society is so demanding thatno one can think, feel and act in a completely moral way.For example, we are not supposed to hate anyone, yetalmost everyone hates somebody at some time or other,whether he admits it to himself or not. Some people areso highly socialized that the attempt to think, feel andact morally imposes a severe burden on them. In order  to avoid feelings of guilt, they continually have to deceivethemselves about their own motives and find moral ex-planations for feelings and actions that in reality have anonmoral origin. We use the term “oversocialized” to des-cribe such people. \[2\]26. Oversocialization can lead to low self-esteem, asense of powerlessness, defeatism, guilt, etc. One of themost important means by which our society socializeschildren is by making them feel ashamed of behavior orspeech that is contrary to society’s expectations. If this isoverdone, or if a particular child is especially susceptibleto such feelings, he ends by feeling ashamed of HIMSELF.Moreover the thought and the behavior of the oversocia-lized person are more restricted by society’s expectationsthan are those of the lightly socialized person. The majo-rity of people engage in a significant amount of naughtybehavior. They lie, they commit petty thefts, they breaktraffic laws, they goof off at work, they hate someone, theysay spiteful things or they use some underhanded trick toget ahead of the other guy. The oversocialized person can-not do these things, or if he does do them he generatesin himself a sense of shame and self-hatred. The over-socialized person cannot even experience, without guilt,thoughts or feelings that are contrary to the accepted mo-rality; he cannot think “unclean” thoughts. And socializa-tion is not just a matter of morality; we are socialized toconform to many norms of behavior that do not fall underthe heading of morality. Thus the oversocialized person iskept on a psychological leash and spends his life runningon rails that society has laid down for him. In many over-socialized people this results in a sense of constraint andpowerlessness that can be a severe hardship. We suggestthat oversocialization is among the more serious crueltiesthat human being inflict on one another.27. We argue that a very important and influential seg-ment of the modern left is oversocialized and that theiroversocialization is of great importance in determiningthe direction of modern leftism. Leftists of the overso-cialized type tend to be intellectuals or members of theupper-middle class. Notice that university intellectuals\[3\]constitute the most highly socialized segment of our so-ciety and also the most leftwing segment.28. The leftist of the oversocialized type tries to get offhis psychological leash and assert his autonomy by rebel-ling. But usually he is not strong enough to rebel againstthe most basic values of society. Generally speaking, thegoals of today’s leftists are NOT in conflict with the accep-ted morality. On the contrary, the left takes an acceptedmoral principle, adopts it as its own, and then accusesmainstream society of violating that principle. Examples:racial equality, equality of the sexes, helping poor people,peace as opposed to war, nonviolence generally, freedomof expression, kindness to animals. More fundamentally,the duty of the individual to serve society and the dutyof society to take care of the individual. All these havebeen deeply rooted values of our society (or at least of itsmiddle and upper classes \[4\] for a long time. These va-lues are explicitly or implicitly expressed or presupposedin most of the material presented to us by the mainstreamcommunications media and the educational system. Leftists, especially those of the oversocialized type, usuallydo not rebel against these principles but justify their hos-tility to society by claiming (with some degree of truth)that society is not living up to these principles.29. Here is an illustration of the way in which the over-socialized leftist shows his real attachment to the conven-tional attitudes of our society while pretending to be inrebellion aginst it. Many leftists push for affirmative ac-tion, for moving black people into high-prestige jobs, forimproved education in black schools and more money forsuch schools; the way of life of the black “underclass” theyregard as a social disgrace. They want to integrate theblack man into the system, make him a business execu-tive, a lawyer, a scientist just like upper-middle-class whitepeople. The leftists will reply that the last thing they wantis to make the black man into a copy of the white man; ins-tead, they want to preserve African American culture. Butin what does this preservation of African American cultureconsist? It can hardly consist in anything more than ea-ting black-style food, listening to black-style music, wea-ring black-style clothing and going to a black-style churchor mosque. In other words, it can express itself only in su-perficial matters. In all ESSENTIAL respects most leftistsof the oversocialized type want to make the black manconform to white, middle-class ideals. They want to makehim study technical subjects, become an executive or ascientist, spend his life climbing the status ladder to provethat black people are as good as white. They want to makeblack fathers “responsible,” they want black gangs to be-come nonviolent, etc. But these are exactly the values ofthe industrial- technological system. The system couldn’tcare less what kind of music a man listens to, what kindof clothes he wears or what religion he believes in as longas he studies in school, holds a respectable job, climbs thestatus ladder, is a “responsible” parent, is nonviolent andso forth. In effect, however much he may deny it, the over-socialized leftist wants to integrate the black man into thesystem and make him adopt its values.30. We certainly do not claim that leftists, even of theoversocialized type, NEVER rebel against the fundamen-tal values of our society. Clearly they sometimes do. Someoversocialized leftists have gone so far as to rebel againstone of modern society’s most important principles by en-gaging in physical violence. By their own account, vio-lence is for them a form of “liberation.” In other words,by committing violence they break through the psycholo-gical restraints that have been trained into them. Becausethey are oversocialized these restraints have been moreconfining for them than for others; hence their need tobreak free of them. But they usually justify their rebellionin terms of mainstream values. If they engage in violencethey claim to be fighting against racism or the like.31. We realize that many objections could be raised tothe foregoing thumbnail sketch of leftist psychology. Thereal situation is complex, and anything like a completedescription of it would take several volumes even if thenecessary data were available. We claim only to have in-dicated very roughly the two most important tendenciesin the psychology of modern leftism.32. The problems of the leftist are indicative of the problems of our society as a whole. Low self-esteem, depres-sive tendencies and defeatism are not restricted to the left.Though they are especially noticeable in the left, they arewidespread in our society. And today’s society tries to so-cialize us to a greater extent than any previous society. Weare even told by experts how to eat, how to exercise, howto make love, how to raise our kids and so forth. 

#  THE POWER PROCESS 

 33. Human beings have a need (probably based in bio-logy) for something that we will call thepower process.This is closely related to the need for power (which iswidely recognized) but is not quite the same thing. Thepower process has four elements. The three most clear-cut of these we call goal, effort and attainment of goal.(Everyone needs to have goals whose attainment requireseffort, and needs to succeed in attaining at least some ofhis goals.) The fourth element is more difficult to defineand may not be necessary for everyone. We call it auto-nomy and will discuss it later (paragraphs 42-44).34. Consider the hypothetical case of a man who canhave anything he wants just by wishing for it. Such a manhas power, but he will develop serious psychological pro-blems. At first he will have a lot of fun, but by and by he will become acutely bored and demoralized. Eventually hemay become clinically depressed. History shows that leisured aristocracies tend to become decadent. This is not true of fighting aristocracies that have to struggle to maintain their power. But leisured, secure aristocracies that have no need to exert themselves usually become bored, hedonis-tic and demoralized, even though they have power. Thisshows that power is not enough. One must have goals to-ward which to exercise one’s power.35. Everyone has goals; if nothing else, to obtain thephysical necessities of life: food, water and whatever clo-thing and shelter are made necessary by the climate. Butthe leisured aristocrat obtains these things without effort.Hence his boredom and demoralization.36. Nonattainment of important goals results in deathif the goals are physical necessities, and in frustration if non-attainment of the goals is compatible with survival.Consistent failure to attain goals throughout life resultsindefeatism, low self-esteem or depression.37. Thus, in order to avoid serious psychological pro-blems, a human being needs goals whose attainment re-quires effort, and he must have a reasonable rate of suc-cess in attaining his goals.

#  

#  AUTONOMY 

 42. Autonomy as a part of the power process may notbe necessary for every individual. But most people needa greater or lesser degree of autonomy in working to-ward their goals. Their efforts must be undertaken ontheir own initiative and must be under their own direc-tion and control. Yet most people do not have to exert thisinitiative, direction and control as single individuals. It isusually enough to act as a member of a SMALL group.Thus if half a dozen people discuss a goal among them-selves and make a successful joint effort to attain thatgoal, their need for the power process will be served. Butif they work under rigid orders handed down from abovethat leave them no room for autonomous decision and ini-tiative, then their need for the power process will not beserved. The same is true when decisions are made on acollective basis if the group making the collective decisionis so large that the role of each individual is insignificant.\[5\]43. It is true that some individuals seem to have littleneed for autonomy. Either their drive for power is weak orthey satisfy it by identifying themselves with some power-ful organization to which they belong. And then there areunthinking, animal types who seem to be satisfied with apurely physical sense of power (the good combat soldier,who gets his sense of power by developing fighting skillsthat he is quite content to use in blind obedience to hissuperiors).  44. But for most people it is through the power process— having a goal, making an AUTONOMOUS effort andattaining the goal — that self-esteem, self-confidence anda sense of power are acquired. When one does not haveadequate opportunity to go through the power process theconsequences are (depending on the individual and onthe way the power process is disrupted) boredom, demo-ralization, low self-esteem, inferiority feelings, defeatism,depression, anxiety, guilt, frustration, hostility, spouse orchild abuse, insatiable hedonism, abnormal sexual beha-vior, sleep disorders, eating disorders. etc. \[6\]  

#  SOURCES OF SOCIAL PROBLEMS 

 45. Any of the foregoing symptoms can occur in anysociety, but in modern industrial society they are presenton a massive scale. We aren’t the first to mention that theworld today seems to be going crazy. This sort of thing isnot normal for human societies. There is good reason tobelieve that primitive man suffered from less stress andfrustration and was better satisfied with his way of lifethan modern man is. It is true that not all was sweet-ness and light in primitive societies. Abuse of women wascommon among the Australian aborigines, transexualitywas fairly common among some of the American Indiantribes. But it does appear that GENERALLY SPEAKING thekinds of problems that we have listed in the preceding pa-ragraph were far less common among primitive peoplesthan they are in modern society.46. We attribute the social and psychological problemsof modern society to the fact that that society requirespeople to live under conditions radically different fromthose under which the human race evolved and to be-have in ways that conflict with the patterns of behaviorthat the human race developed while living under theearlier conditions. It is clear from what we have alreadywritten that we consider lack of opportunity to properlyexperience the power process as the most important ofthe abnormal conditions to which modern society subjectspeople. But it is not the only one. Before dealing with dis-ruption of the power process as a source of social pro-blems we will discuss some of the other sources.47. Among the abnormal conditions present in modernindustrial society are excessive density of population, iso-lation of man from nature, excessive rapidity of socialchange and the breakdown of natural small-scale commu-nities such as the extended family, the village or the tribe.48. It is well known that crowding increases stress andaggression. The degree of crowding that exists today andthe isolation of man from nature are consequences of tech-nological progress. All pre-industrial societies were pre-dominantly rural. The Industrial Revolution vastly increa-sed the size of cities and the proportion of the populationthat lives in them, and modern agricultural technologyhas made it possible for the Earth to support a far den-ser population than it ever did before. (Also, technologyexacerbates the effects of crowding because it puts increa-sed disruptive powers in people’s hands. For example, a  variety of noise-making devices: power mowers, radios,motorcycles, etc. If the use of these devices is unrestric-ted, people who want peace and quiet are frustrated bythe noise. If their use is restricted, people who use thedevices are frustrated by the regulations. But if these ma-chines had never been invented there would have been noconflict and no frustration generated by them.)49. For primitive societies the natural world (whichusually changes only slowly) provided a stable frameworkand therefore a sense of security. In the modern world itis human society that dominates nature rather than theother way around, and modern society changes very ra-pidly owing to technological change. Thus there is nostable framework.50. The conservatives are fools: They whine about thedecay of traditional values, yet they enthusiastically sup-port technological progress and economic growth. Appa-rently it never occurs to them that you can’t make rapid,drastic changes in the technology and the economy of asociety without causing rapid changes in all other aspectsof the society as well, and that such rapid changes inevi-tably break down traditional values.51. The breakdown of traditional values to some extentimplies the breakdown of the bonds that hold togethertraditional small-scale social groups. The disintegrationof small-scale social groups is also promoted by the factthat modern conditions often require or tempt individualsto move to new locations, separating themselves fromtheir communities. Beyond that, a technological societyHAS TO weaken family ties and local communities if it isto function efficiently. In modern society an individual’sloyalty must be first to the system and only secondarily toa smallscale community, because if the internal loyaltiesof small-scale communities were stronger than loyalty tothe system, such communities would pursue their own ad-vantage at the expense of the system.52. Suppose that a public official or a corporation exe-cutive appoints his cousin, his friend or his co-religionistto a position rather than appointing the person best qua-lified for the job. He has permitted personal loyalty to su-persede his loyalty to the system, and that is “nepotism”or “discrimination,” both of which are terrible sins in mo-dern society. Would-be industrial societies that have donea poor job of subordinating personal or local loyalties toloyalty to the system are usually very inefficient. (Look atLatin America.) Thus an advanced industrial society cantolerate only those small-scale communities that are emas-culated, tamed and made into tools of the system. \[7\]53. Crowding, rapid change and the breakdown of com-munities have been widely recognized as sources of socialproblems. But we do not believe tbey are enough to ac-count for the extent of the problems that are seen today.54. A few pre-industrial cities were very large and crow-ded, yet their inhabitants do not seem to have sufferedfrom psychological problems to the same extent as mo-dern man. In America today there still are uncrowded ru-ral areas, and we find there the same problems as in urbanareas, though the problems tend to be less acute in the ru-ral areas. Thus crowding does not seem to be the decisivefactor.  55. On the growing edge of the American frontier du-ring the 19th century, the mobility of the population pro-bably broke down extended families and small-scale so-cial groups to at least the same extent as these are bro-ken down today. In fact, many nuclear families lived bychoice in such isolation, having no neighbors within seve-ral miles, that they belonged to no community at all, yetthey do not seem to have developed problems as a result.56. Furthermore, change in American frontier societywas very rapid and deep. A man might be born and rai-sed in a log cabin, outside the reach of law and order andfed largely on wild meat; and by the time he arrived atold age he might be working at a regular job and livingin an ordered community with effective law enforcement.This was a deeper change than that which typically occursin the life of a modern individual, yet it does not seemto have led to psychological problems. In fact, 19th cen-tury American society had an optimistic and self-confidenttone, quite unlike that of today’s society. \[8\]57. The difference, we argue, is that modern man hasthe sense (largely justified) that change is IMPOSED onhim, whereas the 19th century frontiersman had the sense(also largely justified) that he created change himself, byhis own choice. Thus a pioneer settled on a piece of landof his own choosing and made it into a farm through hisown effort. In those days an entire county might have onlya couple of hundred inhabitants and was a far more iso-lated and autonomous entity than a modern county is.Hence the pioneer farmer participated as a member of arelatively small group in the creation of a new, orderedcommunity. One may well question whether the creationof this community was an improvement, but at any rate itsatisfied the pioneer’s need for the power process.58. It would be possible to give other examples of so-cieties in which there has been rapid change and/or lackof close community ties without the kind of massive beha-vioral aberration that is seen in today’s industrial society.We contend that the most important cause of social andpsychological problems in modern society is the fact thatpeople have insufficient opportunity to go through the po-wer process in a normal way. We don’t mean to say thatmodern society is the only one in which the power processhas been disrupted. Probably most if not all civilized so-cieties have interfered with the power process to a greateror lesser extent. But in modern industrial society the pro-blem has become particularly acute. Leftism, at least in itsrecent (mid- to late-20th century) form, is in part a symp-tom of deprivation with respect to the power process.

#  THE MOTIVES OF SCIENTISTS 

 87. Science and technology provide the most importantexamples of surrogate activities. Some scientists claimthat they are motivated by “curiosity” or by a desire to “be-nefit humanity.” But it is easy to see that neither of thesecan be the principal motive of most scientists. As for “cu-riosity,” that notion is simply absurd. Most scientists workon highly specialized problems that are not the object ofany normal curiosity. For example, is an astronomer, a ma-thematician or an entomologist curious about the proper-ties of isopropyltrimethylmethane? Of course not. Only achemist is curious about such a thing, and he is curiousabout it only because chemistry is his surrogate activity.Is the chemist curious about the appropriate classificationof a new species of beetle? No. That question is of interestonly to the entomologist, and he is interested in it only be-cause entomology is his surrogate activity. If the chemistand the entomologist had to exert themselves seriously toobtain the physical necessities, and if that effort exerci-sed their abilities in an interesting way but in some nons-cientific pursuit, then they wouldn’t give a damn aboutisopropyltrimethylmethane or the classification of beetles.Suppose that lack of funds for postgraduate education hadled the chemist to become an insurance broker instead ofa chemist. In that case he would have been very interested  in insurance matters but would have cared nothing aboutisopropyltrimethylmethane. In any case it is not normal toput into the satisfaction of mere curiosity the amount oftime and effort that scientists put into their work. The “cu-riosity” explanation for the scientists’ motive just doesn’tstand up.88. The “benefit of humanity” explanation doesn’t workany better. Some scientific work has no conceivable rela-tion to the welfare of the human race most of archaeo-logy or comparative linguistics for example. Some otherareas of science present obviously dangerous possibilities.Yet scientists in these areas are just as enthusiastic abouttheir work as those who develop vaccines or study air pol-lution. Consider the case of Dr. Edward Teller, who hadan obvious emotional involvement in promoting nuclearpower plants. Did this involvement stem from a desireto benefit humanity? If so, then why didn’t Dr. Teller getemotional about other “humanitarian” causes? If he wassuch a humanitarian then why did he help to develop theH-bomb? As with many other scientific achievements, it isvery much open to question whether nuclear power plantsactually do benefit humanity. Does the cheap electricityoutweigh the accumulating waste and the risk of acci-dents? Dr. Teller saw only one side of the question. Clearlyhis emotional involvement with nuclear power arose notfrom a desire to “benefit humanity” but from a personalfulfillment he got from his work and from seeing it put topractical use.89. The same is true of scientists generally. With pos-sible rare exceptions, their motive is neither curiosity nora desire to benefit humanity but the need to go throughthe power process: to have a goal (a scientific problem tosolve), to make an effort (research) and to attain the goal(solution of the problem.) Science is a surrogate activitybecause scientists work mainly for the fulfillment they getout of the work itself.90. Of course, it’s not that simple. Other motives do playa role for many scientists. Money and status for example.Some scientists may be persons of the type who have aninsatiable drive for status (see paragraph 79) and this mayprovide much of the motivation for their work. No doubtthe majority of scientists, like the majority of the generalpopulation, are more or less susceptible to advertising andmarketing techniques and need money to satisfy their cra-ving for goods and services. Thus science is not a PUREsurrogate activity. But it is in large part a surrogate acti-vity.91. Also, science and technology constitute a powermass movement, and many scientists gratify their needfor power through identification with this mass movement(see paragraph 83).92. Thus science marches on blindly, without regardto the real welfare of the human race or to any otherstandard, obedient only to the psychological needs of thescientists and of the government of ficials and corporationexecutives who provide the funds for research 

#  THE NATURE OF FREEDOM 

 93. We are going to argue that industrial-technologicalsociety cannot be reformed in such a way as to prevent itfrom progressively narrowing the sphere of human free-dom. But, because “freedom” is a word that can be inter-preted in many ways, we must first make clear what kindof freedom we are concerned with.94. By “freedom” we mean the opportunity to gothrough the power process, with real goals not the artifi-cial goals of surrogate activities, and without interference,manipulation or supervision from anyone, especially fromany large organization. Freedom means being in control(either as an individual or as a member of a SMALL group)of the life-and-death issues of one’s existence: food, clo-thing, shelter and defense against whatever threats theremay be in one’s environment. Freedom means having po-wer; not the power to control other people but the powerto control the circumstances of one’s own life. One doesnot have freedom if anyone else (especially a large organi-zation) has power over one, no matter how benevolently,tolerantly and permissively that power may be exercised.It is important not to confuse freedom with mere permis-siveness (see paragraph 72).95. It is said that we live in a free society becausewe have a certain number of constitutionally guaranteedrights. But these are not as important as they seem. Thedegree of personal freedom that exists in a society is de-termined more by the economic and technological struc-ture of the society than by its laws or its form of govern-ment. \[16\] Most of the Indian nations of New Englandwere monarchies, and many of the cities of the ItalianRenaissance were controlled by dictators. But in readingabout these societies one gets the impression that they al-lowed far more personal freedom than our society does.In part this was because they lacked efficient mechanismsfor enforcing the ruler’s will: There were no modern, well-organized police forces, no rapid long-distance communi-cations, no surveillance cameras, no dossiers of informa-tion about the lives of average citizens. Hence it was rela-tively easy to evade control.96. As for our constitutional rights, consider forexample that of freedom of the press. We certainly don’tmean to knock that right; it is very important tool for li-miting concentration of political power and for keepingthose who do have political power in line by publicly ex-posing any misbehavior on their part. But freedom of thepress is of very little use to the average citizen as an in-dividual. The mass media are mostly under the controlof large organizations that are integrated into the system.Anyone who has a little money can have something prin-ted, or can distribute it on the Internet or in some suchway, but what he has to say will be swamped by the vastvolume of material put out by the media, hence it willhave no practical effect. To make an impression on societywith words is therefore almost impossible for most indivi-duals and small groups. Take us (FC) for example. If wehad never done anything violent and had submitted thepresent writings to a publisher, they probably would nothave been accepted. If they had been been accepted and  published, they probably would not have attracted manyreaders, because it’s more fun to watch the entertainmentput out by the media than to read a sober essay. Even ffthese writings had had many readers, most of these rea-ders would soon have forgotten what they had read astheir minds were flooded by the mass of material to whichthe media expose them. In order to get our message beforethe public with some chance of making a lasting impres-sion, we’ve had to kill people.97. Constitutional rights are useful up to a point, butthey do not serve to guarantee much more than whatmight be called the bourgeois conception of freedom. Ac-cording to the bourgeois conception, a “free” man is essen-tially an element of a social machine and has only a cer-tain set of prescribed and delimited freedoms; freedomsthat are designed to serve the needs of the social machinemore than those of the individual. Thus the bourgeois’s“free” man has economic freedom because that promotesgrowth and progress; he has freedom of the press becausepublic criticism restrains misbehavior by political leaders;he has a right to a fair trial because imprisonment at thewhim of the powerful would be bad for the system. Thiswas clearly the attitude of Simon Bolivar. To him, peopledeserved liberty only if they used it to promote progress(progress as conceived by the bourgeois). Other bourgeoisthinkers have taken a similar view of freedom as a meremeans to collective ends. Chester C. Tan, “Chinese Politi-cal Thought in the Twentieth Century,” page 202, explainsthe philosophy of the Kuomintang leader Hu Han-min:“An individual is granted rights because he is a memberof society and his community life requires such rights. Bycommunity Hu meant the whole society of the nation.”And on page 259 Tan states that according to CarsumChang (Chang Chun-mai, head of the State Socialist Partyin China) freedom had to be used in the interest of thestate and of the people as a whole. But what kind of free-dom does one have if one can use it only as someone elseprescribes? FC’s conception of freedom is not that of Bo-livar, Hu, Chang or other bourgeois theorists. The troublewith such theorists is that they have made the develop-ment and application of social theories their surrogate ac-tivity. Consequently the theories are designed to serve theneeds of the theorists more than the needs of any peoplewho may be unlucky enough to live in a society on whichthe theories are imposed.98. One more point to be made in this section: It shouldnot be assumed that a person has enough freedom justbecause he SAYS he has enough. Freedom is restricted inpart by psychological controls of which people are uncons-cious, and moreover many people’s ideas of what consti-tutes freedom are governed more by social conventionthan by their real needs. For example, it’s likely that manyleftists of the oversocialized type would say that mostpeople, including themselves, are socialized too little ra-ther than too much, yet the oversocialized leftist pays aheavy psychological price for his high level of socializa-tion.",/r/teenagers/comments/nscm3s/industrial_society_and_its_future_by_theodore/,1
55,nstls5,teenagers,Sat Jun  5 14:22:38 2021,Unreasonably stressed,"I've been finding myself so unreasonably stressed out. Around 3 weeks ago, I had gotten a job at a local Dunkin donuts, down the street from my towns mall. They were understaffed, and the whole reason I got the job was because two of my friends worked there. I got the interview, was hired right away, and put on the next week. I have just had to quit this morning without any notice because I simply can't handle the stress. I'm riding on D's in school, in almost every class, and my manager was putting me on both weekends every single weekend. I had to call out two Sundays in a row, because I can't mentally handle the exhaustion coming from working two 8 hour morning shifts at a dunkins both days on the weekend, it's fucking packed. It's a rush from when I get there until I leave, and I couldnt even take my break when I needed it, they just rotated people onto break, so I'd end up taking my break an hour and a half after coming in so I have to work for 6-7 hours straight with no break for as long as one of the supervisors or the manager is there.

Needless to say, after putting In a note last week, and telling my manager directly I need at least ONE day off on the weekend and seeing that my schedule this weekend was again, two 8 hour morning shifts, I've just texted my boss and told her I can't come in anymore. I understand it can take some time for schedule changes to go in, actually, next weekend I knew I had Saturday off, but next weekend doesn't matter. I have school, the same as everyone else, and with my grades being as low as they are and my school ending in no time at all, I NEEDED this weekend to catch up. I had been suspended and falling behind last week, so I absolutely needed this weekend to catch up, This was the one weekend I needed, just one day to work on school work and relax, and this fucking bitch couldn't fucking listen to the MULTIPLE times I had told her that the weekends are difficult for me because of how much time I used on the weekends for school and my mental health. 

My main problem now is, I'm just stressed out and feel bad. I was already very very stressed out before, even though my friends and others even younger than me have been able to work and hold a job for a year or longer, I just couldn't do it, everyday I came in and saw I was scheduled on both weekends my blood would boil, they never scheduled me when it was convenient(not that I expected them to), always when I wanted to make plans with people or had school work coming up, they managed to pinpoint every single day I needed(even week days) to take up my time.

 Guess what america? You don't need your fucking coffee that bad, get the fuck over it. Seriously. It's a fucking drug. Coffee is a drug, caffeine is a drug, and you people act like you need it SO FUCKING BAD. I was there for only 3 weeks and the amount of people I saw get genuinely fucking angry over a goddamn caramel latte having half an inch of air at the top BECAUSE WHEN YOU USE THE MACHINE FOR MILK, AND THE EXPRESSO MACHINE IN THE RIGHT SIZE, IT LEAVES ROOM FOR WHIPPED CREAM. THERES SPACE BECAUSE THERES USALLY WHIPPED CREAM. YOU WANT THAT SPACE FILLED, KAREN? FOR YOUR COFFEE? GET FUCKING WHIPPED CREAM, IM DOING MY JOB.

I'm feeling even more stressed out now that there's going to be some horrible consequence to just texting my boss on a Saturday morning I'm quitting when I was supposed to come in for 7, even though I also don't care in the slightest. I enjoyed working there to some extent, I enjoyed the people quite a lot, everyone in there was really great and easy to work with, I always found myself laughing on a shift no matter when or where, but I was also constantly thinking about work. When my next shift was, how long I had to work, how much sleep I'd be able to get or how much free time I would be able to have, I just hated having to do math constantly in my head or think strategically about my life so much, I just wanted to fucking relax. Since I started working there 3 weeks ago it was nonstop stress about school, work, friends, Everything, and I can't do that all summer or next year either, the money really is not worth being so stressed out all the time, not getting enough sleep, not eating enough, not enough time to simply decompress. I feel bad for just quitting without putting in a two weeks, and I'm wondering if I'm just a pussy because everyone in there was a teenager too trying to balance school and work. I do feel like a coward for quitting, that I wasn't strong enough, but I was simply just way too stressed out, and when my employer doesn't seem to be listening or even regarding that I have school too when no one else was working both weekends a lot of the time, it just seemed so unfair. I know I was still training technically, I know working weekends is a great way to get it down quick, I could do everything fine! Could work any station relatively easily, but I just felt my time was being abused.

Am I wrong at all in feeling like this? I understand how leaving without notice could be wrong, and that's what I feel worst about, but I needed this weekend to catch up on school as that's so much more of an important obligation, but now I'm feeling stressed that I don't have a job anymore, and all of that time I've put in learning is useless outside of the cash I had gotten from the paychecks. I just simply wanted to relax and get school work done, I have no idea why teenagers are expected to take on so many responsibilities because do adults have to balance school, work, and their social representation and standing? Not as much as teenagers, because we have to manage and get good grades in school, if we get a job we have to manage that, we HAVE to manage our social standing, as socialization I feel is vital happiness. Adults, they don't have school, their job is something they went to school for, or chose, it usually isn't fucking fast food, and their social standing is better, because they already have and developed good friends and don't have to worry about social media, or every detail of the things they do getting out. I understand there bills, owning a house, managing children, etc, is stressful and expensive, but you've also had a lifetime to learn, I've had 16 years, 12 of which were spent without much stress, so forgive me for feeling stressed out.

Tldr: I quit my job because I'm stressed, and now I'm stressed that I quit my job. Also, fuck adults for downplaying teenager's problems.",/r/teenagers/comments/nstls5/unreasonably_stressed/,7
71,ntagb0,teenagers,Sun Jun  6 04:28:19 2021,anyone else not watch the media anymore?,"Like it's genuinely disturbing how much both the liberal AND conservative stations just try to stir up violence among people. I think the pandemic has really contributed to the rise of violence (some of the BLM protests, Capitol riots) because when people are locked in all day, they use the news as their window to the outside world. I'd go as far to say that the news is probably one of the biggest reasons why extremism seems to be a lot more common these days.

I seriously started to develop racist &amp; homophobic views because I wasn't able to make any real world comparisons to what things like FOX told me. For months, I actually believed that all blacks were violent idiots &amp; all transgender people were lunatics who cut their dick or tits off.

Now that things have almost entirely gotten back to normal at this point, I don't know what the hell was wrong with me. Like, I legit said to myself on the first day of in-person school: ""Y'know, black people are actually kinda alright."" Shit like that. Basically, I realized that I was a fucking idiot for falling into that dumb trap. It happened to some of my buddies, too. For example, one of my friends (who is of Vietnamese descent) even told me that while violence against Asian-Americans is a real problem, he felt angry because all of the #StopAsianHate stuff just seemed to make the amount of crimes against people like him increase.

Anyways, I guess what I'm trying to say is that the media makes things look a lot worse than they really are. I know they've always been like this, but with COVID it really screwed a lot of people up. I know the world isn't perfect &amp; there's a shit ton of issues to deal with, but stations like CNN, FOX, NBC, etc are just undoing all of the actual progress we've made.",/r/teenagers/comments/ntagb0/anyone_else_not_watch_the_media_anymore/,3

Honestly, this probably shouldn't bother me so much, but I'm just venting about it because it's a weird new feeling of regret.
I sat down, ready for this boring-ass test, and there's a cute girl sitting next to me. We make eye contact, and then a little more, and for some reason I can just feel that there's a vibe here, even though I have the social perception of a lawnmower. Never before have I felt such a vibe, and it's just impossible to explain, BUT IT WAS THERE. Eventually it's the break, and I flounder a little but we start talking and it goes pretty well, I can still feel the vibe. Test continues, we both finish each section early and are, again, vibing. Then, the test ends, and we're leaving, and I kind of just, don't... The vibe was still there, but I fucking do nothing.
It's probably really stupid, and feel free to tell me if it's stupid, but I just can't help but think ""what if"" and I just wish I had full sent that shit. It was probably the first time I had felt such a vibe and I didn't capitalize on it and I am just full of regret.... So dumb.

Sections 1: early life. 

You may know Elon musk as starting off poor, getting rich by himself. This is *false*. His parents were middle class, this quora post says 
""Relative wealth compared to other South Africans yes, relative wealth compared to Americans at the time no, modest comfort yes. Elon Musk was born into privilege because he was white and born into South Africa’s apartheid system. But he also got bullied in school for being a nerd to the point where he almost died and ended up in the hospital. His family lived well and could vacation, probably like someone making 100–150k in the US (outside an expensive major metro area in the US) now. But he wasn’t born into the same class of wealth that a young Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerburg were""

Section 2: early success.

Elon musk's first big success was zip2, i believe it was basically an internet phone ok, but i am not sure. At this point, i don't believe he had any bad intentions. This was sold to Compaq for $307 USD. This site seems to have a lot of information. https://www.sitebuilderreport.com/origin-stories/elon-musk


Section 3: personal life

It is said that Elon musk is a jerk and is rude. This may or may not be true, but the signs point to yes. In an article it says (quoting directly) ""Less than a decade after being essentially homeless in Canada, Elon was now Silicon Valley’s latest rich guy. It’s here we see the first signs of Elon potentially turning into a jerk. He purchased one of only 62 McLarens (really expensive car) in the world. He drove it around so much in the Valley that he started to get a dick reputation""  and  ""At SpaceX Elon quickly gained a reputation as a staunch leader. One employee said  “If Elon was not happy, you knew it. Things could get nasty.” Even one of SpaceX’s greatest employees, Steve Davis, experienced Elon’s lack of caring. Davis was once assigned a task that seemed so impossible that another engineer said, ‘any other engineer at any other aerospace company would never have even attempted’. The assignment was to take a part that was quoted for $120,000 and built it on Elon’s proposed budget of $5,000. Davis spent nine months and poured his life into it. In the end, he was able to able to make it for only $3,900! Davis sent Elon an email detailing his greatest accomplishment to which Elon simply replied ‘Ok.’""

Trump is secretly a scaly and one day while he was wearing his snake suit he tricked Eve and told her to eat the apple. He also killed Abel. He also lead the Mongol invasions of everywhere. And the Hun invasions. And the Mughal invasions of India. And the Viking invasions.Trump was the guy who started colonialism(only the invading part not the part where they provided technology and medicine to the natives). After Trump tested positive for Covid19, he spit on Native Americans, nearly driving them extinct. Trump also killed all the dinosaurs. He was also behind the Bronze age collapse. Trump single-handedly did the Triangular Slave Trade; hell he was the guy Trump bought the slaves from. Trump also beheaded a French teacher for disrespecting Mohammad, and blamed it on wholesome Muslimerinos. All the blood diamonds are produced by Trump. He was the guy who cut Congolese workers hands off because they did not meet his supply. Trump chased Kyyle Rittenhouse in Kenosha with a skateboard and beat him up and snatched his rifle, and used it to kill Jacob Blake.

During the Russian Revolution, the peasants understood that Nikolai II's family was innocent, and would offer them a chance to leave, but Trump massacred them. Trump tried his best but failed in preventing the American and French Revolutions, but he got back at them by causing the Reign of Terror. Trump tortured Louis XVI's son and forced him into saying that he had sex with his mother and aunt, and promptly guillotined them. Trump invented pineapple-pizza and Tofu-Chicken. He was the guy who snitched on Alan Turing, revealing that he was gay. The judge felt that such a respected professor could be sent away with a slap on the wrist, but Trump rigged the jury and sentenced him to hormonal therapy.

I wish I could go back in time and fuck Hitler’s brains out.","This is how I envision it: I’m a dirty little american soldier that ends up being captured by the Nazis. To avoid execution, I volunteer myself to be Hitler’s obedient fuck-toy.

For days, I allow Hitler to chain me up and obliterate all of my orifices like they’re little Polands, constantly filling them with his aryan seed until his cock is stroked raw.

Hell, he even gives me the pleasure to lick his puckered german booty clean after he takes insane nuclear shits. Due to me not getting bathroom access, I constantly shit and piss myself, but Hitler is generous enough to be my personal cleanup, licking it all up and staining his beautiful mustache.

After building up trust and showing my obedience, he unchains me and allows me to fuck his brains out, cursing in pleasure as he yells out, “YA SHOVE IT REICH UP MY ASS!”. I’m generous enough to give him a reach around, cranking his throbbing war machine.

I feel him tighten up as he reaches climax, but I let go of his thick ramrod as he begins to spew his nuclear ejaculate all over the floor. Hitler repeatedly yells out “NEIN! NEIN! NEIN! NEIN!” through his moans while he suffers through his ruined orgasm. At this point the tables have turned.

He tries to fight me off, but I pin him down and powerfully thrust my all-american cock harder into his poop chute as blood begins to build up and gush out of his torn asshole. I can’t contain myself any longer, so I quickly pull out my 1911 and put a bullet through the back of Hitler’s head. Brain matter and skull fragments paint the wall, which makes me break through to my climax.

I raise my right arm up to the ceiling. I yell out “SEIG HEIL!” as my cock begins to rapidly pulsate. I quickly thrust my cock to the hilt deep inside of him. I throw my head back with a loud “FUUUUCK!” as I spew what feels like a gallon of american semen deep inside his german asshole.

I pull my bloody cock out of his booty tube and watch in excitement as my thick load begins to leak out of his ass. Heavily breathing, I fall back and begin to fade out, as I watch a group of american soldiers burst into the room, guns drawn.

I wake up in the hospital, in which I’m told that I’m praised as an american hero for stopping World War 2.",/r/teenagers/comments/nuan0h/fuck_it_im_just_gonna_say_it_i_wish_i_could_go/,16

96,nvkk50,teenagers,Wed Jun  9 05:00:35 2021,TIFU by dating my girlfriend at Disneyland and the getting caught by a bald cop who works for the FBI. AITA?,"Hi, my name is Maximilien Tora Viden Paul de Avestruz da Silva  (79M) and I hate the authorities of America.


Recently, I've been arrested by the FBI. I'm setenced to 29 years in prison. That's why I hate the United States Of America, or (as you may know it) USA. Ok, but you need all the context first (that's important).


For the past 5 years, I (used to)have been dating a gorgeous japanese woman named Enorokim(currently 92F)(although I first met her when she was 57, on january 3rd 2016). She's the perfect woman: she is pretty, cute and has small breasts. But that's not all, she shines on her personality: likes shitposting and a lot of funny memes like the Kingdom Cum and the shitting toothpaste. One thing that is very unique to her is the fact that she likes to cosplay as a dog (a adorable puppy, may i say) that loves videogames, rip and tear, and purple cats.


Then we decided to travel to the ""freedom"" country, the USA. I was at Disney Land while sharing a cotton candy with her, walking on the park and chilling. And then Enorokim said ""I'm hungry"", so i said ""Let's go eat"". And then a very tall bald guy in a police suit grabbed my shoulder and said ""I've been secretely following you because the girl looks young"". I was surprised by him following us, but my girlfriend does indeed look young, so I just said ""Bruh, she's 92"". He said ""I don't believe in you, give me her ID"". I was like ""BRUHH?"", who in the world wouldn't trust the girl's boyfriend at Disneyland? 


But, well, ANYWAYS, I showed him Enorokim's ID and he said ""You have the right to remain silent. You are being arrested under accusations of pedophilia"". What the fuck? How dumb can he be? Why? I'm not a pedo. Then I said the obvious (what should be common sense to everyone) to him: ""it's okay because she cosplays as dog and is legal in dog years, you big piece of shit"".


He said ""you shall remain silent"". And then i ran (I didn't get shot because I said to him that shooting people is gay, and he was an homophobe[I knew it because he had a t-shirt from an anti-jojo movement]), leaving everything behind. And then, by a fat hit of luck, I found a guy that looked just like me, so I did what any sensible person would do: hid from the cop, waited, grabbed a knife, stabbed the guy and started to pretend to be him.


But when I said ""pretend to be him"", I really meant it: that night I got his name by his ID, doxxed him and found his house and blended in with his family. I'm so good at this that they didn't even notice. Although his kid said ""mom, why dad sus?"" but I hid all evidence that I destroyed his Among Us toy (sorry, this is rare symptom of a  chronic disease i have, AMOGUS-19), so I'm safe .


But the thing is, the guy was an astronaut and idk shit about space. But I hopped in his mission anyways, you just have to launch and maintain a ship in space. How hard could that be?


A few minutes before the launch I noticed something: one of the astronauts (brown) was a shitphobe (I knew that because he was wearing a t-shirt from an anti-""The Promised Neverland 2"" movement). So I had a plan: make all the crewmates shit their pants to scare the shit out of him.


So, first I did the admin card task, It's pretty hard but I quickly got the handle of it (you just gotta pass the card at just the right speed). After, I did navigation. And finally, I sabotaged lights.


All the crewmates were in one place, fixing lights, except for yellow, brown, and black that were on the cafeteria. So i grabbed my phone and typed ""The Brown Note"" on YouTube, it's basically a magic song that does stuff (I learned about it by my idol, Eric Cartman, a role model for me). So I busted the song very loudly (PS: i was using  an anti-sound headset) and the song worked: all of them shat their pants. I vented to security.


Brown, attracted by a very distinct smell of feces, came and killed all of the  poor pant-shat souls (as the shitphobe that he is). We did an emergency meeting and he voted black off (because brown's a white cop, duh)(yellow and me were AFK, so only brown actually voted).


Everyone (but me) was happy because the ""impostor"" was gone and no one was considered ""sus"". So we decided to take a cup of coffee. I said ""I'll prepare our coffee"". And then I put a shitton of laxatives on their cups.

 Everyone took a sip. BUT THEN, i felt WEIRD. My body started to make strange noises and it felt like there was a massive ball of stuff running around in my intestines at the speed of light. I thought I mixed our cups by accident.


I was like ""NO NO NO I CAN'T SHIT MYSELF RN"". I just needed yellow to shit himself first, but he had a notoriously slow metabolism. My poop was kicking the door, I was feeling the despair of being shot in the head by myself.


But THEN, yellow said ""is it just me or is it very hot?"". I was like ""YES YES YES"". Hot sensation is a side effect of the laxative. I just needed to last around 65 seconds more.


So I grabbed a stopper and stuck it inside by ass. Waited around a minute and yellow shat himself, brown killed him.


There it was, just me and brown. But UH OH, I can't last any longer, so i quickly aimed my butt at browns head and took the stopper off. It was a stream of poop. The pressure was so intense that it killed brown in the process. Finally, sweet revenge!


But there was problem... I couldn't stop pooping, it was like... ifinite poop...! The ship quickly became 100% full of poop, after 8472691 miliseconds, it exploded. 


I was flying in space, in Earth's direction, as a shit-proppeled rocket. After 53 days, I was entering Earth's atmosphere, I fell at the house of the president of the United States, killing his family. Then he used his powers to summon 63 FBI 
agents. 


Turns out everything was staged, the original cop didn't actually die and knew who I was all along. It was all a plan to make me kill a fake version of the president's family and therefore have a reason to extend my time in prison by accusing me of something I didn't actually do.


I was setenced to 69 years on a prison in Lodon, USA's most secure state. But, just before accepting my fate, i grabbed his phone and made this post.


AITA for stealing a cop's phone?",/r/teenagers/comments/nvkk50/tifu_by_dating_my_girlfriend_at_disneyland_and/,8
89,nw4lxk,teenagers,Wed Jun  9 22:48:37 2021,"I’m being falsely accused of harassment, I have evidence that I didn’t do it and they aren’t..looking at it","So there was this girl that I was friends with. We had an argument a while ago and basically haven’t been friends since then and haven’t talked for weeks, remember that. (Sorry if this story is long btw). 

A friend of mine didn’t know much about the situation and asked her why we aren’t talking anymore and I later realised she called me a “bad person”. Well last night, I saw an Instagram notification appear of a message saying “if you want to say something, say it to my face instead of getting other people to do it for you”. Of course, I got angry and sent her 3 messages. The messages I sent her were all at once, not over time. 

Anyway, the next day (today), I had a creative media exam. She walked over from the other side of the classroom to my desk when I was working at my computer, I turned quickly expecting it to be a teacher when I heard “stand outside now I’m gonna speak to you”. When you imagine that in your head, just imagine it being a teachers voice after you’ve been in trouble, in a stern, stiff but loud voice. I was taken aback but of course I didn’t start yelling..yet. I told her I was doing an exam (it was a normal creative media lesson but an extended lesson so everyone called it an exam). She started to get louder this time saying things like “get tf outside now I’m gonna speak to you, pussy”. At this point I’m like bitch I’m in an important exam and you’re wondering why I don’t want to talk to you?? Anyways she was the pussy considering she needed her friend to amp her up to be with her. 

When she started to actually insult me and get that angry, it was almost upsetting. Not out of fear, but out of how i was essentially still grieving over our friendship being over. We were  closest that people and even teachers would think we were “a thing”. I miss wheezing with her laughing at our inside jokes in Spanish and having lunch with her. This time I was yelling at her back calling her a few bad words. Eventually the entire glass was quiet and staring at the both of us. It didn’t make it better when I walked out screaming something along the lines of “f*cking bitch always starting sh*t for no reason”. It’s a borderline thing. I cannot control myself when people speak to me like that. I got even more angry when the 6’5 teacher tried to stand in the way to stop me leaving. This girl was still screaming at me from the classroom. This time I was in the hallway.

From here, the only fair or kindness at the bare minimum from a teacher was an assistant. She calmed me down and just made me feel better. She let me to a teacher to talk about what happened. What happened from here was that I was made to complete my exam in a separate room. Of course I was upset and my friends, cos they are just the best, gave me a hug.

At the end of the day I was called to a teachers office who was the head of year (grade if ur American). Another assistant teacher told me to place my phone on her desk for her to search it as we waited for her to arrive. And for her to search it, I was fine with that, my attitude was “go ahead because you’ll see that I haven’t got anything worth punishment in there but go of ig”. After a minute or so of waiting, she arrived.

She told me that I had been harassing her online and that I had been sending people to ask her question. Firstly, I had not May, f*cking MAY! Once again, MY PHONE WAS ON HER DESK IN FRONT OF HER! But noooo she just had to trust her word without literally checking the chats.

Secondly, i had not at all sent anyone to “ask her questions” and I could prove that, but not this day because of course the person that asked her had to be off. If she were in, she would literally be so easily able to say “no, he did not ask me to ask her anything”. So both of them were so easily to disprove.

At some point, this teacher explained that I have been saying horrible things to her recently. As I said, we haven’t talked from May. She was apparently shown screenshots of me saying “Horrible things to her”. Now here I don’t blame this teacher too much considering that, out of context, they indeed appeared to be this way. This girl and I often made dark jokes both as bad as each other (bet you can see where this was going). What I’m assuming happened is that she showed her screenshots and only screenshots (because that’s what the teacher said she said) and these were most definitely taken out of context. Her and I never made jokes that we were uncomfortable with, she’d make jokes about my self harm and I’d make jokes about her background and we were both openly okay with it. 

At some point, I must have made jokes about her being in a hijab because this is the only time I said anything to her about Islam. Some context, this chic doesn’t know her dad (her Muslim side), lives only with her mum (who’s white Christian) and she is..well...literally not a Muslim. The thing is, I don’t even think she was offended at the time, I think she just brought it up as if it recently happened which it didn’t because it was literally months ago. Back to the point, she often says quite islamophobic things (which I have screenshots on). 

Basically the teacher said at some point “also who are you to tell her she shouldn’t wear a hijab?”. Dude, she kept asking if she should wear a hijab. I said that it would be weird considering she is nowhere near religious because she’d literally told me that, especially to the religion islam and is so open about making isis jokes about Muslim people in our schools. I’m not sorry, if you ask me for my opinion on your outfit and get offended if I would say it would be weird then just don’t ask me. Also I understand that part has made me sound quite not friendly to Muslims. To Muslims out there, you do you, if you aren’t hurting anyone (that goes for any religion btw) then I am in full support of you believing what you want to believe and I also love people of all religions and cultures ❤️❤️❤️.

After sitting there for a minute, the teacher asked if I’d like to have her in the room so we could get closure but even though I kept saying “no I am not comfortable with that” she still brought her into the room so I don’t get her point in asking. 

Despite me repeatedly telling her that i wasn’t sending anymore to ask her things nor was I “harassing her” she sort of heard that then had the audacity to shrug then turn to her and say “now if he messages you any more I want you to come straight to me” as if I was messaging her...I kept on telling her to check my phone. Despite it being in front of her, she didn’t. She just ignored me saying “check my phone, check my phone, check my phone”. And then she threatened to suspend me saying “now if you maintain this I will not hesitate to exclude you” for f*cking what!!!!!!!??&amp;?7:£:956) and the other teacher who was there was like “now we could actually get you arrested”. Let’s just say I was on the edge.

The anger I felt from how ignored I was immeasurable. I felt like I was screaming at the top of my lungs and still being threatened. “We can get you arrested for harassment”, bish where?? For when she messaged me out of nowhere, for when she came up to my face in the middle of an exam calling me a pussy, or for when she was harassing ME online?!! 

Needless to say, after I showed my mum the messages and explained everything, she was furious. She called the school up when I got home (I was sent home three hours early). My mother with her inner Scandinavian was truly tearing a new one on this b*tch. At some point, this teacher had the audacity to say “I did not threaten to suspend your son”. Okay so is it not a threat when someone says “If I get any more reports like this once again I will not hesitate to suspend you”?.

Nevertheless, this was a rant. This has been such a bad day especially towards my very last year at this school. I am just so furious towards those people. I cannot believe that our friendship has done a dua lipa and did a full 180 because wow we were close as close could be. I’d consider being upset over that, but this just goes so show that some friendships fail. 

TLDR: A friend who I fell out with accused me of online harassment and bullying when we have not talked since March. However the teachers had no issue blindly believing her.

5,ny7jhj,teenagers,Sat Jun 12 17:07:06 2021,Hey I've noticed something,"When being directly transphobic, transphobes are always targeting trans women, saying they are predators, that they just wanna see your daughters naked, that they are just men in skirt etc

However when on the topic of trans men, transphobes often make them out to be the victims of some great peer pressure, saying that they were pressured into being trans and they thought they felt the dysphoria because they had dysmorphia from periods.

Just a thing I'd noticed. 

Now time for me to attack these points.

I imagine 1 in 10000 people who say they're trans MtF are just doing it to attack women, making it a proportion of about a 1000-1 ratio of cis women sexual assaulters to trans women sexual assaulters. Reminder that trans people make up 2% of the adolescent population in america (13-20). 

Its not a case of men using womens bathrooms, its a case of being accepting of trans women. 

Trans men are ***almost never*** pressured into being trans, and groups like PragerU try to make it out as if schools just go ""oh you don't feel comfortable as a girl? TAKE THIS TESTOSTERONE YOU ARE NOW A MANLY MAN"". I don't know how many times i can reiterate that it doesn't work like that. The vast majority of trans men experience post transition dysphoria - the feeling of invalidity, this does not mean they should be treated to be a detransitioner.

When people say that ""a lot of trans people regret it later"" they are wrong. Only 8% of people detransition and about 90% of the 8% transition to another gender later on. Its literally a 0.4% rate of detransition over all.

Super straight: super straight is extremely controversial, and likely comes from a person who has a warped sense of what a trans woman is. 

Before i say anything on superstraight i want to mention, it is *completely fine* to turn down a trans person, doesn't mean you're transphobic just as much as it wouldn't be homophobic to turn down a gay person. 

A lot of trans women look almost identical to cis women, and most people wouldn't be able to tell the difference. Same goes but more so for trans men.

***what is transphobic is to say that under no circumstances would you date a trans person, solely for the reason of their being trans.*** trans people come in all shapes and sizes, just like cis people. The transphobic part would be seeing someone who is literally the same as a cis person in every way outside of chromosomes, which are inconceivable, and turning them down solely because they used to be a gender you aren't attracted to, and not because you find them as a person unattractive. In short, if you reject a trans person and you wouldn't have if they were cis and had exactly the same appearance, biology and sexual performance, then it is transphobic

Which makes me wonder why do most Indians have this sort of inferiority complex towards their social system/ regarding women safety? its because they take that seriously. Here in west its easy to pull out gross (in total) data about women safety in devloping nations compare it to ours and then shun allegations on inactivity of authorities based on them.

Currently Japan is leading in creating climate-friendly technologies as part of there kyoto protocol. This will not only reduce the internal carbon emissions of Japan but also help it reduce all over the world. 
They have ZERO protests of students bunking school   so that somehow climate will become okay or people crying ""companies are evil"" ""end capitalism"" or some shit like that while contributing 0% to actually doing something about it also they dont have politicians running agendas based on their personal interests or interests of their billion dollar companies allies. There is 0 polarisation.

48,nyr1ov,teenagers,Sun Jun 13 10:19:37 2021,I’m proud of Gen Z,"I’m coming in here as a recently 30 millennial. I am so proud of how y’all fight for social justice and are making an effort to educate yourselves on the problems modern society faces. I always like to think I was a pretty liberal person, but I compare who I was when I was a teenager to the teens of today, and it’s nowhere close. I feel like the liberal people of each generation has laid the groundwork for the following one to further social progress in the world, and each new generation paves the roadway further. I think of all the generations Gen Z has put the most effort into laying the groundwork early. 

We all know teenagers are one of the largest demographics to advertise and sell products to. Watching the change in modern media within recent years is astounding. I feel like I can watch a movie from the year 2000 and 1980 and they will have the same problematic content, racism, sexism, homophobia, etc. Watching content from 2018 to present day has seen a drastic shift. Shows like Big Mouth and Sex Education are not only popular, they have a much healthier expression of sexuality than movies/shows of the past. You want to know some of the most  sexually formative movies was for me as a kid? American Pie, Eurotrip, The Girl Next Door. I don’t know if any of you have seen these movies, but they are all extremely problematic.

I know that us millennials helped pave the way for this kind of media, but Gen Z has been so much more accepting of the sexual spectrum it has propelled progress tremendously. I never really knew what residential schools were as a kid, or how bad police violence was towards minorities. I didn’t think about how the vast majority of murder victims are women. Y’all have been holding people accountable and while I still wish you gave some of us millennials a bit of slack, I’m so proud of the fight you have in you.

48,nz677x,teenagers,Mon Jun 14 00:15:26 2021,I've had enough amogus memes!!!,"I've already had enough of the damn amongst us memes. Imagine the situation you're sitting in class and suddenly one of your colleagues decides to draw this damn crewmate on the whiteboard, well I don't need to imagine anything since this happened to me. I got up from my chair angry as fuck ready to punch this bitch in the face but suddenly got overwhelmed by my urges. I drew a dick on the amongst us dude and started laughing maniacally ""KINDA SUSSY INIT"" were the only words that I could squeeze out of my now collapsed windpipe. While shaking on the ground and coughing out ""SUSSY"" in morse code I managed to paint the unfinished drawing of the crewmate with the blood coming out of my wrist which I sliced with the whiteboard marker. Everyone looked in horror as the teacher made a futile attempt to stop the bleeding, it was already too late. I started cumming uncontrollably since my teach was a hot 10/10 and I hadn't touched a woman in years. The sheer pressure of cum pushed my underwear to its breaking point and broke through shooting the teacher in the face and instantly killing her. The stream of cum broke through the roof and was now flying towards the sun at 8 times the speed of light. Being me I managed to calculate that we had 1 minute remaining before the cum hit the sun and destroyed it and then another 8 minutes before we could actually observe this happen. I hadn't one thing into consideration though, since my cum was faster than light it travelled back in time and struck my classmate before she managed to draw this damn amongst us character on the whiteboard. She died instantly, but it was a small price to pay for the lives of everyone on planet Earth.

Crisis averted I thought, when suddenly the Space Force burst through the door. Apparently the Americans had already found out I invented time travel with the power of cum. I took the severed hand of my colleague and jerked myself off with it to shoot myself even farther back in time. The cum burst through my pants and killed everyone in the room whilst sending me back in time. I looked at the date, it was September 11th 2001. I knew I had some time left before the Americans came back, they had to organize the terrorist attacks after all. It was then that I got the idea. I'd go back in time and make America lose the war against the UK. I jerked off once again and went back to the year 1775. With the power of my cum I assisted Elizabeth II (she has always ruled the UK) in defeating Americans in the Revolutionary War. Like an anime swordsman, all it took was one nut and the entire army was gone, I knew I had won. I sent myself back to the present where I was treated like a national hero, I had saved the entire world, hot girls flooding in from everywhere, but I knew I couldn't nut anymore. It was too dangerous. I had to run away from Earth, my last nut on this planet sent me into space while simultaneously impregnating every woman in a 25 mile radius.

I'm gonna share you moments where teachers said false information in the classroom, where they gave awful life advice why my 6th grade art teacher was counterproductive on making students like art

1.-  The sun doesn't rotate.

I was in 1st grade, and my teacher was explaining the heliocentric model. A classmate asked if the sun rotates too and my teacher directly said no and gave a dumb ass explanation of why.

2.- Talking Angela and simsimi:

My teacher was explaining about mallicious people on the internet, and to ilustrate her point she searched for a supposed informative video. The video was actually a creepypasta from an entertainment channel.

The actual things that happened were: talking angela was never used by kidnappers, it never asked personal information, simsimi kids edition doesn't exist, simsimi doesn't encourage suicide and simsimi isn't used by the mafia to induce children to be hitmen.

3.- The tale of the Farmer and the golden eggs chicken

Basically the Farmer kills the chicken to have more eggs but he doesn't have any golden eggs afterwards. The moral of this story (According to the teachers) was along the line of ""Don't have ambition whatsoever"" Good luck with jobs being a conformist.

4.- Weekly minutes totally wasted

On fridays we had Self learning class, which would be a great way of teaching us to investigate, use excel and so, if only they did that. The only thing we did there is do the 4 hours of communications class we did the previous days of the week in 80 minutes. AGAIN. In a totally repetitive way with the only difference that this time we were on computer and we did not need a teacher. This is a way of telling the class that 4 hours of their life where wasted on unnecesary class minutes, and those 80 minutes that could be used to have another class where wasted on doing the same thing again. We lost 256 hours on this.

5.- The art class from 6th grade

Let's read one of the requirements to pass the art class ""The student learns about how art can be a great way to spend their time and relief stress"". Well, we have a great problem, because the art teacher was awful at this. First, she made art a complete chore, if you did not do ""proper"" pointillism you could not take the recess. Second, when she accidentaly made to fall the painting of the art club she expected them to pick it up. Third, we had no voting on the theatre class script, and it was written with a lot (And I mean A LOT) of spelling mistakes.

I cannot imagine how it would be on other schools of banana republic. Honestly this are puntual moments and in no way the norm, so I think it's not so fucked up, but still worse than the american education system.",/r/teenagers/comments/nztoqc/be_thankful_of_the_american_education_system_here/,10
66,o1fxc1,teenagers,Thu Jun 17 00:23:44 2021,I want to talk about sexual assault.,"This is an educational (I hope ) post. But it deals with the topic of sexual assault and is potentially triggering, please don’t read this if you don’t feel able to and look after yourself.

So I commented on a post earlier about how reporting a sexual assault isn’t easy. And I got downvoted. 

I’ve seen it a bit in this group but I want to educate people a bit, because I don’t like some people’s attitudes in the group towards the subject. Where I’m from (U.K.) a recent revelation has been made by a group called everyone’s invited. It talks about how prevalent rape culture is in schools. It’s very prevalent. Often with students themselves being perpetrators. 

So I want to educate people a bit, from the point of view as a victim. This isn’t meant to shame anyone. It’s to inform people of the problem and hopefully educate people on how bad the problem is and what they can do to help. 

1. Not every assault is committed by a stranger. Actually most assaults are committed by a person the victim knows for example a family member, friend or a significant other. 

2. Where I live there is a 1.7% conviction rate of cases that make it to court. That’s about 800 cases out of 52,000 reported. And the punishments aren’t that severe, for example Brock Turner. 

3. Reporting isn’t as easy as people make it out to be. Most people don’t get believed and victims are treated like the criminal. Their phones get taken off them and searched to see if they have had contact with their attacker. Reporting often re-traumatises the victim.

4. Telling a victim to report to save other people. This is the most guilting thing you can say to a victim. Not everyone is mentally strong enough to go through the harrowing process of reporting and that’s okay. The responsibility of the abusers behaviour SHOULD NEVER be with the victim. They cannot control the behaviour of another. Not reporting is not selfish or wanting them to get away. Some people don’t have the strength and that is 100% okay. 

5. People staying friends with the abuser. This is a big one. People can be aware of their behaviour and still be friends with them which is harmful. Actively still supporting someone who you know for certain is an abuser is actively perpetuating rape culture. The victim loses their friends but the abuser often loses nothing. 

6. Rape culture in schools is a big problem. Girls shoulders and outfits for example in America and the verbal abuse and groping girls experience too. It’s disgusting. Every sexist joke, every catcall, every stare, every ‘hot list’ every nude exchanged in a group chat (this is a punishable crime) and every groping is rape culture. Some are actually assaults and crimes. Don’t do it. 

7. Don’t be complicit. This one is mostly aimed at the boys (sorry) however girls if you feel safe to or you see a girl doing it then please say something. I’m not getting into why girls might not say something. Look up the story of the girl who was stabbed in the back in an American school for turning down a boy. Not saying something when you see someone do any of the things listed above is perpetuating rape culture. You are being complicit. And with something like this being complicit is almost as bad as actively participating. 

This wasn’t an attack on anyone. I just wanted to educate people on a serious problem. I didn’t specify a gender (apart form the end). Just take on board what I’ve said, speak the the women/girls in your life and get educated. 

It’s a problem. Even if you don’t see it or it doesn’t affect you.",/r/teenagers/comments/o1fxc1/i_want_to_talk_about_sexual_assault/,24

First off, no we do not all suck. I know men have done a LOT of shitty stuff in the past, and still now, and it is a problem. However, that does not give anyone an excuse to say we all suck. It’s sexism, just towards men instead. It annoys me, cuz a lot of people don’t seem to realize this. SO MANY people on the internet are just being sexist against men, when that’s not the way it should go. It shouldn’t go AT ALL. Every human is born equal. No matter race, gender, or sexual orientation. It’s like if a white man is discriminatory to an African American man, he’ll be singled out for his racism, however there was a post online I read (tried to find it, couldn’t) that said if a black person was racist against a white man, that was fine. No form of racism or sexism is fine! From any person against any race or gender! There are BILLIONS of men .who are good people!

78,o3d581,teenagers,Sat Jun 19 13:33:48 2021,Just a chunk of the Communist Manifesto,"**I. BOURGEOIS AND PROLETARIANS**

The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles.

Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary re-constitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.

In the earlier epochs of history, we find almost every¬ where a complicated arrangement of society into various orders, a manifold gradation of social rank. In ancient Rome we have patricians, knights, plebeians, slaves; in the Middle Ages, feudal lords, vassals, guild-masters, journeymen, apprentices, serfs; in almost all of these classes, again, subordinate gradations.

The modem bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms. It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones.

Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinctive feature: it has simplified the class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other: Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.

From the serfs of the Middle Ages sprang the chartered burghers of the earliest towns. From these burgesses the first elements of the bourgeoisie were developed.

The discovery of America, the rounding of the Cape, opened up fresh ground for the rising bourgeoisie. The East- Indian and Chinese markets, the colonisation of America, trade with the colonies, the increase in the means of ex¬ change and in commodities generally, gave to commerce, to navigation, to industry, an impulse never before known, and thereby, to the revolutionary element in the tottering feudal society, a rapid development.

The feudal system of industry, under which industrial production was monopolised by closed guilds, now no longer sufficed for the growing wants of the new markets. The manufacturing system took its place. The guild-masters were pushed on one side by the manufacturing middle class; division of labour between the different corporate guilds vanished in the face of division of labour in each single workshop.

Meantime the markets kept ever growing, the demand ever rising. Even manufacture no longer sufficed. Thereupon, steam and machinery revolutionised industrial production. The place of manufacture was taken by the giant, Modem Industry, the place of the industrial middle class, by industrial millionaires, the leaders of whole industrial armies, the modern bourgeois.

Modem industry has established the world market, for which the discovery of America paved the way. This market has given an immense development to commerce, to navigation, to communication by land. This development has, in its turn, reacted on the extension of industry; and in proportion as industry, commerce, navigation, railways extended, in the same proportion the bourgeoisie developed, increased its capital, and pushed into the background every class handed down from the Middle Ages.

We see, therefore, how the modern bourgeoisie is itself the product of a long course of development, of a series of revolutions in the modes of production and of exchange.

Each step in the development of the bourgeoisie was accompanied by a corresponding political advance of that class. An oppressed class under the sway of the feudal nobility, an armed and self-governing association in the medieval communed; here independent urban republic (as in Italy and Germany), there taxable “third estate” of the monarchy (as in France), afterwards, in the period of manufacture proper, serving either the semi-feudal or the absolute monarchy as a counterpoise against the nobility, and, in fact, cornerstone of the great monarchies in general, the bourgeoisie has at last, since the establishment of Modem Industry and of the world market, conquered for itself, in the modem representative State, exclusive political sway. The executive of the modern State is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie.

The bourgeoisie, historically, has played a most revolutionary part.

The bourgeoisie, wherever it has got the upper hand, has put an end to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations. It has pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his “natural superiors”, and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self-interest, than callous “cash payment”. It has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine sentimentalism, in the icy water of egotistical calculation. It has resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedom— Free Trade. In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.

The bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto honoured and looked up to with reverent awe. It has converted the physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the man of science, into its paid wage-labourers.

The bourgeoisie has tom away from the family its sentimental veil, and has reduced the family relation to a mere money relation.

The bourgeoisie has disclosed how it came to pass that the brutal display of vigour in the Middle Ages, which Reactionists so much admire, found its fitting complement in the most slothful indolence. It has been the first to show what man’s activity can bring about. It has accomplished wonders far surpassing Egyptian pyramids, Roman aqueducts, and Gothic cathedrals; it has conducted expeditions that put in the shade all former Exoduses of nations and crusades. 2 7

The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionising the instruments of production, and thereby the relations of production, and with them the whole relations of society. Conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form, was, on the contrary, the first condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes. Constant revolutionising of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones. All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all new- formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face, with sober senses, his real conditions of life, and his relations with his kind.

The need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe. It must nestle everywhere, settle everywhere, establish connexions everywhere.

The bourgeoisie has through its exploitation of the world market given a cosmopolitan character to production and consumption in every country. To the great chagrin of Reactionists, it has drawn from under the feet of industry the national ground on which it stood. All old-established national industries have been destroyed or are daily being destroyed. They are dislodged by new industries, whose introduction becomes a life and death question for all civilised nations, by industries that no longer work up indigenous raw material, but raw material drawn from the remotest zones; industries whose products are consumed, not only at home, but in every quarter of the globe. In place of the old wants, satisfied by the productions of the country, we find new wants, requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes. In place of the old local and national seclusion and self-sufficiency, we have intercourse in every direction, universal inter-dependence of nations. And as in material, so also in intellectual production. The intellectual creations of individual nations become common property. National one-sidedness and narrow-mindedness become more and more impossible, and from the numerous national and local literatures, there arises a world literature.

The bourgeoisie, by the rapid improvement of all instruments of production, by the immensely facilitated means of communication, draws all, even the most barbarian, nations into civilisation. The cheap prices of its commodities are the heavy artillery with which it batters down all Chinese walls, with which it forces the barbarians’ intensely obstinate hatred of foreigners to capitulate. It compels all nations, on pain of extinction, to adopt the bourgeois mode of production; it compels them to introduce what it calls civilisation into their midst, ie., to become bourgeois themselves. In one word, it creates a world after its own image.

The bourgeoisie has subjected the country to the rule of the towns. It has created enormous cities, has greatly increased the urban population as compared with the rural, and has thus rescued a considerable part of the population from the idiocy of rural life. Just as it has made the country dependent on the towns, so it has made barbarian and semi¬ barbarian countries dependent on the civilised ones, nations of peasants on nations of bourgeois, the East on the West.

The bourgeoisie keeps more and more doing away with the scattered state of the population, of the means of production, and of property. It has agglomerated population, centralised means of production, and has concentrated property in a few hands. The necessary consequence of this was political centralisation. Independent, or but loosely connected, provinces with separate interests, laws, governments and systems of taxation, became lumped together into one nation, with one government, one code of laws, one national class interest, one frontier and one customs-tariff.

The bourgeoisie, during its rule of scarce one hundred years, has created more massive and more colossal productive forces than have all preceding generations together. Subjection of Nature’s forces to man, machinery, application of chemistry to industry and agriculture, steam-navigation, railways, electric telegraphs, clearing of whole continents for cultivation, canalisation of rivers, whole populations conjured out of the ground—what earlier century had even a presentiment that such productive forces slumbered in the lap of social labour?

We see then: the means of production and of exchange, on whose foundation the bourgeoisie built itself up, were generated in feudal society. At a certain stage in the development of these means of production and of exchange, the conditions under which feudal society produced and ex¬ changed, the feudal organisation of agriculture and manufacturing industry, in one word, the feudal relations of property became no longer compatible with the already developed productive forces; they became so many fetters. They had to be burst asunder; they were burst asunder.

Into their place stepped free competition, accompanied by a social and political constitution adapted to it, and by the economical and political sway of the bourgeois class.

A similar movement is going on before our own eyes. Modem bourgeois society with its relations of production, of exchange and of property, a society that has conjured up such gigantic means of production and of exchange, is like the sorcerer, who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells. For many a decade past the history of industry and commerce is but the history of the revolt of modem productive forces against modem conditions of production, against the proper¬ ty relations that are the conditions for the existence of the bourgeoisie and of its rule. It is enough to mention the commercial crises that by their periodical return put on its trial, each time more threateningly, the existence of the entire bourgeois society. In these crises a great part not only of the existing products, but also of the previously created productive forces, are periodically destroyed. In these crises there breaks out an epidemic that, in all earlier epochs, would have seemed an absurdity—the epidemic of overproduction. Society suddenly finds itself put back into a state of momentary barbarism; it appears as if a famine, a universal war of devastation had cut off the supply of every means of subsistence; industry and commerce seem to be destroyed: and why? Because there is too much civilisation, too much means of subsistence, too much industry, too much commerce. The productive forces at the disposal of society no longer tend to further the development of the conditions of bourgeois property; on the contrary, they have become too powerful for these conditions, by which they are fettered, and so soon as they overcome these fetters, they bring disorder into the whole of bourgeois society, endanger the existence of bourgeois property. The conditions of bourgeois society are too narrow to comprise the wealth created by them. And how does the bourgeoisie get over these crises? On the one hand, by enforced destruction of a mass of productive forces; on the other, by the conquest of new markets, and by the more thorough exploitation of the old ones. That is to say, by paving the way for more extensive and more destructive crises, and by diminishing the means whereby crises are prevented.

The weapons with which the bourgeoisie felled feudalism to the ground are now turned against the bourgeoisie itself.

But not only has the bourgeoisie forged the weapons that bring death to itself; it has also called into existence the men who are to wield those weapons—the modem working class— the proletarians.

In proportion as the bourgeoisie, i.e., capital, is developed, in the same proportion is the proletariat, the modem working class, developed—a class of labourers, who live only so long as they find work, and who find work only so long as their labour increases capital. These labourers, who must sell themselves piecemeal, are a commodity, like every other article of commerce, and consequently exposed to all the vicissitudes of competition, to all the fluctuations of the market.

Owing to the extensive use of machinery and to division of labour, the work of the proletarians has lost all individual character, and, consequently, all charm for the workman. He becomes an appendage of the machine, and it is only the most simple, most monotonous, and most easily acquired knack, that is required of him. Hence, the cost of production of a workman is restricted, almost entirely, to the means of subsistence that he requires for his maintenance, and for the propagation of his race. But the price of a commodity, and therefore also of labour, 28 is equal to its cost of production. In proportion, therefore, as the repulsiveness of the work increases, the wage decreases. Nay more, in proportion as the use of machinery and division of labour increases, in the same proportion the burden of toil also increases, whether by prolongation of the working hours, by increase of the work exacted in a given time or by increased speed of the machinery, etc.

Modem industry has converted the little workshop of the patriarchal master into the great factory of the industrial capitalist. Masses of labourers, crowded into the factory, are organised like soldiers. As privates of the industrial army they are placed under the command of a perfect hierarchy of officers and sergeants. Not only are they slaves of the bourgeois class, and of the bourgeois State; they are daily and hourly enslaved by the machine, by the overlooker, and, above all, by the individual bourgeois manufacturer himself. The more openly this despotism proclaims gain to be its end and aim, the more petty, the more hateful and the more embittering it is.

The less the skill and exertion of strength implied in manual labour, in other words, the more modem industry becomes developed, the more is the labour of men superseded by that of women. Differences of age and sex have no longer any distinctive social validity for the working class. All are instruments of labour, more or less expensive to use, according to their age and sex.

No sooner is the exploitation of the labourer by the manufacturer, so far, at an end, and he receives his wages in cash, than he is set upon by the other portions of the bourgeoisie, the landlord, the shopkeeper, the pawnbroker, etc.

The lower strata of the middle class—the small trades¬ people, shopkeepers, and retired tradesmen generally, the handicraftsmen and peasants—all these sink gradually into the proletariat, partly because their diminutive capital does not suffice for the scale on which Modem Industry is carried on, and is swamped in the competition with the large capitalists, partly because their specialised skill is rendered worthless by new methods of production. Thus the proletariat is recruited from all classes of the population.

The proletariat goes through various stages of development. With its birth begins its struggle with the bourgeoisie. At first the contest is carried on by individual labourers, then by the workpeople of a factory, then by the operatives of one trade, in one locality, against the individual bourgeois who directly exploits them. They direct their attacks not against the bourgeois conditions of production, but against the instruments of production themselves; they destroy imported wares that compete with their labour, they smash to pieces machinery, they set factories ablaze, they seek to restore by force the vanished status of the workman of the Middle Ages.

At this stage the labourers still form an incoherent mass scattered over the whole country, and broken up by their mutual competition. If anywhere they unite to form more compact bodies, this is not yet the consequence of their own active union, but of the union of the bourgeoisie, which class, in order to attain its own political ends, is compelled to set the whole proletariat in motion, and is moreover yet, for a time, able to do so. At this stage, therefore, the proletarians do not fight their enemies, but the enemies of their enemies, the remnants of absolute monarchy, the landowners, the non- industrial bourgeois, the petty bourgeoisie. Thus the whole historical movement is concentrated in the hands of the bourgeoisie; every victory so obtained is a victory for the bourgeoisie.

But with the development of industry the proletariat not only increases in number; it becomes concentrated in greater masses, its strength grows, and it feels that strength more. The various interests and conditions of life within the ranks of the proletariat are more and more equalised, in proportion as machinery obliterates all distinctions of labour, and nearly everywhere reduces wages to the same low level. The growing competition among the bourgeois, and the resulting commercial crises, make the wages of the workers ever more fluctuating. The unceasing improvement of machinery, ever more rapidly developing, makes their livelihood more and more precarious; the collisions between individual workmen and individual bourgeois take more and more the character of collisions between two classes. Thereupon the workers begin to form combinations (Trades’ Unions) against the bourgeois; they club together in order to keep up the rate of wages; they found permanent associations in order to make provision beforehand for these occasional revolts. Here and there the contest breaks out into riots.

Now and then the workers are victorious, but only for a time. The real fruit of their battles lies, not in the immediate result, but in the ever-expanding union of the workers. This union is helped on by the improved means of communication that are created by modem industry and that place the workers of different localities in contact with one another. It was just this contact that was needed to centralise the numerous local struggles, all of the same character, into one national struggle between classes. But every class struggle is a political struggle. And that union, to attain which the burghers of the Middle Ages, with their miserable highways, required centuries, the modem proletarians, thanks to rail¬ ways, achieve in a few years.

This organisation of the proletarians into a class, and consequently into a political party, is continually being upset again by the competition between the workers themselves. But it ever rises up again, stronger, firmer, mightier. It compels legislative recognition of particular interests of the workers, by taking advantage of the divisions among the bourgeoisie itself. Thus the ten-hours’ bill in England was carried.

Altogether collisions between the classes of the old society further, in many ways, the course of development of the proletariat. The bourgeoisie finds itself involved in a constant battle. At first with the aristocracy; later on, with those portions of the bourgeoisie itself, whose interests have become antagonistic to the progress of industry; at all times, with the bourgeoisie of foreign countries. In all these battles it sees itself compelled to appeal to the proletariat, to ask for its help, and thus, to drag it into the political arena. The bourgeoisie itself, therefore, supplies the proletariat with its own elements of political and general education, in other words, it furnishes the proletariat with weapons for fighting the bourgeoisie.

Further, as we have already seen, entire sections of the ruling classes are, by the advance of industry, precipitated into the proletariat, or are at least threatened in their conditions of existence. These also supply the proletariat with fresh elements of enlightenment and progress.

Finally, in times when the class struggle nears the decisive hour, the process of dissolution going on within the ruling class, in fact within the whole range of old society, assumes such a violent, glaring character, that a small section of the ruling class cuts itself adrift, and joins the revolutionary class, the class that holds the future in its hands. Just as, therefore, at an earlier period, a section of the nobility went over to the bourgeoisie, so now a portion of the bourgeoisie goes over to the proletariat, and in particular, a portion of the bourgeois ideologists, who have raised themselves to the level of comprehending theoretically the historical movement as a whole.

Of all the classes that stand face to face with the bourgeoisie today, the proletariat alone is a really revolutionary class. The other classes decay and finally disappear in the face of modem industry; the proletariat is its special and essential product.

The lower middle class, the small manufacturer, the shopkeeper, the artisan, the peasant, all these fight against the bourgeoisie, to save from extinction their existence as fractions of the middle class. They are therefore not revolutionary, but conservative. Nay more, they are reactionary, for they try to roll back the wheel of history. If by chance they are revolutionary, they are so only in view of their impending transfer into the proletariat, they thus defend not their present, but their future interests, they desert their own standpoint to place themselves at that of the proletariat.

The “dangerous class”, the social scum, that passively rotting mass thrown off by the lowest layers of old society may, here and there, be swept into the movement by a proletarian revolution; its conditions of life, however, prepare it far more for the part of a bribed tool of reactionary intrigue.

In the conditions of the proletariat, those of old society at large are already virtually swamped. The proletarian is without property; his relation to his wife and children has no longer anything in common with the bourgeois family relations; modern industrial labour, modem subjection to capital, the same in England as in France, in America as in Germany, has stripped him of every trace of national character. Law, morality, religion, are to him so many bourgeois prejudices, be¬ hind which lurk in ambush just as many bourgeois interests.

All the preceding classes that got the upper hand, sought to fortify their already acquired status by subjecting society at large to their conditions of appropriation. The proletarians cannot become masters of the productive forces of society, except by abolishing their own previous mode of appropriation, and thereby also every other previous mode of appropriation. They have nothing of their own to secure and to fortify; their mission is to destroy all previous securities for and insurances of, individual property.

All previous historical movements were movements of minorities, or in the interest of minorities. The proletarian movement is the self-conscious, independent movement of the immense majority, in the interest of the immense majority. The proletariat, the lowest stratum of our present society, cannot stir, cannot raise itself up, without the whole super incumbent strata of official society being sprung into the air.

Though not in substance, yet in form, the struggle of the proletariat with the bourgeoisie is at first a national struggle. The proletariat of each country must, of course, first of all settle matters with its own bourgeoisie.

In depicting the most general phases of the development of the proletariat, we traced the more or less veiled civil war, raging within existing society, up to the point where that war breaks out into open revolution, and where the violent overthrow of the bourgeoisie lays the foundation for the sway of the proletariat.

Hitherto, every form of society has been based, as we have already seen, on the antagonism of oppressing and oppressed classes. But in order to oppress a class, certain conditions must be assured to it under which it can, at least, continue its slavish existence. The serf, in the period of serfdom, raised himself to membership in the commune, just as the petty bourgeois, under the yoke of feudal absolutism, managed to develop into a bourgeois. The modern labourer, on the contrary, instead of rising with the progress of industry, sinks deeper and deeper below the conditions of existence of his own class. He becomes a pauper, and pauperism develops more rapidly than population and wealth. And here it becomes evident, that the bourgeoisie is unfit any longer to be the ruling class in society, and to impose its conditions of existence upon society as an over-riding law. It is unfit to rule because it is incompetent to assure an existence to its slave within his slavery, because it cannot help letting him sink into such a state, that it has to feed him, instead of being fed by him. Society can no longer live under this bourgeoisie, in other words, its existence is no longer compatible with society.

The essential condition for the existence, and for the sway of the bourgeois class, is the formation and augmentation of capital; the condition for capital is wage labour. Wage labour rests exclusively on competition between the labourers. The advance of industry, whose involuntary promoter is the bourgeoisie, replaces the isolation of the labourers, due to competition, by their revolutionary combination, due to association. The development of Modem Industry, therefore, cuts from under its feet the very foundation on which the bourgeoisie produces and appropriates products. What the bourgeoisie, therefore, produces, above all, is its own gravediggers. Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable.",/r/teenagers/comments/o3d581/just_a_chunk_of_the_communist_manifesto/,7

I watched Penn and Teller Bullshit episode on this and changed my mind about it.

There is also good sex education like in Europe and the drinking age is lowered like in Germany.

Most people in this society choose to go through astronaut training because it is cool.

We had a show in the 1960s and the 1990s that got people excited for space and the future. It was called ""Star Trek"" a they still have it but it is a generic military space opera that tries too hard to be like Mass Effect and fails.

52,o6h2vp,teenagers,Wed Jun 23 20:01:30 2021,I sent an anime meme by mistake in my school WhatsApp group that had a little inappropriate picture of a female anime character. What should I do?,"So basically I was supposed to send an anime meme to one of my friends but by mistake I sent the picture to my group. Now in panic, I tried to delete the picture but there was just the option ""delete for me"" and I thought that maybe because it is not a downloaded picture and just a copied picture then if I delete it for myself only then it will get deleted for everyone but that was not the case. It was obvious that there was some bug but I just deleted it for me in panic. After that I had no other option to delete that picture and my classmates and teacher saw it. One of the students replied saying that I probably have sent it in the wrong group. I agreed and apologized. It was humiliating. Also.......bcoz of corona, we have been having classes online so I don't know most of the students as I joined this school in the previous grade that is previous year and it has been online classes since then. The meme is about the evolution of character in anime and it was a comparison between pokemon characters, degimon and childhood friends in anime. And the picture used for the childhood friend for the evolved version was a girl with huge boobs wearing a towel after bath. So after my apology, a few other students also asked me about the meme I sent on the class group and I said that I sent it by mistake but still I am scared about my teacher asking me about it. Well the thing is that if u are American or European or from some other liberal country.......things like that would be very normal but I live in India and things like having sex before marriage is steriotyped and there are many other restrictions and stereotype...........basically, if u get caught in India watching porn then the reaction of parents would be I guess equal to a minor getting pregnant in US. Like literally I know someone whose parents disowned them because they were caught masturbating. So yeah, I sent that meme in the group and now everyone has seen it, I can't delete it, the matter has been cool for sometime now but still I don't know if my teachers are gonna react on it and am I gonna get in trouble. Give me some advice what should I do?

Once again let me mention that I am getting so freak out cause I am from India and here this is some serious shit.

65,o7n3x1,teenagers,Fri Jun 25 15:53:20 2021,Final Day Here...,"Since this is my last day as a teenager, I'd figure I'd give you guys some advice. Before we start, I'd like to thank the mods for doing their best to moderate this crazy, funny, and helpful subreddit. Without them this place would be chaos. Without further ado, here are some things I've learned from my teenage years. 

 \- Have an idea when you enter High School what you want to do after High School. It will help you plan for your future.

\- Sometimes it makes more sense to go to cheaper college than the better. 

\- Your friends are temporary. Learn to move on and make new friends. 

\- Be bold. Beyond a cliche, take responsible risks. There is only so much time in your life, don't waste any of it. 

\- Go to school. Beyond being a boomer statement, staying school will increase you chances of success at life late. 

\- When it comes to relationships, you can wait. While this may contradict the ""Be bold"", but you're still growing and may not act on genuine love, but lust. 

\- Dudes, learn the difference between love and lust. Lust is where you only ""love"" a girl because you want to bang or she's hot; love is where you have stuff in common and love the person, not their body.

\- If you're in the US, learn to drive. This is will be a major assistance to life in general and not having this skill can be limiting

\- Sometimes you shouldn't beat around the bush. Be honest with yourself, and others. If you screwed up, admit it. Being honest with yourself is the first step to being a better person. 

\- Treat yourself with respect. If you're being overworked tell your teachers, they are trained to help you. If they don't tell a school counselor. 

\- May sound cliche, but go outside. Improves your health, and helps you de-stress. 

\- If socially awkward, I can tell you it gets better. Close to half a decade ago, I used to stand in the corner of parties, now I talk to people and have tons of friends. 

\- Ladies, trust your gut. If a guy or person feels off, GET AWAY. 

\- Ladies, the key to communicating with guys is being honest. If you like him, tell him that; if you don't want to go out with him, tell him. The easiest way to remember this is think of communication with guys is like communicating with a five year old. Tell them exactally what you're thinking, don't beat around the bush. 

\- Dudes, it you may feel creepy asking out a girl the first time. This is completely normally, and every other heterosexual guy has had the same feeling at sometime. 

\- LGBTQ+ folks! Embrace who you are. No god or person can change who you are. 

\- Suicide is NEVER THE ANSWER. EVER. 

\- Communication is key to friendships and relationships. If you don't want to do something, tell them; if you think your friend is making a terrible choice/decision, tell them. 

\- As always, don't be mean to the teacher. Especially if your class is early in the morning, they've got another 7-8 hours of classes to teach, don't make their day terrible for the rest of the day. 

\- Enjoy doing what you love. Whatever it is, enjoy it. If you like taking pictures of turtles, do that. If you enjoy drawing ""art"", draw ""art"". 

\- No is an acceptable answer. If you don't want to do something, go out with someone, or agree with something; ""No"" is an acceptable answer. 

\- Do  self-reflections every now and then. Identify your weaknesses, both personally and professionally, and think of ways to bolster yourself there. 

\- Don't vape. Seriously, it will damage your lungs and you'll pay the price later in life. It's short-term gain for no long-term benefit. 

\- Guys, just because she was nice to you doesn't automatically mean she likes you. If you're not sure, ask. 

\- Understand that the vast majority of adults were once in you're position, but with perspective. If they're dismissive or hostile towards, you they may have a reason. As with above, it may not hurt to ask. 

\- Separate religion from your outward life. No one wants to know that you are X faith and go to Y church. Also don't make it your personality. 

\- Try new things. 

\- Its nice to check in with your friends at least once a month. You cannot read their mind, sometimes they need a hug and are waiting for someone to ask them how they are. 

\- When preparing to go to university/college, be ready. It harder in some aspects, but easier in others.

\- Freshman year, in both college and high school, join some clubs and start think about what you want to do in life. 

\- If you can make your schedule in college, DON'T SIGN UP FOR 8AM CLASSES unless you've got a serious coffee addiction or are already alert at that time. 

\- Sleep is vital. You need 6-8 hours of *good* sleep. If that means you take care of something tomorrow, then so be it. 

\- The key to your weight is portion control. Don't eat more than you'll burn in a day. If you want to gain weight, eat a lot. If you want to lose weight, eat less. 

\- Americans, college, as you've heard, is ducking expensive. Get a job, if you can, to help pay for it; but scholarships are easy money. 

\- Take a break from social media every now and then. It has negative affects on your self-perception and mental health. 

\- If your not sure what you want to do with life, that's normal; but you will need to find answer by the time you are Junior in either High School or College/University. 

\- If you're going to learn a second language, make it specific to what you want to do in life. For example, guys if you want to weld, learn German; ladies if you want to be a nurse, learn Latin (and find some Greek on the side as medicine is more Greek than Latin). If you don't know what you want to do and you live in the US, learn Spanish, otherwise English or Mandarin are generic global second languages.

\- Learn to time manage. Key to being a successful adult is time management. 

\- Take care of yourself. If you smell, others around you can tell, and will not want to be near you. 

\- Learn safe sex. Dudes, wear a condom and always ask for consent; if she says no, that means no. If your school doesn't teach safe sex practices, look them up. 

\- Learn your rights. If you think someone's rights are being violated video-tape it and report it to law enforcement, if it's law enforcement violating it; send to to the American Civil Liberties Union. 

\- Get vaccinated, if your parents don't want you to get vaccinated or you live in a state/nation that doesn't require them, ask your school if you can get vaccinated there or ask your doctor.

\- Speaking of doctors, when you're in for checkup, you can tell your parents to leave. If they don't want to tell them ""To bad"". 

\- If you're still single at end of this time, that's okay. Try not to feel pressure with your friends getting relationships. (If you need some mental encouragement, remind yourself that most young relationships (14-25) end within a year.)

\- If you fall into the LGBTQ+ category, don't make it your entire personality. 

\- Don't make a single trait your entire personality. Diversify yourself.

\- You may not be able to drink (and you shouldn't), but try to come up with a 1-3 sentence that you may use to introduce yourself at a bar or party. It should wrap up your personality and who you are easily. (For example: ""Hi! My name is Basileus\_Ioannes and I'm a 19 year old nerd, history geek, and teacher."")

\- Being a teenager feels like an eternity, but time passes quicker than you think

\- Learn how to file taxes and manage a budget. Economic key to life is to budgeting. 

\- Have laugh every now and then. Humor is good for you physically and mentally.

&amp;#x200B;

76,obhvr2,teenagers,Thu Jul  1 12:09:29 2021,I don’t know what to do. I’m just so mad and confused,"So my cat is an indoor-outdoor cat, she goes in and out of the house pretty regularly but she hasn’t been home in the last 3 days, I mean she’s done that once before but I’m really worried about her since we just had two 110°F days in a row and yesterday was 80°, and today marking the 4th day was about 75° so it’s been pretty hot and she hasn’t stopped by to get a drink of water and cool down. I’ve checked all of her usual hunting grounds and even checked up in the trees. She is a very capable cat and I’m sure either someone took her in for a few nights or she ventured out a little far and is just being ornery. I am worried though that something did get her and I can’t help but think the worst even though I’m trying to be positive. I just can’t help thinking she died outside alone, scared, and in pain. I haven’t seen a body or smelt any foul odors coming from the yard though and I have seen a pile of feathers (a bird she would have killed) which is where most of my hood is coming from. The part that makes me mad though isn’t the fact that she’s not back it’s the consequences and discussions we are having because she hasn’t shown up yet. My little sister (9) on the first day she didn’t come home said “if the cats dead can I get a hamster” which really pissed me off and I yelled at her then and there telling her that’s disrespectful and rude in front of our parents. My dad is just like me being hopeful that she will show up but I can tell it’s just a cover and he doesn’t believe 1/2 of what he says and is only pretending to be hopeful just to make me happy but I don’t care because I prefer that over the alternative. My mom is just like my sister, just tonight she said “something probably got her, but don’t worry we will get another cat, but it will never be as good as yours” which also pissed me off because she hasn’t even been gone for a month, why is she taking about getting another animal. When I was my little sisters age about 9, I had an American bull dog that passed away from health issues and what not and I started talking about wanting another dog about a week after her passing and I got yelled at by both parents about how it’s disrespectful to talk about getting another pet so soon. And I scolded my parents when my sister said what she said because they didn’t have the same discussion with her as they did me. They then got mad at me saying “she’s too young, she won’t understand” which really ticked me off because I got that discussion when I was her age what’s the difference between me and her. All evidence I have shows that my cat is still alive and we are going to my local vet tomorrow to see if any strays that look like my cat have been brought in. But my cat is very intelligent, very predatory, and is a bad ass cat so if there’s any cat that can take down other predators twice her size it’s her. She will make it back home and I will refuse to believe something killed her until I have cold hard evidence in front of me. Sorry for the long rant but this is very stressful and angering for me and I don’t have anyone else to talk about this with without making them mad and upset. I will keep everyone updated for the next week on the status of my cat but after that I think all hope is lost.",/r/teenagers/comments/obhvr2/i_dont_know_what_to_do_im_just_so_mad_and_confused/,0

I fell in to this trap from day one, and it was okay until I was about 13 years old. The point when you start maturing is when you realize how much the title actually means, and I was very late to the party. I asked my parents for things since I even knew that I could. I admit, I was a pretty awful kid. I was always asking for things (rarely got them) and was never very thankful when I did get them. This put me in bad standings with them that I never realized. So when my time came that I found the glory of the personal gaming computer over a console, I immediately started thinking about getting one. It would be a whole ass year of research before I was even close to getting even a slightly powerful pc. Once I did it was all downhill from there, out of nowhere my mom started beating my sister for small problems and I got the side effects of that. I started using my pc more and more to escape my family and try to get my emotions in check. It didn’t work at all. My mom started getting abusive towards me whenever I tried to escape them. I started getting in discord calls with my friends even more than I already did,resulting in my mom starting to call them racial slurs because of them being from India and Nepal and me being a completely white male in America. They would criticize every single thing they did for no reason whatsoever. After all of the racism towards my friends, they would repeatedly get pissed at me for even being related to them, which would in turn get me pissed at my parents. However these friends would have extreme respect for their parents since they were spoiled like crazy. So whenever I complained about my parents they would get mad at me for complaining since I was “spoiled.” Then once one who was kind of the leader of the group got u and left me, all the others left as well. At that point i was stuck with two friends who I couldn’t play games with, couldn’t meet in person, and could barely talk to at all anyways since I never had any free time away from my parents. The next four months of my life would be an absolute shit show since I was stuck with nothing to do and no one to talk to. Then, finally! The leader of said group of friends was finally into talks to play a couple games together again! Everything was starting to look up again and I thought I might finally have something to do. Yeah then he fucken backstabbed me and I was stuck alone again -__- Then we get to present day finally, my mom being extremely abusive and me just occasionally being late to swim practice. All I did was be late to today’s practice since my alarm didn’t go off for some reason and now I’m stuck without power in my room for the next week and not being allowed out of the house or in a room with locking doors. Life sucks.

TLDR: Title, don’t get too attached to possessions unless it actually helps you to find something you like or friends you like. I know from experience its awful if combined with shitty parents.

85,oj4ivs,teenagers,Tue Jul 13 03:43:47 2021,I feel like I am messing my life up,"So once again it’s 2 am and I’m in my rant mode. 

Lemme summarize my life so that all of this is more understandable:

In primary school I was one of those gifted children who never studied for anything and always got the best marks. It was probably the best part of my life (yeah I know, I peeked in elementary school). I even got overconfident because everybody praised me for my intelligence. 

So due to my good grades and stuff I got into a pretty challenging middle school. If you haven’t realized it by now, that’s when everything went downhill really fast. My grades started having constant seizures (I got an A on one test and a D on the next one). My GPA starting travelling to the center of the earth. I don’t know how exactly the school system works in America, but here when you fail one of your classes, you have to repeat the whole school year. Fortunately for me that had never happened to me however there were many occasions were things got pretty close. Subjects like Latin kicked my ass however somehow I managed to pass with B being my average grade. 

Anyways that sound like a semi-happy ending right? Oh fuck no because I’m in high school now. I just got through my freshman year and I literally almost got an F on six subjects. I ultimately managed to correct all of them, but that’s still pretty atrocious. About a third of my class failed and has to repeat this year and honestly I feel really bad. Some of them actually put in a lot of effort and still didn’t manage to pass while I’m just here doing absolutely nothing. 

The other thing is that all of my friends are like extremely successful. They’re winning competitions and shit while I’m just here doing absolutely nothing with my life. I’m scared that I am wasting the time where I’m actually able to learn so much on watching youtube. I always want to learn so many things but the only times my brain actually is ready to learn something is after midnight. 

Honestly, I'm messing my whole life up",/r/teenagers/comments/oj4ivs/i_feel_like_i_am_messing_my_life_up/,9

6,okmfzi,teenagers,Thu Jul 15 08:43:28 2021,I fucking hate how I can't even talk about China without someone holding me personally accountable for all the horrible things the Chinese government is doing.,"Let me preface this by saying I DO NOT support the Uighur genocide in ANY way and I think Hong Kong should be independent because I know some little edgelord is going to accuse me of being a Chinese propagandist.

I was telling some people about how I thought that China had a better pandemic response than America, and immediately like six different people started asking me shit like ""oh you support the Chinese government genociding Uighurs then???"" ""Oh so you don't want freedom for Hong Kong???"" ""Wow you're just gonna gloss over [insert horrible thing the Chinese government is doing here]???"" 

The thing is this happens EVERY time I even try to insinuate that China did something better than America. Like when I mentioned that I thought Americans tend to have a much lower opinion of China than I do and got the same response. Or when I said Chinese education teaches students more things. Or even when I said I liked Chinese food better than American. 

Or even when I correct someone's misconception about China. ""No, the one-child policy doesn't mean that the government gets to execute one of your family members if a second child is born. It just means you have to pay a fine."" ""Well isn't someone just a good little Chinese propagandist?"" Like wtf no I just don't want this misinformation spreading around.

If I tell people I don't want to talk about it I get shit for enabling it, as if my born-and-raised-American ass can do anything about it. I don't have a direct phone line to the Chinese government and even if I did, you think they'd listen to a random teenager? Tf

Or if I continue the conversation and agree that yes, I think genocide is bad, but I don't hate China with a burning fucking passion and am not ashamed of being Chinese, somehow people ALWAYS twist it into I'm advocating for genocide.


And... why the fuck can't I just have some topics I don't want to talk about? Genocide is depressing and it's fucking exhausting when it's all people want to talk about just because I'm Chinese. If I went around asking people about the Holocaust every time they mentioned something vaguely German, I'd be a huge dick, but it's okay when someone else does it to me since I'm Chinese?

What the fuck is this? Can I not talk about my culture without a barrage of people telling me I should be ashamed of myself and my heritage or else I'm supporting genocide? I can't even tell people that I think Chinese grammar is more intuitive than English without at least one person accusing me of genocide at this point. I'm so sick and tired of having to defend myself against all of these accusations just because some people who happen to look like me are being assholes in the worst possible way.

WE will be the ones living through the new age they call ""the fourth industrial revolution"" - a technological boom/growth so advanced and so rapid NEVER before seen in human history.... it's terrifying, I know. We're barely 20 years into this new chapter of history and it's up to us to chart the uncertain future. 

Just look at how far the internet has evolved - what used to be the wild west has slowly, over time, evolved into a large digital landscape full of ""cities"", communities, strange back alleys, secrets, memes and factions. 

I understand the dissatisfaction with the real world. Travelling anywhere is a pain in the ass, America's infrastructure is collapsing, political discourse is at a critical point and to top it all off there's a pandemic that just doesnt seem to end. So why interface with reality when you can travel anywhere and everywhere on the internet. 

Hot women? Cute femboys? Check!
Funny vloggers, streamers and influencers? Check! Strangers from all over the world who can relate to your pain? Check! 
A growing, empathetic LGBT community? Check!
Memes, history videos, fan art, surrealist content galore! The internet has it all!

Everything except physical intimacy... but why bother when it's so much easier to communicate online. Behind an avatar where you don't have to think off your feet to have a conservation. Where your looks and your behaviorism and your tone of voice dont have to get in the way of interacting with others...

And there then comes the split between the online you and the real you. The funny persona on reddit versus the deeply hurt quiet kid in the back... 

I cant tell you how often I look up from my screen and the real world looks foggy. The textures feel bland. And if I'm not looking at the screen for too long, then comes the FOMO...

So how do we integrate ourselves back into the real world - how can we look at reality again with fresh eyes,  a fresh perspective? Idk guys, it's a struggle....  but I'm right here with all of you trying to figure this BS out because at the core of this mess we call existence, there is always an ecstatic truth worth fighting for and I hope one day we can all find it.

ive never told this to anyone in my life, but i think getting it out there may help (therapy is expensive, venting on reddit is free).

this all happened when i was around the age of 9-11, in other words VERY young. i watched youtube videos of people going on omegle, and just seeing what would happen. i wanted to copy them, one thing led to another and soon enough i was doing extremely explicit shit for men old enough to be my dad. doesnt help that i hit puberty in 3rd grade, so i definitely didnt look my age back then (you dont see many 10 year olds with c-cups)

i remember one incident that happened. some fat guy in a sailor moon costume had asked me to record him drinking his own cum, hoping that this would get him viral. another guy asked to see my feet. 

i remember another incident. i was really into overwatch at the time, and i was drawing a headshot of tracer (it was actually kinda good, but i threw it in the garbage about a year ago). i was on omegle while i was drawing the headshot, and soon there was a guy that asked to see me without a shirt. for some reason i was wearing a bra (idk why, it was like midnight when this happened), so i took it off. i quickly left after that because i was hella creeped out (as if doing all that shit i did before this wasnt creepy enough), and eventually i landed on the same guy. turns out he WAS RECORDING ME WHEN I TOOK OFF MY SHIRT. that motherfucker was using it was blackmail. i still hope that guy has a very painful death. thats all he deserves, as well as the other pedophiles i interacted with. i couldnt give a shit if thats harsh, those assholes gave me trauma. 

the interaction that started all of this was probably when i met an australian guy on omegle. he had just gotten done surfing and his black hair was wet, i think he was white? not sure. anyway, we talked around for a few minutes, i showed him my boobs and i think after that he showed me his dick. don’t remember much after that. this incident was probably the one that started my underage-camgirl faze. luckily around 5th grade i stopped doing that shit.

76,oteu7w,teenagers,Wed Jul 28 20:37:28 2021,"Alright so I met one of my bestfriend's friends and I don't think I lile her (She's American and I'm Asian, I haven't met a lot of people from America so I'm new to people like her)","Alright I'll start off with a Prince reference

Good Morning ladies and gentlemen, boys and motherfucking girls, this is your captain with no name speaking and I'm here to rock your world

Okay, firstly, this isn't strictly American people I just wanna point out she's American because it might help give context? Sorry if I come off as racist.

She's your average twitter girl that you see and just laugh at because of all the stupid shit she tweets (Also lesbian, all for that no racism, which she sucks at, hate all men, etc, that type of stuff)

So we were in a call and everyone in the call was straight except her, and she called us homophobic for being straight, I'm not homophobic but people like this are the reason why I don't really wanna be with gay people, don't get me wrong, I have gay, lesbian, and bi friends, it's nice to be around them, they're nice.

Another thing is that she kept saying how all men are trash, like, can she even hear herself? What she's saying is blatantly sexist, and she goes like ""it's only sexist if it's toward girls"", Not all men are like this, and let's face the truth, most guys aren't even as bad as her. It really pisses me off how people generalize this, most of the time it's just teenage girls who've experienced one breakup, I can understand if you've been raped, mistreated, abused but if you're going to hate men just because someone told you to? That's low and pathetic. This applies to everything really, not just men.

Third is she was having trouble with her valorant (She called Valorant homophobic, she's so stupid it's hilarious) and we told her to search youtube for help and not asking us about it because we also don't know what to do, then she says she doesn't want that because that's going to support white people, and she's not racist. Excuse me? That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard, racism is basically hating on one or more races. And she says she's not racist....heh.. so dumb

4th thing I really hate is I was trying to help her with her val problem because she's too ""non racist"" and she wasn't appreciating that and she went ""if you're heterosexual, you're going to hell, also if you oppose or object that, you're also going to hell"", also a generic and stupid remark people like her make.

Last but not least, she told me, ""try opposing me and I'll go to twitter and cancel you, I'll call Trisha Paytas on your ass and make her do a talk show on your ass"" 
What are you going to cancel me for? I'm the one in the right, and you're clearly the offensive one here.

7,nujyx9,nyc,Mon Jun  7 21:40:55 2021,I lost my panties and Blunt. 😂😂😂,"So I decided to write something that I felt was absolutely halarious as fuck. Hopefully you guys find this funny too. 
..
So on June 5th I decided to spend my Saturday in a fucked up state. So I woke up at 10am, rolled and smoked my first blunt, made breakfast and then got dressed. I decided to go to Coney Island Park in Brooklyn and spend the majority of the day there. I left out the house with clothes on including panties. The panties I wore that day was Victoria Secret grayish-blue leopard bikini cut panties which were $60.00 usd(honestly I don't want them panties back. I think it's cute someone is walking around with my DNA on panties) so anyways I took my panties off to put on my bathing suit. I put the panties in my backpack and proceeded to enjoy my day at Coney Island. At 7pm I leave Coney Island and goes home (prospect Park area) and showers again and change. I wore an outfit that was sexy and different with 8 holes going down one side of the leg and required no panties. I put the panties in my purse just in case I needed them and I rolled a perfectly fat blunt and decided to head on to Fort Greene Brooklyn and bar hopped. Now I went to a bar and dranked there and then went to another bar and dranked there as well. Now I did get drunk and while being drunk I opened up my purse and somehow my blunt and panties fell out. Now by the time I realized that I lost my blunt AND panties was the next day after recovering from a mean ass hangover. 
..
So I'm convinced someone in Fort Greene either threw my panties out and smoked my blunt, or They kept my panties and smoked my blunt. 
..
Either way... They got a good high cause the pussy juices are dried and GREAT and the blunt was the best weed acquired in NYC. So hope they had fun.

9,nvrotx,nyc,Wed Jun  9 12:32:57 2021,"If a worker asks you to wear a mask in their business, just do it. Don't argue.","I work somewhere high-profile that used to have one of the strictest ""wear a mask"" policies in NYC. Until recently we had a one-and-done mask-off policy, we were very _very_ straightforward about that. We have a lot of relatively tight spaces often occupied for semi-lengthy periods by decent numbers of people. 

However, our workspace also has a procedure with dedicated staff members/managers that explicitly deal/dealt with belligerent rule-breakers to escort them out. That means a lot of us who aren't equipped to deal with rowdy guests weren't asked to do so. 

I cannot tell you how much I would dread this part of the job if I worked anywhere else. Actually, I do dread it; I'd dip out of the space for a few minutes once I made eye contact with someone not wearing a mask. People are _absolute assholes_ about the whole mask-wearing thing. And it's especially awful because so many of us working in-person are minimum wage (or close enough) and there is not enough money one can pay us to deal with people shouting about what's ""actually safety"" after a year of what's essentially emotional trauma about our lives. 

Not to mention I can tell you for a fact that the number of out-of-state people coming back to NYC is absurdly high. It was mostly locals before, even a month and a half ago; now I'd estimate half the people I talk to are from out of the NYC metro area, and more from out of the city. 

And let me tell you: **people _will_ follow the ""mask culture"" that they see.** That means if you're in a business with a mask off, they _will_ take their mask off. It happened even where I worked; we had a lot of ""chain effect"" moments where when we failed to take care of someone in a timely manner, we ended up seeing a _lot_ more people breaking the rule too. It was a topic of discussion after one major holiday. 

So imagine a metric asston of people from out of town, many of whom think this is ""over,"" many of whom I can tell you are from countries where the population _hasn't even reached a 10% full vaccination rate,_ and they see you walking around in a business without a mask and go, ""Okay, this is fine!"" It goddamn isn't. 

And by the way, **CDC guidelines say businesses can enforce mask-wearing.** And honestly, _these businesses know better than you_ whether or not mask-wearing should be enforced. If they're still enforcing it, I promise you, they have thought that through because some of y'all are _still_ absolutely unbearable when asked to wear a few more square inches of fabric on your faces. 

**tl;dr don't be a dick, just put the damn mask on if someone asks.** Hell, just do it anyway. You've been doing it for a year, you can do it for another two or three months.",/r/nyc/comments/nvrotx/if_a_worker_asks_you_to_wear_a_mask_in_their/,0

As part of my doctoral dissertation research, I am interested in learning about family planning and birth control use in the South Asian community in New York City. I am looking to interview men and women who would be willing to share their experience, thoughts, and beliefs about contraceptive use. Participants must be: • Between 18-45 years of age • Of South Asian ancestry (India, Nepal, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Maldives) • Living in New York City • Engage(s/d) in sexual activity that could result in a pregnancy I anticipate the interview to be approximately 45-60 minutes long. The interview will take place virtually (i.e. Skype or Zoom) and will be scheduled during a date/time most convenient for the participant. Participation will also include completing a brief online demographic/background questionnaire which should take an additional 5-7 minutes. Participants will be compensated $30 either via cash or gift card (your choice) for their time and experience. If you would like to participate in the study, please contact me either via text or call at ‪(516) 512-7764‬ or Nandini.Shroff50@sphmail.cuny.edu.

Had a temp company try not pay me for the training, I sent them a sweet letter about keeping anyone from getting into trouble by violating labor laws. Make sure you get paid for this training and any other mandatory training. If they say no, get it in writing and contact the labor board when you're secure in the position or moving on to another. Especially watch for this if you're working for a temp agency.

TL;DR? I'm sucking the city's dick hardbody, fucking gluck gluck, round the world 7500, chipmunkin' the shit out the city's dick. Cause I was out in some bullshit ass, weak, small dick energy ass work environment, and I ready to be hurt again. Let the city be real disrespectful to me for 40 minutes type love. 

Not just a city, not the city, I miss THE fucking city. And like all places and organizations, it is the people that are the true valuables and characters that bring life to it and makes anything worth experiencing. I’m so, so tired of working with mfs that are so used to being an average at best piece of shit in their tiny fucking town that it goes to their tiny little, prepubescent little boy hasn’t dropped yet testicle sized brain, yet walk around like they got bull testicles and have a donkey dick sized ego. Fucking, the gap between their ego/ work experience and intelligence is so fucking vast, if they jumped from their ego to their over all intelligence/work experience, they’d hit terminal velocity, do a fucking backflip, hit TV again, take a nap, wake up, smoke crack, catch, cook, and eat a lobster, and still have a day and a half left of free falling. 

I had one lady that was the only EMT in her shit town and would tell us the same two stories about how she had to help an old man that fell down. I don’t even think she was in a town, I don’t know what the parameters are, but she was probably from a village or some shit. First time I ever met her, first fucking thing she says to me is ""Who the fuck are you and what is your function here?"" Hey, you fucking unwashed butt plug, look at my name tape. Now look at at the ICS chart. Yea, cool, I get it, your dick so big that you need to toss it over your shoulder and wear it like a scarf, but who the fuck are *you* and how about some **professional** decorum, you pickled, dry rot, wrinkled head looking ass bitch? Also, your mom's a hoe. Best part, she was a nobody in the Chain of Command at the site I was. Fucking, *I* was higher up than she was. Fuck that. 
I missed working and interacting with mfs that come from a city of 8 million, not from Smurf bum ass village. When you know you gotta grind and hustle to stay on the float or some young buck with a Costco sized bag of fucking Doritos on their shoulder pulls up and runs you out your game, you keep learning and progressing. Very rarely will you meet folks (or at least me) between 18-30 that are slacking recklessly, just letting people run laps around them, with the most disrespect. You know what you had to do to get to where you're at (unless you're some trust fund kid, but I'm sure even they got *some struggles* us plebs won't understand), and you know there's someone out there that started with less and hungrier than you are. You got folks that will tell it to you real, and if you continue being a dickhead, someone's going to catch you slacking and learn you some character development real good off the clock. Just the fucking ""Yea, fuck it, can do"" attitude was missed. 

The speed at which things operated was so fucking slow, I thought I was driving to Long Island from Jersey on a Friday evening. I would let mfs know we were short shit, and sure a fuck, five weeks, fucking WEEKS, would pass by before they would order and deliver it. How the absolute fuck does ANY organization function like this? Sure as fuck not NYC. Tell me if I'm wrong, unless it's some annex office, not a priority type sure, sure, whatever. But I'm talking about shit that was ""yo, we don't got XYZ, the whole mission fucked sideways"" type goonery. Imagine being an [accountant] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SBQD5UNViw) (fuck these suspicious squirrel head looking ass folks do anyways?) and not having access to either QuickBooks, Peachtree, or Excel. Like, I'm assuming you're going to be fucked. Or IDK, an accountant without happy hour. Alcohol. You get the point. These folks I was working with (not my team, the county mfs) were working at peak goon speed. Fuck that. I was not about it. 

There's a whole bunch of other shit I could say to shit on other places, but I'm a couple drinks deep and just being real sloppy about this post, so it is what it is. I missed the city and this shit. If you're here, appreciate what we got, cause this shit is real special man, compared to literally every single other ""city,"" town, whatever the fuck you call it, ain't nothing like home.

I work in an industry where I have to deal with all the tradies that are coming up from Sydney and the central coast. I’m absolutely done with this inept government. There are 440,000 people in this area, one would think you would want to get as many shots into this area before the virus reaches here. I should have said I was aboriginal on my booking, I’d be fully vaccinated by now.

45,p5sj22,sydney,Tue Aug 17 03:07:31 2021,Australia dipped into COVAX Pfizer stockpile intended for poor nations,"Not sure if this has been reported before but according to [this](https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/australia-dipped-into-covax-pfizer-stockpile-intended-for-poor-nations-20210816-p58j2j.html) on SMH, it happened in June.

Few pieces from the article :

&gt;Australia has raided 500,000 doses of Pfizer from a scheme set up to ensure poorer countries receive fair and equitable access to vaccines, as low and middle-income nations still wait for vaccines.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Australian government in June purchased 25 million doses out of the global COVAX facility as it scrambled to source more supplies of the Pfizer vaccine and received about 500,000 doses from that order – **double what the entire continent of Africa received under COVAX in the same month**.  
&gt;  
&gt;Under [the World Health Organisation-run scheme](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p579f3), rich countries such as Australia provide money to ensure vaccines can be set aside for poorer nations. **But under a second stream, countries including Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand have also dipped into the scheme to purchase vaccines on the basis that their domestic supplies have fallen short of expectations**.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the same month that Australia made its mammoth purchase, Britain also received about 530,000 doses from COVAX.

Yes Australia is not alone in doing this, but we criticised the EU for holding AZ doses, and now we have become the EU. At the very least I hope Aus is giving AZ to replace that stockpile.

It's frustrating and frankly, a dick move.",/r/sydney/comments/p5sj22/australia_dipped_into_covax_pfizer_stockpile/,0

47,paa9pk,sydney,Tue Aug 24 01:21:50 2021,Why do these horrible people keep winning elections?,"I've ben living here over 10 years having come from overseas. I love Sydney, I love the people I meet and the people I work with. I feel at home in my neighbourhood and I feel properly part of a community, in which I have seen people be caring, understanding and compassionate to others. I try to do the same.

What is giving me a lot of concern at the moment is the politicians - and more so the fact that the people keep voting them in. Disgusting shadows of humanity like Clive Palmer (I know he's not any more but he may as well be), George Christensen, Barnaby Joyce, Pauline Hanson, Malcolm Roberts, even our PM Scott Morrison - a man so devoid of any compassion, empathy or honesty that everyone sees right through him.

This government has fucked up the vaccine rollout so badly that we are still in lockdown, while the rest of the world is returning to normal. The hard-ass stance towards immigrants and ""we won't budge"" statement about not taking in any more people even though we royally fucked up in Afghanistan and caused a huge refugee crisis, basically handing millions of women and girls back to a bunch of religious woman-hating fundamentalists. Its heartless. On top of all that , the PM and deputy PM are ignorant, science-denying fucktards who clearly do not listen to experts when it really matters - letting our emissions climb and the great barrier reef bleach up.

Yet after all that, today in the SMH it says their support is claiming and they could win again. At this stage its the people who I'm annoyed with - what soul-less cunts are voting these politicians in? And if they are in the majority, are they not what Australia really represents? I despair. What do you think?

i posted last week and got an incredible amount of supportive messages on my post where i opened up about my child sexual abuse story and cutting myself off / disowning my family. 

i am tremendously sad and depressed and am working through these issues with a therapist, but feel drained, exhausted, and utterly... the literal definition of depressed every day i'm not seeing my therapist. 

i have used unhealthy coping mechanisms like self neglect, self harm and drugs/alc and obviously none of it is making me feel better.

i am / have lived in nyc thru the pandemic and still feel residual anxiety doing things in the city. im out and about way more now but when i spiral from depression its still hard to leave my room and i fall back into ""im in lockdown"" mode.

23,nry3lm,ask,Fri Jun  4 09:09:06 2021,"What are some ways in which the United States is more progressive than other similar countries, such as Canada, Australia, or countries in Europe?","Obviously there's the stereotype about them being backwards and conservative, which I'll admit isn't too far off if you go to the South, the Midwest, the West (excluding the coasts), or for that matter any rural area that's too far from a city. But at the same time I've seen a lot of equally rural areas elsewhere that weren't particularly progressive. I currently live in Seattle, and I've spent a lot of time in both Washington and Oregon, as well is British Columbia and Alberta. Both countries have extremely progressive cities (Seattle, Portland, and Vancouver), while they also have plenty of pretty conservative areas (Eastern Washington, Eastern British Columbia, and just about all of Alberta).

Off hand I know that they're pretty progressive when it comes to legalizing marijuana, as only a handful of countries (Canada included) have made it fully legal, while multiple states have legalized it completely (the federal government is largely under the control of states in the regions I mentioned earlier). Another one is granting citizenship to everyone born within our borders, which is almost unheard of in Europe.

Also there are plenty of people who support universal healthcare, affordable college, (myself included), and many other social and economic changes like the ones that other countries already, so it's not like everybody's content with the status quo (again the federal government is being held hostage by the ultra conservative states).

Also the Dems seem to be pretty good about abortion and gun control, despite their numerous shortcomings elsewhere (I'll admit they aren't a particularly progressive party, maybe center left on a good day, which is why I always vote Green). And same sex marriage was allowed only a little after the average for all other similar countries, only a few years after most of them and a few years before some (again Canada was an outlier, not the norm, also many states allowed it years before the federal government did).

What I've noticed is that the people are pretty mainstream when it comes to social issues, while the conservatives tend to be holding us back on economic issues particularly (although they're behind on a lot, they aren't able to stand in the way of same sex marriage quite the same as they can with universal healthcare or climate action). Meanwhile the liberals (I'm referring to the people, not Biden/Obama/Clinton/etc type career politicians) are pretty much in line with progressives from any other country.

But back to my main question, are some progressive things the United States does that other similar countries don't?",/r/ask/comments/nry3lm/what_are_some_ways_in_which_the_united_states_is/,7
33,nt809n,ask,Sun Jun  6 02:13:56 2021,What do I do?,"My name is Eden. I am an American female from San Francisco who was a foreign exchange student living in Japan for 1 full year. During my time in Tokyo, I met a young beautiful Japanese female named Megumi, who was fluent in English. I developed a crush on her and she turned out to be a lesbian. We then made out with each other and DID IT at her house. We would remain in this relationship for 4 years until I felt that, as lovely as the relationship was, there was something inside of me--a nagging, wrenching, painfully aching hole in my spirit that I KNEW neither she nor any other woman could fill. The relationship felt unfulfilling and ultimately, unsatisfactory, so I eventually broke up with her. In response to this, she slapped me across the face, so hard that she knocked me over the living room couch in her house.

Six years later, I'm in a relationship, with a man named Tetsuya, and a handsome one at that. He has a little sister named Hana, who was being raised by her adult older brother due to them having lost both of their parents in a horrible plane crash shortly after her birth. Our relationship was fantastic--great sex life, great romantic life and amazing intimacy with one another. Best of all, I got to play the role as stepmother to cute little Hana. I had a great, joyous relationship with Tetsuya and Hana, much more fulfilling than any previous relationship I ever had in my life. Life was great until SHE--Megumi came back into my life. She had gotten a job offer--a position to work as a Japanese language professor, in San Francisco, of all places. So we inevitably crossed paths with each other. Megumi sees that I'm in a relationship with a man and jealous of that relationship, she threatens to tell him who I really was. I reject her advances, to which she responds by then showing him AND HIS FOUR-YEAR-OLD SISTER a video of me and her having various sexual encounters with one another during our 4 year relationship at her house in Tokyo.

Believing that I've been cheating on him with this woman, Tetsuya broke up with me.

I......honestly don't know how to react or what to say after that.........I mean, he meant so much to me......and she swiped perhaps the best thing I ever had in my life away from me..........

I think Megumi..........has destroyed my relationship with this man.........What do I do.......? Somebody please tell me what to do.........",/r/ask/comments/nt809n/what_do_i_do/,1
77,oa19bi,ask,Tue Jun 29 07:47:47 2021,"Am unsheltered homeless. After hard sell, considering going into housing as indicated. Advice?","I'm in the United States of America during COVID-19, during which the homeless shelters don't function. I am estranged from my family, leaving me homeless. Some homeless shelters are bad client shelters, where on mornings the clients explode at each other. The others are bad staff shelters, from which staff manufacture an excuse to exit me and exit me because they want to.

I was following directions to food place that would accept my food stamps, now that a lot of food stamp places were closed. I got lost somewhere in the hills of San francisco, and I became hangry. I yelled my speech that humanity is a culture of shame, that the way it views people is based on lies. I went back to Washington square park, where I knew I could scavenge some food off of the ground or out of trash cans. I did so, and rested in the center of the park. A woman woke me up by claiming to be retaking her domain, and what she was actually doing was stealing some of my stuff. I have never performed a sex act in my life. I did not then perform one either. I am innocent. I'm also a teetotaler. The total falsehood of her accusation did not stop her from accusing me of raping her. I warned her that she was mistaking me for someone else. She refused to give me back my stuff, so I complained to the useless Central station police. They ignored her offense, so I grabbed a random one by two off of the street and asked bystanders to leave the park. Then I beat her with the stick, telling her again and again, ""leave this area now or else you will die."" In less than a minute, she went from asleep to gone. I attempted to destroy her stuff.

Then I asked more people to leave the park, claiming to be an armed man and waving the stick above my head. My mistake was likely only this last step, and the police showed up and arrested me. I followed advice on dealing with police and prison, because I'm a homeless man with a disciplined soldier mentality and my meds and nutrition were inadequate. I stood at attention like a soldier. The police told me during the arrest that they were there to help me, and during my term in Sobering that I was being arraigned and that I wouldn't get out of there anytime soon, all of which turned out to be the exact opposite of the truth. The result was approximately 48 unresponsive hours in Sobering, at the end which I told the police that they can release me from the other cell, which is a prisoner holding area for about to release prisoners. I explained that I have a speech disorder, and if I caused a misunderstanding, that's how. The police gave my social worker directions on how I can recover my stuff, the directions also turning out to be the exact opposite of the truth. To this day my efforts to recover my stuff have been a total failure.

I found a clinic officially designed for voluntary psychiatric medicine patients, but eventually one of the clients gave a speech, which was only active shooter red flags for the sake of only active shooter red flags. One of the red flags was said he was paranoid, thinking that staff are playing with him. I too soon realized it was right to be paranoid. One of the staff members told me that she would be a good listener, with unlimited time for any topic in a session later in her office. I got there, and guess whether what she said turned out to be true? She used message discipline to get me into an ADU, and did a rush job. In another session later that night with another staff member, I was silent before that perceived confrontation. Staff eventually suggested to me that my silence was symptomatic of mental illness. I told her, ""that was a really stupid thing that you were probably trained to say, and I don't know if your trainer is telling you lies, but I wish to speak with my attorney first."" I insisted that it was an interrogation, and that I wish to speak with my attorney first. They claimed that the tiny hospital from which I found the clinic recommended the ADU, and then that I went back to the tiny hospital, they did actually want me to get into some sort of navigation center or tax supported housing program.",/r/ask/comments/oa19bi/am_unsheltered_homeless_after_hard_sell/,21

I didn't know what other sub to post it to until I thought of this one.


So, I’m a young Australian bloke that used to watch a lot of Ben Shapiro and Steven Crowder, who effectively acted as my news source on American politics. Something they commonly said is how political commentators or news sources on the Left were just an echo chamber incapable of hearing or seeing the other side. I have since come to the opinion that these guys, and others like them on the Right, are guilty of many of the same type of hypocrisies that they so often accuse those on the Left of committing, and are full of shit. 


These hypocrisies in conservative/republican ideology that I’ve noticed are as follows:

Being on the Right is supposedly about wanting less regulations and Government interference in individuals’ lives. 

And then conservatives favour anti-abortion laws that completely takes the power away from the individual on whether they want to raise an unintended child or not (or even a potential product from rape), and forces children to be born into situations that is both unfavourable for them and their parents.

Furthermore, conservatives favour strict drug laws that puts individuals in jail for putting something into their own body that doesn’t affect anyone else, even completely natural drugs like shrooms. Nevermind that alcohol and cigarettes are completely legal and are unequivocally more harmful to one’s health than a lot of drugs that remain illegal. If people want to take the edge off after a day’s work, they’re forced to pick between legal drugs that kill their bodies and cause cancer, whilst drugs like weed and shrooms, whom nobody has ever died from using ever and can offer many real health benefits, remain mostly illegal.

But of course everyone should be allowed access to guns because it’s their God given right.

“Facts don’t care about your feelings”

And are then mostly religious, despite all the facts pointing towards there not being a God, or at least not one in the way Chrsitianity views it.

Also, people who don’t believe in climate change or global warming will nearly always be on the Right, despite there being a unanimous agreement among the entire world’s scientific community that climate change is real.

Also, gun control in developed western nations does work. Australia had 13 mass shootings with at least five people killed in the 18 years prior to 1996. We had the Port Arthur massacre with 35 dead in 1996, implemented stricter gun laws, and have had ZERO similar mass shootings in the 25 years since. 

I personally find it mind boggling that America averages more mass shootings than days in a year and conservatives view gun control as the devil.

Conservatives are all about freedom of speech and expression, but then favour the Flag Desecration Amendment that makes burning the flag illegal. How this is justified as not being protected by free speech I do not understand.

Conservatives are against gay marriage, but make no fuss about the majority of marriages being between a couple that are not religious and don’t believe in God.

As it’s possible to believe in a Christian God and be gay (as contradictory as you may personally find it), from a religious perspective, surely a couple marrying that don’t believe in God is much more blasphemous than a couple who do believe in God but happen to be of the same sex.

Conservatives want less Government interference and regulations, but Republicans are the ones implementing voter restrictions that makes voting more difficult for many people (just so happens to usually be minorities that aren’t likely to vote Republican, what an odd coincidence).

Conservatives are against restrictions on those not getting the COVID vaccine, and their argument tends to be as follows: An individual’s health is up to them and they should have a right about what goes in their body.

Ok so then why does this logic not apply to using drugs. If an individual wants to smoke weed or consume LSD, how come they should now be thrown in jail or fined? Why can’t they be responsible for their own health and the risks of whatever they want to take?



All in all, I think conservative ideology is riddled with hypocrisy, and I’m interested in how conservatives/Republicans justify or view these hypocrisies that I’ve outlined in this post.

All in all, I think conservative ideology is riddled with hypocrisy, and I’m interested in how conservatives/Republicans justify or view these hypocrisies that I’ve outlined in this post.",/r/ask/comments/p6qq2d/conservativesrepublicans_of_reddit_what_do_you/,7
57,p7d30e,ask,Thu Aug 19 14:36:09 2021,"Conservatives/Republicans of Reddit, what do you think of these perceived hypocrocies in conservative ideology?","So, I’m a 21 year old Australian bloke that used to watch a lot of Ben Shapiro and Steven Crowder, who effectively acted as my news source on American politics. Something they commonly said is how political commentators or news sources on the Left were just an echo chamber incapable of hearing or seeing the other side. I have since come to the opinion that these guys, and others like them on the Right, are guilty of many of the same type of hypocrisies that they so often accuse those on the Left of committing. This is my own personal opinion, not stating it as fact.


These hypocrisies in conservative/republican ideology that I’ve noticed are as follows:

&gt;Being on the Right is supposedly about wanting less regulations and Government interference in individuals’ lives. 

And then conservatives favour anti-abortion laws that completely takes the power away from the individual on whether they want to raise an unintended child or not (or even a potential product from rape), and forces children to be born into situations that is likely both unfavourable for them and their parents.

Furthermore, conservatives favour strict drug laws that puts individuals in jail for putting something into their own body that doesn’t affect anyone else, even completely natural drugs like shrooms. Nevermind that alcohol and cigarettes are completely legal and are unequivocally more harmful to one’s health than a lot of drugs that remain illegal. If people want to take the edge off after a day’s work, they’re forced to pick between legal drugs that kill their bodies and cause cancer, whilst drugs like weed and shrooms, whom nobody has ever died from using ever and can offer many real health benefits, remain mostly illegal.


&gt;“Facts don’t care about your feelings”

And are then mostly religious, despite all the facts that we can prove pointing towards there not being a God, or at least not one in the way Chrsitianity views it. I know faith is different to political beliefs, but most Christians tend to be conservative so there's definitely a correlation in my opinion.

Also, people who don’t believe in climate change or global warming will nearly always be on the Right, despite there being a unanimous agreement among the entire world’s scientific community that climate change is real.

Also, (this is particularly argumentative on my part) gun control in developed western nations does work. Conservatives tend to argue that gun control doesn't work in stopping violence as criminals will be criminals. But in the case of my country, Australia, when there was uniform gun control across the country it certainly did work.

Australia had 13 mass shootings with at least five people killed in the 18 years prior to 1996. We had the Port Arthur massacre with 35 dead in 1996, implemented stricter gun laws, and have had ZERO similar mass shootings in the 25 years since. Those are just the facts as it pertains to Australia, and I personally feel it'd be a similar outcome in America if they adopted similar laws.

&gt;Conservatives are all about freedom of speech and expression, but then favour the Flag Desecration Amendment that makes burning the flag illegal. I know it's about as unpatriotic as one could be to burn your country's flag, but nonetheless, in my opinion, how is this possibly justified as not being protected by free speech.

&gt;Conservatives are against gay marriage, but make no fuss about the majority of marriages being between a couple that are not religious and don’t believe in God.

As it’s possible to believe in a Christian God and be gay (as rare as it is), from a religious perspective, surely a couple marrying that don’t believe in God is much more blasphemous than a couple who do believe in God but happen to be of the same sex.

&gt;Conservatives want less Government interference and regulations, but Republicans are the ones implementing voter restrictions that makes voting more difficult for many people (not just the requirement for Voter ID, I think that's perfectly valid)

&gt;Conservatives are against restrictions on those not getting the COVID vaccine, and their argument tends to be as follows: An individual’s health is up to them and they should have a right about what goes in their body.

Ok, fair enough, so then why does this logic not apply to using drugs. If an individual wants to smoke weed or consume LSD, how come they should now be thrown in jail or fined? Why can’t they be responsible for their own health and the risks of whatever they want to take?



All in all, I personally think conservative ideology contains a lot of hypocrisy, and when I recognised that it persuaded me to no longer believe in conservatism and call myself a conservative like I once did.

94,p9j2p7,ask,Sun Aug 22 22:26:36 2021,What do you guys think of this epilogue?,"The year is 2100. President Joe Dover has implemented a new law with the approval of Congress and the Supreme Court requiring all males ages 18-36 to go to certain facilities known as penis testing centers. There, all of the penises of the males are measured and recorded by researchers. They are also to give their names and location of residences. After the tests have been completed, they are to be submitted to the United States government. There, the data is seperated into 2 groups. The smalls group is where the half of males with the smaller penises are grouped. These people are required by law to travel once again to the penis testing centers for chemical castration and the removal of their penises. The other half, known as the superiors, are the half of the 18-36 year old population with the bigger penises. These people are assigned to a smalls male. This type of relationship is a kind of master-servant relationship. The superiors roles include cucking the smalls person they are assigned to if the smalls male has a spouse/significant other, emasculating their smalls male, and generally controlling the smalls member. “We must maintain physical and sexual greatness within our country. It is our duty to make sure the superiors pass on their stronger genes and grant the next generation superior genitalia.” The citizens of America hear this announcement played once every week from the president himself. Surprisingly, the citizens of America actually seem quite content with the law, and are willing to fulfill their respective duties. At least, thats the case for now…",/r/ask/comments/p9j2p7/what_do_you_guys_think_of_this_epilogue/,3

I don't know the people I asked, they added me as friends years ago and I had spoken to them for years. Male and female, from America, the UK and even Muslim countries.

I was also told that gay men are more opnley disgusted by vaginas than lesbians are by penises, that vaginas are seen as more gross and taboo, more joked about and made fun of while penises are more normalised. (Feminists online always say vaginas are seen negatively, so they must have to get that belief from somewhere)

I was also told women dislike their vaginas more than men dislike their penises (men mostly like or love their own)

I was told anime fans and gamers love feminized men, traps and futa and penises on women or femininity more than women.

I was told it's common for men in Muslim countries to have sex with men before marriage due to gender segregation and sexual repression, and for them to see it as not gay to ""top"" (I only thought it was a small minority who did that, now i'm not so sure.)

And I was told everybody wants to be young, look young and is youth obsessed and that old are seen as inferior and that you look worse and become invisible with age.

35,npw79c,dating_advice,Tue Jun  1 18:09:48 2021,How can a guy flirt in a non-sexual way?,"To preface this, I'm a 22 year old straight American man, with no sexual or dating experience.

I live in a college town with a population of around 80k - 90k people (more than half of that population being college students). The closest larger city to me is an hour away and has about 10 times the population of my college town.

One thing I've seen come up a few times is the issue of flirting to communicate intentions or to foster mutual interest, as people stated [in this recent thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/no7h7h/i_am_so_sick_of_having_dozens_of_dates_where_the/). However, from everything that I can see, [such as in this website's advice someone linked](https://www.nicknotas.com/blog/if-you-arent-flirting-neither-is-she/), I *really* don't like this idea of flirting.

I do not want to communicate sexual interest first, not only because that feels gross, creepy, and uncomfortable to me, but also because I wouldn't want to have sex early in a relationship. I want the start of an interpersonal romantic connection established before sex, probably in part due to lack of experience, but also because I don't feel sexual attraction as immediately as attraction to the person and/or their aesthetic.

I find the idea of being so sex-focused to be impossibly far out of my comfort zone due to my lack of experience, and other things such as ""light touching"" recommended in flirting advice seem so gross and forced to me since ""social touching"" of almost any sort has never been involved in my life or friend groups -- people don't just randomly touch each other.

So, how can a guy, be it on dating apps or in-person or otherwise, flirt in a way that avoids sexual innuendo, comments, etc., while still being effective? Is flirting even necessary? Does flirting necessitate sexual innuendo, and if so, how can I be successful on dating apps or going on dates without flirting while avoiding being seen as ""just a friend""? I want to communicate romantic interest or intention and avoid the problem people fall into of being seen as being too platonic or not causing a ""spark"", especially since I don't have a ton of matches on dating apps.",/r/dating_advice/comments/npw79c/how_can_a_guy_flirt_in_a_nonsexual_way/,7

50,o01dfb,dating_advice,Tue Jun 15 03:37:25 2021,I (F24) have no idea where he (M21) stands - randomly mean or nice for no reason.," I started seeing a guy who's got the same uni job as me, we both work in a hospitality venue and see each other several times a week. We were vibing for a long time before we even hung out, which was like a month ago. Since then we hang out weekly, and this weekend we stayed together all weekend from Friday night til Sunday night.

Obviously not the most romantic setup, I graduate in a month and he's got a year left. I will be moving to USA in September for a graduate course (were both in EU). I'm 2 years older than him.

Anyway, I think he knows its a casual setup. It's only been about a month.

We have a lot of sex... At first we went out and stuff but for the last 2 weeks mostly just having sex. He is more affectionate and we do just kiss randomly now rather than just during sex. He says stuff like I'm the best sex he's had by far and saying stuff like ""wouldn't it be funny if we had a long distance relationship?"" and stuff like ""I'll call you when you're all important in America to see if you remember me"".

He also says stuff like I'm hard to understand/work out and that I'm mysterious, and that he doesn't know how to take me sometimes.

At the same time I feel like he's constantly trying to generate some kind of response from me. He'll say things like ""got so many tinder messages to reply to"" or stuff like ""oh stacey reckons me you and her should have a threesome"" said as jokes, but also not really. Other stuff includes ""I flirt with one girl everyday"". In front of other people he will say stuff like call me babe/baby and I don't like it. But then at the same time says I'm weird for having a picture of my ex on my instagram even tho we only broke up a few months ago.

So aside from the sex thing, we see each other in work. Sometimes he's quite moody and stuff but mostly it's fine. He does get my gifts sometimes, and we usually text each other daily (when not in work).

I made a joke in work to him and he took it the wrong way a couple of weeks ago. He didn't speak to me for the rest of the shift. I even text him saying that I was sorry if he was hurt. He didn't reply for 3 days. In fact he didn't really reply at all, but came up to me in work like everything was cool. When I mentioned it to him he said ""oh yeah I wasn't even bothered, I just wanted to see how long I could keep up not talking to you for"".... Cool?

Recently I've found that he's well less responsive over text. Sometimes he will be active on Facebook and just ignore my text for no reason for like 8 hours. Other times he responds in like 2 minutes?

When I am with him he does seem to be on his phone semi regularly, not excessively, but definitely on his phone enough to respond to his friends texts if he wants too. So in my mind he's definitely seen my text and chosen not to reply...

It's frustrating because he basically admitted he withheld contact with me to see if he could... Isn't that manipulative? And I don't get the whole vibe of trying to joke about us being in a LDR and at the same time mention other girls?",/r/dating_advice/comments/o01dfb/i_f24_have_no_idea_where_he_m21_stands_randomly/,0
89,o0o5x5,dating_advice,Tue Jun 15 23:45:41 2021,"WARNING: LONG READ [21M] Feeling insecure about my [21F] girlfriend who is studying abroad, told me she doesn't feel emotionally supported anymore.","My girlfriend and I have been dating for almost a year and a half now, and we attend the same university. We get along well together and consider each other best friends as well as gf/bf. I love her so much for every aspect of her being. She is stunningly beautiful, smart, and an extremely outgoing, charming woman. The depth of my admiration for her could not be adequately expressed in writing. On the other hand, I feel like I am lacking in the personality department. I am quite reserved but friendly and personable in one-on-one interactions with people. I get anxious a lot and suffer from mild anxiety attacks every once in a while.  In a previous relationship, my ex had cheated on me and essentially screwed my trust in people. I didn't date anyone for two years until I met my current gf. It took some time to get used to dating again because I still had trust issues.

 I regrettably snooped through her phone about 3 months after asking her out. Found conversations with an ex-bf that lasted one month into our relationship, and another conversation with a guy she sexted with in the past who told her he was in town while we were still in the ""talking"" stage, although we were official the following week. Obviously I was upset, but I knew that I had gone through her phone and invaded her privacy. I confronted/confessed to her what I had done and found, and she confessed that she wasn't seeking intimacy from either of them but instead wanted attention because she didn't know how serious our relationship would become at such an early stage. Neither of the conversations --during the time that were talking or dating-- were frisky or otherwise suggested infidelity, but I never forgot that she was seeking attention from other men so casually. 

We have had several fights in the past. Last fall, she went through a really tough time with depression and anxiety due to a multitude of problems stimming from childhood neglect. I did my best to support her and ease her emotional distress, but I couldn't ""fix"" her. She pushed off therapy for a while, and her problems got worse to the point that she started taking it out on me. I put up with it for a few months, but eventually I was fed up with the berating accusations of not loving her enough, not spending enough time with her, having friends that laugh at her, etc.. None of those comments were true but it seemed like the byproduct of her anxiety. She was also prescribed to Wellbutrin, an anti-anxiety medication, that made her feel like shit all the time and essentially provided the opposite effects of its original purpose. I broke up with her in November because she refused to get help and I could no longer stand dealing with her problems. Fast forward to Christmas break, we met to catch up, and she told me how sorry she was and that she started seeing a counselor. She also said that she was diagnosed with ADHD and that some of her anxious and depressive symptoms were due to the wrong meds making her bipolar. Over the next week we got back together because I could tell that she was sincere in trying to improve herself and knew that she *wanted* to get professional help. 

Things were getting better, not perfect but not as bad as they once were. That was until February of this year. At the beginning of the year, I began intensively studying for the DAT, an American dental school admissions test (MCAT version for dental school), while also being a full-time student. We agreed that I would be spending a large chunk of my time studying for it, but we would still make time for each other. We spent most weekends together either watching movies at home or going to parties. I didn't take her out on a lot of dinner dates or daytime activities in the city, but I did occasionally and tried to make the best of what I had, given that I don't have a lot of money. FYI, I do come from a wealthy family, and my parents pay for my tuition and insurance but I never ask them for money/allowance or anything of that nature. I myself am not a rich man. February was the month of our Anniversary, too, and my girlfriend told me that we didn't need to do anything major, all she wanted was to eat out, no gifts. I feel so stupid now, but in the moment I took that as nothing but going out to eat and enjoying each other's presence. We got dinner at a burger joint, and everything seemed fine and we were genuinely having a good time. She wrote me a love letter and gave it to me after dinner, but I didn't have one to give her. I could tell she was upset and I apologized extensively for not writing her one back. She shrugged it off and we spent the night at my house. The next morning was absolutely bewildering. 

I woke up and noticed that she was in the bathroom. I could hear her crying inside and I asked her what was wrong. Her words were unintelligible from her sobbing . I tried to let myself in, but the door was locked. I stood outside for half an hour trying to get her to open the door but she wouldn't budge and she just kept repeating how worthless she was. I finally got the key to the door and let myself in. She was sitting on the floor, shower curtain pulled to the ground, soap bottles were all over. It was a wreck. I sat down next to her and finally got her to tell me that once again, she felt like I didn't love her enough. All the memories of what happened in the fall started to flutter in my head. I defended myself telling her how much I loved her, apologized for not writing her a letter or getting her flowers or expressing my love for her enough, but she didn't want to hear it. She finally suggested that maybe we weren't meant for each other. I wanted to scream and cry, but I agreed. I felt like all I made were mistakes in the relationship. Right after that she started bawling again, clinging onto me and begging me not to leave her. Her change in emotion was a rollercoaster, and in my head I knew that no matter how hard I tried to be a good boyfriend, there was always going to be something that would throw a wrench in the spokes. I really did not see our relationship lasting at that moment, especially with the intensity of my studies for my future. I still wanted to be there and comfort her, but at that moment I did not see a future if she was going to continue being in this state of emotion. 

To be completely honest, I couldn't tell if her actions and feelings were true or if they were manipulation. With my ex, she faked a suicide attempt before to get me to come see her, along with constant lying, betrayal, etc.. I know they are two different people, but it seemed along the same trend at the time and from my experience. 

I let her stay at the house and we laid in bed together all day. I remember holding her in my arms. She couldn't stop crying. She kept telling me how she was going to get better, and I wanted to believe her but I couldn't. I told her the worst possible thing to say in that moment: ""I just don't see a future with you anymore."" Never in my life have I ever regretted saying something more than that. She broke down into a hopeless mess. It was terrible, and I felt terrible. I didn't know what to do. Every ounce of my fear and resentment left my mind. I knew this girl wasn't trying to guilt trip me or make me be some fucking slave to her or whatever idea I had going on inside of my head. I felt so stupid, so incompetent to the thought of love. It snowed  that night, and I remember the cold inside the room exaggerating the freezing atmosphere we shared emotionally. 

Long story short, we talked everything out and continued dating into the summer. She left to study abroad for a month two weeks ago. We told each other that we would talk every day, which we have, and for the first week it was fine. She usually goes out with her group of 11 other female students at night, getting dinner at restaurants in her city in Bulgaria. They also go out to clubs 4-5 times out of the week. I didn't have a problem with her going out to bars and drinking. Although I am insecure, I also know that she is on that trip to have fun and enjoy the experience of a lifetime, so I didn't want to bug her with complaints and ruin her experience, and for the most part I trust her. We agreed to call/text each other routinely around the same time of day, midnight her time and 4 o'clock mine. One night she went out with her group, and they ended up at a hookah bar. She told me how much fun she was having, how much she missed me and how much she wanted to jump my bones when she came home. I enjoyed listening to it for obvious reasons, but then she told me that she and some friends got into a hookah circle with a group of local men, and apparently two of the girls made out with them. I felt very uncomfortable when she told me that, but I didn't think that she was one of those girls. The next day I asked about her plans for the night. She told me how it went, and that she was planning on going out with her girl friend, just the two of them. I was happy that she was making friends and didn't think anything of it. Around the time we usually called each other, I rang her but she didn't answer. She always answers her phone, so I was a little concerned but not seriously freaked out. It was about midnight over there, but she usually stayed out until 3 or 4 in the morning. I sent her a text asking to call me back, and she promptly responded that she would soon. For the next 4 hours, I got no calls, no text, nothing. Admittedly, I called her out over text and asked what she was doing. Still, no text.  She finally called back when she got home at 4:30.  She said that she was busy texting a victim of sexual assault. Note that she is the president of our campus's Sexual Assault Awareness Society. My frustration lowered, but I was still upset that she didn't at least tell me what she was doing or that she was busy. I told her that I was worried about her and that it would have taken zero effort to shoot me a text since she was already on her phone. I started thinking about the night before, too, and told her how I was uncomfortable with her being around guys I didn't know, especially since her friends were making out with them. Perhaps this was a jab at the trust in our relationship. She told me that she wasn't my ex and that she doesn't sleep around, but that she would be more responsive to keeping me updated with what she was doing or if she was busy. We ended the conversation abruptly afterwards. The next day (night for her), after very infrequent texts, I called her again around the same time as the day before. No answer, again, but this time the call tone was cut short so I knew she declined the call. I texted her asking to call me back. After an hour of waiting, I called again--declined again. I was quite upset at this point. I would have understood if she didn't want to talk because she was out with friends, but I wish she would've had the decency to at least let me know, like we had agreed upon the day before. I started to call her consecutively for about 5 minutes, and finally I got a text saying I upset her the night before. ""I'm not your fucking ex"" was the latter message. I tried to explain to her that I understood she wasn't, and that I kept calling because I wanted to know if she was safe, but deep inside I knew that was a lie. I really was worried about what she was doing because she is 6500 miles away and has no obligation to me. I didn't have to tell her that for her to know how I was feeling. Still never called me back. We share each other's location on iCloud, and I checked to see where she was, which I continued to do for 3 hours straight. I understand this is obsessive behavior, but I was properly freaking out. She was out in town, and stayed at the same building for 2 hours until they got home at 4 in the morning. No communication the next day. I was beginning to think my fears were becoming true. I waited the evening to check her location again, and she was out again. Around 1 AM, she went back to the same building, but this time she stayed there long enough for me to figure out she was staying the night. I couldn't help but convince myself that she was cheating. I called her, begged her to let me talk to her. She answered and told me we had a lot to talk about. I could hear opening of cabinets and doors in the background, so I knew someone else was there with her. I asked who it was, and she said it was a girl who she met at the local university they both study at. Apparently they went out together, checked out her apartment the night before, and stayed the night that night. I have not seen any pictures of them together, so what she said might be true, or it might not. I asked her what was wrong and why she was ghosting me, and she said she didn't feel like she was being emotionally supported anymore, and specifically included it was a reason she didn't want to have sex anymore. 

The next day we talked and she explained how over the past six months I haven't made effort to spend quality time with her, made romantic dinners, wrote love letters to her. She brought up our anniversary date, and gnawed on the love letter situation as well as me telling her I didn't see a future with her anymore. Although I have apologized for all of those things many times now, she chose to bring up all these problems conveniently again while she is in a foreign country. She said that she still loved me, and that she wants to make things work, but she doesn't feel the emotional connection we once had. She said that when I was sending intimate texts to her a few nights before all of this, she dreaded the thought of having sex with me. That absolutely crushed me. I had time to recognize my own insecurities and I do understand that essentially accusing her of cheating was wrong. I am currently seeing a therapist to handle my insecurities, but I have trouble identifying why my thoughts are invalid regarding my girlfriend's recent actions. We are still together, but this week has been really weird since we had that conversation. Our texts are somewhat back to normal, and she still calls me ""babe"" and tells me she misses and loves me. She believes that I can change, but she has to see the results before she can make any major decisions. Yesterday she told me she met a group of locals who introduced herself. One of them was an Italian guy, who I later looked up to be a tall, handsome model. They were all very nice according to her, which makes sense as she is very beautiful and social. About halfway through our conversation, she told me that he had invited her and ""her group"" out to lunch today, and to party tonight. I had to pry to get much information out of her about him, and I felt like a fool doing so because of everything that happened in the past week, but I don't even know what to feel anymore. I'm torn because I love this girl so much, even through all of the hardships in the relationship, and I want to make it work with her, but I don't know if it is too late. If it is, I just wish she would tell me instead of stringing me along while she finds that lost emotional connection with some local. I just want closure. I want to be confident again. I want the love of my life back. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; 

I have been dating a girl for 1.5 years. We have had our ups and downs as any relationship does. I had an ex who cheated on me, still have trust issues because of it. Found questionable conversations with old flames in current gf's phone 3 months into the relationship. Now she's on a study abroad trip in Bulgaria, goes out to bars frequently every week. Contact has been minimal due to mutual agreement, but slim to none for a few days after I partially accused her of cheating. Called her one night with no answer and multiple declines. Found out she spent the night at another apartment different from the one she lives at via Find My Phone. Talked to her about it later, she said it's her female friend from the local university but she might be lying. Goes on to tell me she doesn't feel emotionally supported and that she is revolted by the thought of having sex with me. We talked it out and she didn't break up with me, but things are different now. She still says she loves me and misses me, but has been meeting a lot of guys on the trip. Met an Italian model who she nonchalantly talks about, asked her and ""her friends"" out to lunch and to party during the night today. She declined both but it is evident that she's trading numbers with other men outside of our relationship. She even talked about their texting conversation too. I don't know if he is the only guy she is talking to, but this is the only one she has brought up. I want to trust her but my insecurity has gotten the best of me. I want closure, but I know I won't get any until she gets back.",/r/dating_advice/comments/o0o5x5/warning_long_read_21m_feeling_insecure_about_my/,10
94,o0rm7h,dating_advice,Wed Jun 16 02:36:41 2021,Is it normal for FWBs to act like this? Feels weird," 

Basically I started seeing a guy who's got the same uni job as me, we both work in a hospitality venue and see each other several times a week. We were vibing for a long time before we even hung out, which was like a month ago. i am a very chilled person. ive never brought up any issues, argued with him, ignored him or attempted to make him jealous.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then we hang out weekly, and this weekend we stayed together all weekend from Friday night til Sunday night.

Obviously not the most romantic setup, I graduate in a month and he's got a year left. I will be moving to USA in September for a graduate course (were both in EU). I'm 2 years older than him.

Anyway, I think he knows its a casual setup. It's only been about a month.

We have a lot of sex... At first we went out and stuff but for the last 2 weeks mostly just having sex. He is more affectionate and we do just kiss randomly now rather than just during sex. He says stuff like I'm the best sex he's had by far and saying stuff like ""wouldn't it be funny if we had a long distance relationship?"" and stuff like ""I'll call you when you're all important in America to see if you remember me"".

He also says stuff like I'm hard to understand/work out and that I'm mysterious, and that he doesn't know how to take me sometimes.

At the same time I feel like he's constantly trying to generate some kind of response from me. He'll say things like ""got so many tinder messages to reply to"" or stuff like ""oh stacey reckons me you and her should have a threesome"" said as jokes, but also not really. Other stuff includes ""I flirt with one girl everyday"". In front of other people he will say stuff like call me babe/baby and I don't like it. But then at the same time says I'm weird for having a picture of my ex on my instagram even tho we only broke up a few months ago.

So aside from the sex thing, we see each other in work. Sometimes he's quite moody and stuff but mostly it's fine. He does get my gifts sometimes, and we usually text each other daily (when not in work).

I made a joke in work to him and he took it the wrong way a couple of weeks ago. He didn't speak to me for the rest of the shift. I even text him saying that I was sorry if he was hurt. He didn't reply for 3 days. In fact he didn't really reply at all, but came up to me in work like everything was cool. When I mentioned it to him he said ""oh yeah I wasn't even bothered, I just wanted to see how long I could keep up not talking to you for"".... Cool?

Recently I've found that he's well less responsive over text. Sometimes he will be active on Facebook and just ignore my text for no reason for like 8 hours. Other times he responds in like 2 minutes?

When I am with him he does seem to be on his phone semi regularly, not excessively, but definitely on his phone enough to respond to his friends texts if he wants too. So in my mind he's definitely seen my text and chosen not to reply...

It's frustrating because he basically admitted he withheld contact with me to see if he could... Isn't that manipulative? And I don't get the whole vibe of trying to joke about us being in a LDR and at the same time mention other girls?",/r/dating_advice/comments/o0rm7h/is_it_normal_for_fwbs_to_act_like_this_feels_weird/,4

It'll be about a 4-5 hour trip there, but I've REALLY wanted to have a mini vacation in NYC. I'm a woman btw, how would you plan this out?

He's got everything planned in terms of activities during the date, but I can't decide if I want to get a hotel and spend the night or not. It'll be our first date technically so I'm not sure if we'll sleep together, but I really want to lol. On the other hand, a fun little day in the city sounds so wonderful and casual. I'm also not sure if he's even ready for sex or to spend the night, as he's been taking things super slowly and has explained why, which I completely respect. He's been accelerating things emotionally though and I definitely want to take the next step soon! 

Anyone had experience with out of town dates? I know it's a pretty weird first date idea but we've been discussing this for over a month and are of course both super into NYC :)",/r/dating_advice/comments/o4a2br/how_would_you_plan_an_out_of_town_date/,4
24,o4fhmq,dating_advice,Mon Jun 21 00:25:40 2021,Am I (F28) overthinking feelings for a friend (M27) overseas?,"
Hey guys, would really appreciate some advice on this major crush I’ve had for years on a former colleague who lives in America, but I’m going to be relocating to that city in about 9 months. I’ve also posted in relationship advice !

I travelled to America about 2.5 years ago start of 2019 for a conference and we met, while on the same global graduate programme. We hit it off and through my jet lag remember thinking god he’s hot, we hit it off well that week and he followed me on Instagram and we kept in touch from there. Separately I came home from that trip thinking I’d love to live there, and started to pursue that internally. (Agreed on a timeline in the end with my manager prior to covid which held things up but we’re committed to applying for a visa later in the year finally) 4 months later he visited Europe for work and a few of us went on a mini break there- he told me he thought I was hot after we spent a night drinking and flirting but he was exclusively dating back home so nothing happened. We knew we’d see each other again that summer again for a work trip that summer where a bunch of us made it into a three week trip. We hooked up a few times on that trip and had sex once just- never spoke about what anything meant ever and it was always after drinking 

We both went home but he had arranged before this holiday to visit over here that Christmas, so he came here for about a week and travelled around and we kissed on New Years. Since he left I was dating someone else actually and we stayed in touch but not really flirty anymore and didn’t discuss our dating lives at all! He was also briefly in a relationship during the last year. We’re both single now and we’re back in touch on a semi regular basis, he knows I’m gearing up to move to his city through work early next year and is pumped, and we’ve had a number of video calls in the last few months also to catch up. (Since I’ve become single again) 

It’s interesting to me that whenever we do see each in other person it’s always with an undertone of more than friends, but we haven’t had a convo about anything since that very first one haha and obviously no point at all when I live in a completely different time zone and side of the world. 

Am I totally overthinking our friendship here? Since I’ve met him he’s pretty much popped into my head every day, even throughout a year long relationship. And I also think he’s the sexiest man I’ve ever seen lol. 

TL;DR (sorry this was a long rant lol) crush on a guy who was previously a colleague (he’s left my company now) who lives abroad / we hooked up a few times over the years but I’m getting transferred to his city / country and want advice if I’m super in love or super over thinking :)",/r/dating_advice/comments/o4fhmq/am_i_f28_overthinking_feelings_for_a_friend_m27/,5
11,o5lwyh,dating_advice,Tue Jun 22 15:25:41 2021,How do I do this mess!? I'm tired 🤣😭,"24M from NYC here. Starting to get really tired of trying to date. I would like to think I'm a cool enough person but I suppose I haven't had anyone intrigued enough by my existence to properly test that theory. 

I've been assiduously working on improving myself and have become a person of better judgment and greater conviction, overall better than I was yesterday, but still not perfect. I still have much room to grow and would like to share that experience with someone. But here's my problem...

I'm very introverted, but I do believe I wouldn't have very much issue with talking to women, but the thought of actually putting myself out there is a bit overwhelming. How do I fix this? 

Also as controversial as this may be, is it inappropriate to not wait for sex for a long time? That's not to say that I don't or won't wait at all, but after a certain period of time I begin to lose interest. In my experience the best people in my life have been the ones who've been open with me intimately from the beginning or near beginning. The ones I've had to wait for, especially for a prolonged period of time have always disappointed me.   Is there perhaps a middle ground I'm not aware of yet?

9,o6si7b,dating_advice,Thu Jun 24 06:21:08 2021,I need honest feedback,"28 year old African American male, introverted, social at times, not a drinker, only every blue moon I'll have a few drinks, but it's definitely not a go to for me.

Tonight, I was minding my own business watching some Hulu, when my friend that stays next to me came by. A bunch of people we know from work showed up to my crib, they had been drinking so they were loose, and a little wild and wanted to come by and hang out. Two particular girls from work that I'm cool with came with a few guys we're all associated with. 

My friend said hey, y'all want a fuckin beer? They all agreed saying he'll yeah, and the evening began. One of the two girls, I know from work came straight up to me and started flirting, though she had been drinking, I didn't take her advances seriously at all, and I do not like engaging in sexual verbiage or behavior when a woman is intoxicated, it's just not my thing, and is kind of a turn off for me.

Anyway she was flirting a lot and she was definitely throwing me sexual signals, and I couldn't help but think I speak to her at work, but barely, only small talk and I keep it moving. Out of all the guys there she singled me out, and was focused only on me the entire night.

I'm 28, and this girl has to be probably 19 or 20 years old, not really my thing talking to women that young, yes she's attractive, at least to me she is, but I don't really entertain women that young. Everyone wanted me to drink, I kept blowing it off, and when people realized I'm ""one of those guys"" that don't drink and wild, the energy shifted completely away from me, to my buddy since he drinks, and I pretty much got singled out the rest of the night, they all went to his place next door. The girl threw me more signals but I brushed her off and she went with the others.
She even said ""I'll remember that"".

28 years old and I still ask myself, does it really take drinking and getting drunk and wild just to be social? And not gonna lie the girl was attractive, and at work she always speaks to me first, even when in passing. I can't help it that being around crowds of people who are drunk and loud makes me want to disappear, I just don't like being around it for too long, but everyone else I know thrives in these situations.

Maybe it's the fact I'm getting older, but I honestly don't know.",/r/dating_advice/comments/o6si7b/i_need_honest_feedback/,12
42,o76vxe,dating_advice,Thu Jun 24 21:27:27 2021,"35-yr-old Single female, Never been in a relationship","So yeah. I’ve never been in a relationship or dated anyone. Reason being it was a taboo to have a bf growing up. Anyway, I love my family. Both me and my sister are fiercely independent, but I never developed an healthy view of adult relationships. Sex before marriage is a big no-no. This warrants a whole other post, but in this post, I seek your advise on how to proceed with this guy (29) I met.

I went kayaking through a meetup group. We were out of single kayaks and this guy offered to be my partner for a tandem kayak. It was so much fun. He was being a total gentleman, did all the heavy lifting (it was my first time and he’s a regular) he was also flirting a wee bit but in a harmless kind of way. In the end he asked for my number and wanted to meet for coffee. Although I had a good time, it wasn’t easy for me, but I did agree. 

So we met for coffee. Easily spent a few hours. Again decided to meet up the following day. This time we rented bikes, picked a nice spot, he had packed some vegan juice, fruits and all that. He literally did everything for me from unpacking the food, to throwing away the rubbish, to parking my bike, guiding me as we were walking - no ones treated me this way. Is it the North American dating culture in general or is it just him? ( I do have a guy friend who treats me this way to an extent but we are just friends who behave like a 60-yr-old couple. This again is whole other post)

He asked me out on a dinner date. The weird person that I am, I said no I don’t do dates. Never been in a relationship and all that. He was visibly upset. But he also opened up about how hard it is to find dates. Then, I said maybe he should try online dating and all that. On our way back, I did initiate arm holding, cause I was conflicted and I wasn’t so sure. We then held hands for a few minutes but it was too weird for me. I mean I did like him but it was also weird so I pulled back. Anyway he dropped me back home and he kinda seemed pissed off.

The following day I asked for his Instagram handle. He has 4 followers and 20 posts. Out of the 4, 2 are South Asian women and the other is Caucasian woman. This freaked me out. How do you know if this a genuine profile? What if he’s married or committed? So I asked if he approaches only south Asian women (I’m south Asian) whom he meets in meetup groups. I remember the other 2 girls from a meetup group. To which he replied, one has a bf and the other is married, the Caucasian is his cousin and his account is new ( I remember him saying that earlier) I said if that’s true then I’m sorry.

Now I see that he is not as interested. I’ve texted him a few times. He responds after a few hours. He did say it was a busy week. I asked if we could go for a movie night, he’s picked a date that’s 2 weeks from now. I transferred my share for the movie ticket and for other things too. I’ve stopped texting although I want to. Like I don’t want to do anything serious. I do like hanging out with him. Casual sex is a big no-no for me. On the other hand, I’m also afraid that this might be a facade and he just wants to get into my pants.

51,o7d5oe,dating_advice,Fri Jun 25 03:59:27 2021,"Anxiety and depression prevent me from dating, but that lack of dating gives me anxiety and depression.","I'm a 38 year old straight male in Australia. All of my best friends have moved interstate or overseas or have died in recent years.

Anxiety and depression make it very very difficult for me to be dating, but that lack of dating, sex, intimacy, meaningful relationships, etc. - gives me anxiety and depression.

Put simply I have a lifelong phobia of rejection and now it's been almost 4 years since I last had a girlfriend.
All of my girlfriends ended up having ulterior motives for dating me too, which sucks. 

I've basically recovered from social anxiety disorder and avoidant personality disorder years ago now; but I've been seeing stuff in the news recently about how many people simply refuse to date anyone with depression and so I've been wanting to write about this stuff properly recently and get some advice.

I've been obsessively working on fixing my mental health for years including therapy and antidepressants which reached a point where they can't help any further. 

What I need to get healthy is something that doesn't exist: some sort of exposure therapy for approach anxiety, rejection and being able to recover from that without a rejection destabilising my mental health.

I've tried meetup groups, tried going out by myself to live music gigs, I've checked out the various pubs and bars near me. No luck. A complete waste of my time and money.
My friends over the years have been entirely unhelpful. I've not once been introduced to single friend to get to know, for example...

55,o7f8li,dating_advice,Fri Jun 25 06:12:57 2021,I Need Strategies To Combat The Negative Thoughts In My Head Telling Me I’m Incapable Of Dating,"First, stuff about me to get an idea of who I am. Strictly on the physical level, I’m about to turn 23 in a couple of months, 5’8, Vietnamese, 130 pounds, straight black hair, brown skin, glasses, the whole works. I posted my pics on r/amiugly and I was told that my style of clothing is genuinely nice and multiple constructive critiques told me to simply work out and buff my muscles. I’m doing that every other day. 

Personality-wise, and I understand that my personality is subjective depending on who’s interacting with me: I’m an introvert-until-I-open-up, funny, intelligent, introspective, I remember minute details about friends, hard-working, creative, and proactive. 

I feel like I identified my weaknesses which directly impacted my dating inexperience: I was a people pleaser, a pushover, a doormat, subservient, timid, spineless, awkward, passive, insecure. These traits all go hand in hand to say that I’m a man who WAS needy. I’m re-reading “Models” by Mark Manson and he made it clear that neediness is a turn-off for people, especially needy men for women in this context. I’m in therapy, on meds, I’m journaling, and I’m reading self-help all as ways to focus on myself. 

I say I “Was” these things because of my other problem: I haven’t interacted 1-on-1 IRL with a girl since May 2019. I graduated from university in June 2019 and worked remotely from then and up to now (obviously the pandemic exacerbated things.) All my IRL socializing friends are guys, not counting a few of their girlfriends, and that’s that. I haven’t had any interactions with girls so it’s a no-brainer why I squandered, like, 9% of my life that I could’ve spent gaining experience with the opposite sex. 

When it comes to girls and dating, I am a virgin who’s never held hands, obtained a phone number, or kissed a girl. It doesn’t bother me day-to-day but it does peeve me when I stay up at night, unable to sleep, and I consider all the potential time I could’ve had in a relationship or at least seeing a girl that I squandered while other men my age are fulfilling their desires due to their competence in this department. 

Now that you know all that, I’ll explain the purpose of this post. I have to actively choose each day to tackle life with a positive attitude and shackle my negativity in my brain to keep it from ruining my day. I don’t believe it can ever be cured but my willpower can keep it at bay. 

However, I’m here asking for strategies to better combat the negative thoughts I have that tell me I am never going to date or have a relationship. This is due to these thoughts using hard facts and data as evidence to back up the idea that I’ll stay lonely forever. In other words, common knowledge that is present all over the internet supports the negative chunk of my brain and gives it a stronger voice in my head. 

I’m talking about the following: Asian men have it hardest on dating apps by a large margin. No one can argue with that. Western media emasculates Asian American men to feminize them which is subconsciously in the mind of many women. Darker-skinned men experience less dating success on the online landscape. So do short men, and so do men with lesser amounts of strength. So combined, as a shorter, darker-skinned, scrawnier Asian American man, these facts that are mostly (besides physical strength) unchangeable ruin my day. 
 
Also, adult virgins into their 20s face a lot of rejection that snowballs into longer-lasting rejection due to their inexperience, the reluctance to be an older person’s first, and the preference to sleep with someone who knows what they are doing. These sensible reasons make me feel like I have less hope than others due to my celibacy. As if that’s not enough, it’s exponentially worse since I’ve never kissed a girl. I don’t know any girl my age who’s willing to walk a grown man through the motions of basic relationship/intimacy that a high-school boy can be well-versed in. 

So I improve myself and I mentally reinforce my willpower to push through so as to better my life. I keep moving forward. But it’s these soul-crushing flaws that are able to break me down and make me think that all my efforts are for nothing. Like, it makes me think I’ll never meet a woman who’ll tolerate AND be enthused to go out and connect with a 5’8, skinny, brown, Asian virgin who’s never kissed a girl at nearly 23. 
 
So to anybody who reads this: Thank you. And I have some questions to ask. 

How can I fight against these depressing thoughts in my head? 

How do you do it? 

Is it worth it for me in my specific situation to work hard to beat my odds or am I just a bit too unlucky?

Are my negative thoughts valid to some degree?

How can I convince myself that each and every one of my unconventional qualities is desirable to women?",/r/dating_advice/comments/o7f8li/i_need_strategies_to_combat_the_negative_thoughts/,2
93,o816rg,dating_advice,Sat Jun 26 04:37:04 2021,[long post pls read] Am I (f21) being stupid wanting to still stick around?,"first off, i thought i could handle doing stuff with dudes without any labels or dating. but i guess i was wrong. 

end of january this year, i met this guy (m23) on tinder. i didn’t really like him at first when he was messaging me but i gave my snapchat to him and we talked there. 

we had our first date about 5 days later. i was nervous because i had just broken up with my ex like 6 months ago, but my friends told me to just go for it. and i did and i’m glad i did. it was the best first date i’ve ever had in my life. 

we had our second date two days later, had him over my apartment and we watched movies &amp; then hooked up. i felt a really good connection between us and it was just so nice! we had the same college major, interest in music/movies/shows and we were just like best friends. 

i denied my feelings for him for weeks but my roommates told me it’s obvious that he really likes me and that i seem to feel the same too but i just don’t know it yet. he took me bowling and go karting and we spent so many nights together, talking and having sex. then one night i asked him to come pick me up from a bar and he did. i asked him to bring me to sonic to get me some milkshakes but they were closed for some reason. we were on the way home in his car when we stopped at a stoplight. he held my hand and kisses the back of it. that’s when i realized i liked him. that was march. 

i had surgery at the end of march and had to go home to my parents for a week to recover. we were texting and facetiming the whole time. we were playing apex together and stuff like that. it was just really nice. he took care of me basically when i came back to my apartment while still recovering. it was really sweet of him. 

i finally told him end of april i liked him. it was the 3rd month we were talking. this was how the conversation went in my car:

me: so what are we?


him: *took him a while to answer*


finally, he answers: “well my brother and i are planning on moving to texas (we’re in new england) about next year so if this gets serious…” 


me: oh ok..


him: my brother flakes a lot so it might not happen. 


me: ok so u want me to wait?


him: yes….? well you’ve been waiting for 3 months so i guess… it’s up to you.


okay so now i didn’t know what to do. i just knew then that this is never gonna happen and it’s not gonna go anywhere. 

fast forward first of may, i was at a friend’s bday party and got too drunk. had to ask him to give me a ride at 3am, and he came. 

he brought me home. walked me to my room, set my bed up, tucked me in and kissed me good night. he was really cool about it. he also looked like he was in bed before i texted cause he was sleepy. 

had the same talk the next day when he picked me up because his family was having a fight late at midnight. we went to sonic and ate food at my house, cuddled and talked about it. this is how it went:

me: so what’s going on now?


him: things still hasn’t changed. 


me: meaning?


him: i’m still planning on moving to texas.. so it would be unfair of me to ask you not to see other people 


me: *dumb* i don’t want to see other people 


him: good!! 

we still acted like a couple and all that after. during memorial weekend, he had to go to florida for a trip with his friends. i kinda thought it’d be over by then! miami is the national HOE state of America. i expected him to text me on monday and be like “hey it’s over i fucked someone here” but no 

when he was there, he was texting me and snap chatting me the whole time, showing me what the house he stayed in look like and all the clubs he went to 

he facetimed me that sunday at like 11:30 while i was playing monopoly with my friends (lol) and he was telling me how he misses me. (t/n: i hadn’t seen him for over a week then because i was at the hospital few days before he had to go on the trip it was a bad week lol). he was saying how he wanted to take a trip/vacation with me and all that. i was surprised because i didn’t think he liked me like that. 

fast forward beginning of june, i talked to him again. this is how the conversation went:

me: so what do you want from me?


him: *took him a long time to answer again*


me: wow it’s that complicated of a question? *in a joking way* have you never thought about it before or something?


him: oh no i definitely have. i’m just trying to say it into words that’s all


me: ok 


him: *finally answers* im still moving to texas and my plan still stands… look we can still do whatever we’re doing now, i’d be loyal to you and even when we would be in a “relationship” right now i’d still be doing the same things with you… so ..


me: ok so am i wasting my time or?


him: i wouldn’t say ur wasting ur time. but if you’re looking for like a relationship, i… guess you are

me: oh okay, 

him: well it’s up to you basically. i’d stay loyal to you and all that, won’t be talking to anyone. the balls in ur court. 

so okay, looking back to all that has happened. wow. okay. why would he be doing everything and spending his time and money on me if he doesn’t want a relationship? because i think that’s just dumb

now i finally have the guts to get out of this situation. my peace is literally bothered all the time. i always get so nervous and anxious because him and i aren’t official and i don’t want to look stupid doing girlfriend stuff… what are ur opinions!

anyway TLDR; i finally had the guts to try and get out of my situationship of 5 months after telling me he is moving away multiple times??",/r/dating_advice/comments/o816rg/long_post_pls_read_am_i_f21_being_stupid_wanting/,5

I was 19 at the time and in hindsight, very immature, naive and scared. It also would be useful to point out that I’ve never been in a relationship before and I’m from South America so I don’t have experience with any of this and there could also be some cultural differences that play out. 
Fast forward to two months ago, I find him on a different app and I thought it would be funny to like him. He liked me back and we immediately started talking. We went out twice that same week. He was incredibly sweet and attentive. It felt refreshing in a way to go out on a date post covid with someone I kind of already knew. 
Everything was amazing for the first month and even until a week ago! 
We were seeing each other at least twice a week, depending on our schedules. I should also mention that he just graduated law school so he is prepping for the bar and immediately started a new job so lately it’s been hard to find time to see each other and I can tell that he’s been stressed out. 
When we first met, we both learned that we’re both moving to different cities by the end of August so we kind of had a silent agreement for us to have a summer “fling”. 
Regardless of that, we’ve been to a lot of different dates that don’t necessarily end in sex. We’ve been out to dinner, drinks, he bought us tickets to a baseball game, we’ve been to a museum, on walks, we’ve cooked together, he’s shown me around his neighborhood, we’ve played tennis, etc. 
I thought everything was going great up until this last week. 
He was with his parents who came here two weekends ago so I couldn’t see him then. However, last week we saw each other on 3 separate days. 
He lives a little far from me (30-45mins usually bc there’s almost always traffic) and usually picks me up when we go out (i don’t have a car) so I thought I’d surprise him that day by going to his neighborhood. I could tell that he was acting a little distracted. I thought it was probably because of work and because he had to go to a going away party for one of his close friends later on so he seemed nostalgic. However, he had baked me some bread as an apology because he forgot he had to go there when he scheduled this date with me. We also went out the next day for a drink and he seemed normal. He then told me that he would let me know if he would drive back to his hometown on Saturday and if not, that he would give me a tour of his school. 
He texted me on Friday and we went out and did that on Saturday. I baked him cookies so that the container he gave me wouldn’t be empty when I gave it back to him (and also because I like doing that for people sometimes) That day he seemed once again kinda sad and nostalgic. He told me that 2 of his best friends were moving (one last Sat and another one today) and he was obviously not looking forward to saying goodbye to them. That’s when I understood why maybe he’s been a little weird. Long story short, I thought that date was really nice overall but when he dropped me off he didn’t say anything about his schedule for the week which I thought was really weird because he’s always really open and honest about what he’s doing every week. He also said “I’ll see you” instead of “I’ll text you” (which is what he’d normally say). Anyway, that was last Saturday and he hasn’t texted me at all this week.
I am so sad because I don’t know if I did something to upset him or if he’s just not interested in me anymore. I want to know what should I do???
I haven’t texted him because I figured I didn’t want to crowd him since he already has a lot on his plate but not even receiving a “hi, How are you?” is incredibly painful.
I know he’s not the love of my life and that this is not a movie but he had told me how much fun this summer would be and I just want to fix it and end it on good terms at least. 
I would really like some male perspectives on this please 🙏🏻 because I really struggle to know what goes on in your heads",/r/dating_advice/comments/o8df7z/help_please/,8

Its like I meet them via dating apps, talk for a little, hookup, then Im like wow Hes so awesome and I want to date him- but I barely know him! For instance, I matched with a guy on hinge back in December- we lived in different cities so we texted for the past 8 months. It started off friendly for the first few weeks- then got super sexual (granted I let it get that way) and has been that way ever since. He sends me lots of pics of videos of his d\*ck and asks the same from me- lots of sexting and such. It is probably the most intense sexting ive ever done. Now I live in his city and we met up to hookup only twice over the past two months- and I am like obsessed with him. And i also already know hes not that great! I think If we did spend time together sober, outside of sex, I would see him for what he really is and I wouldnt be so into him anymore. How can I prevent this? Spontaneous hookups are exciting to me, and I live in NYC where almost 96% of the guys dont want to hangout with you to actually talk to you.",/r/dating_advice/comments/o9nfd7/how_to_not_obsess_over_people_you_barely_know/,5
30,o9w7pw,dating_advice,Tue Jun 29 02:35:44 2021,How to keep things casual?(22M),"
Hey there, I’m a single guy in his 20s living in NYC. I’ve decided to write here because this is the second time this has happened to me and I just feel fed up and disappointed. 

I’ve been seeing this girl for 3 months, going on dates probably every other week and having really fun amazing dates, nothing fancy just drinks/going to the park and seeing where the day takes us going  on spontaneous adventures and sharing a lot of laughs. We’ve gotten physical but only as far as making out, after 3 dates I made a move but she said it takes her a while to feel comfortable having sex with someone, I said I completely understand we can take things slow. After more dates we made plans for her to stay the night at my place but they fell through. I know the physical attraction is there between us (she’s told her friends). A few dates later fast forward to this week and she told me she isn’t in a place mental health wise to be dating right now. But she told a  mutual friend she doesn’t want anything serious but would be serious with me if she was in a better place mentally and for now just wants to hookup with random people. 

I’m just frustrated because it’s been 10 months since I’ve had any sex (my last breakup), and as a fit and decent looking guy I would love to be someone’s casual hookup but I always find girls viewing me as the relationship type. While I’m not a fan of one night stands with strangers from a bar I still very much enjoy casual sex. My girl friends say I need to pretend like I don’t care, but that’s just not who I am I’m not the type to leave girls on read for days or give mysterious cryptic responses, I’m a friendly outgoing and confident guy and I don’t want to change that. 

How can I say to this girl and make it clear thatd I’d be perfectly fine with a casual hookup situation like she is?

For the future:

25,ob2kqj,dating_advice,Wed Jun 30 20:50:56 2021,Is my relationship toxic?,"&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if this subreddit will allow it but here I go.

I have been dating this girl, let's call her B. I started dating her back in October 2020 and it's now the end of June 2021. This has been my longest relationship and before we became official, she seemed to be one of the very few women that I dated that wasn't crazy. However, it seems we keep arguing, and I've ignored it because they say healthy relationships argue a lot depending on sources and I thought sooner or later we'd fix our issues, but I feel it's become too much and that this relationship has become toxic.

I'm not going to say I was the best, but I know she's messed up a bunch during our relationship too and I also feel that she's become crazy/less logical because of my past actions.

We still love each other. I've still made the effort to be there for her because she's got a rough family life at home and I just wanted her to see that I love her and that I want to be there for her and make her happy. Sex with her was always the best sex I've ever had. We have made good times and great memories throughout our relationship. Although it seems like they don't matter to her because she said all those good times, great memories, and fun dates were her idea and that I wouldn't have done them with on my apparently absent volition.

*What I Done That Got Her Mad...*

* I flirted with some girls months back, like two months after becoming official.
* Before becoming official, we were openly dating. She decided to only date me, but I wasn't exclusively dating her because I didn't want that at the time.
* Got mad I had sex with girls before we became official.
* I made friends (nothing sexual intent) with a few girls on Bumble Dating.
* I didn't block girls on my social media because she thought I had crushes on them. When in reality it was because those girls were friends, old coworker friends, old classmates/schoolmates, and ok some I had a little crush on (before I even met her).
* I tried meeting in the middle because I thought this was crazy. She got mad that I simply unfollowed them and didn't straight up just block them, because she thought I'd just look them up n shit because they still followed me. Even when I forcefully unfollowed them and unfollowed them from me, she got mad I didn't straight up block them! Even though if I just blocked them, I could find them again in my blocked list. And I don't know about you guys, but I'm barely someone to block people on social media unless you're a spammer, scammer, or someone I really don't like from prior personal experience.
* She got mad that I didn't block and delete the contacts of a few exes. Why did I keep those few? Because even after breaking up, we didn't break up hating each other, they didn't seem crazy to me, and they're fun to hang out with even if without sexual content. Like just as friends.
* I lied that I stopped watching porn.
* She got mad that I had multiple gmails and Instagram accounts.
* She got mad that she found Twitter accounts with similar handles to mine, thinking that they were mine. Even though I really never made those Twitter accounts she accused me of.
* I lied that I was with friends when I was hanging with some exes. (No, nothing sexual went down, we played tennis and went to the skatepark, the instances I hung with them)
* I got physical with her about three times at most.
* She got mad I didn't go bragging around to my friends about how awesome of a girlfriend I had and how bomb our sex was.
* When I was on a trip seeing my brother in New York, she kept getting mad I wasn't texting her fast enough when I was walking everywhere in fucking NYC, one of the places you really don't want to walk and text. Saying that she still texted me all the time, during her trip in the rural NorCal Oregon region....
* In May I disabled my Snapchat and Instagram to not only better myself, but also to show her that I want to focus on her. She was apparently stocking my Snapchat score and got mad when I lied that I wasn't on it. Before my NYC trip, I decided to reinstall snap for like two minutes to check what my coworker sent me and then I deleted the app again, and she saw my snap score go up and she got mad.
* We had a breakup during the relationship, well a good few. And she got mad that I had decided to reinstall Bumble because I thought the relationship ended at that point. I proceeded to redelete my Bumble.
* Got mad that I didn't delete my OkCupid account, even though I deleted the app and never went on it since we became official. Until she went snooping in my Gmail for shit on me and if I deleted everything perceived to be sketchy.
* She got mad that some hookup/dating websites ended up in my junk folder, and she thought that I went on them. What were these websites? BangHookups and SingleAsians! I know I definitely didn't sign up for these. For one, it was in June and I know I hadn't been on any dating sights since the Bumble incident. Two, the website had nude pop-up ads like you'd get on a porn site and all the ""girls"" that somehow matched with me were girls that were all clearly bots! Three, there was no profile picture of me and no bio on there, because I didn't make these accounts, so how could these ""girls"" have wanted to swipe on this account of ""mine"". Literally the next day, I check my junk folder cause I know I'm right and THEN I SAW IT, a new sexual website scam called MatchSniper! And she said basically that it is my fault that I have sexual-related scams and spam in my Gmail and that if I don't delete them then it looks bad on me!
* She got mad that my mom wanted us to use protection/some form of birth control since we fucked in my parent's house, and used plan Bs multiple times, and B blamed me saying that it was only me who wanted to fuck raw. When she clearly did too.

*What She Did That Got Me Mad...*

* She'd keep flip-flopping and saying that ""oh you don't love me, care for me, respect me, watch out for me, take me out on dates"" to ""I'm sorry I do realize you love me, care for me, respect, watch out for me, take me out on dates.""
* Every time I take her out, she says either that it was her idea or that it's because we had an argument earlier and that I was just trying to be nice after an argument. When I drove her to practically every single one of our dates, paid for almost every date, and no I never expected or even wanted sex in return! The sense of acknowledgment and for her to be happy was all I wanted! And yet she keeps thinking I'm doing all this out of guilt, every time.
* She tried claiming that because she reminded me, a week before Valentine's Day, that it was all because of her that we had a Valentine's Day date. Cause that somehow compares to me already have prepared a beach date with her favorite wine and rainbow flowers. It's like ordering a custom cake. but saying you baked it and decorated the cake all by yourself.
* She told me to keep deleting my junk folder and finding out how to stop those sexual-related scam websites I mentioned earlier.
* During our first big breakup, I went to a party with my female best friend, let's call her G. And told her I did wrong to my gf, and that I got physical with my gf. She proceeded to DM my gf and ask her what happened, and she proceeded to tell her that I was manipulative, that I never cared or loved her, and a bunch of other crap.
* She didn't tell me that my female best friend ended our friendship with me until I saw that G was calling her a few weeks after the party I went to. I told her many of times that I was worried what happened with G and she never said anything. When she said she was going to a kickback with some friends, in reality, she was partying with G and trying to set her up with the friends of G's cheating and still current boyfriend.
* She lied and lied that she wasn't flirting with guys at the party and that a flirty guy grabbed her ass at the party, and even tried ending the relationship off on that point. Until days later she finally admitted she was flirting back with the guy too! And yet said she wasn't in the wrong because we were broken up, even though she said I was in the wrong because I had remade a Bumble account when we were broken up!
* She wanted me to block and delete contacts of everyone I had a smidge of attraction towards, even for people I just see as friends or acquaintances today. And yet I asked her to do the same then, going through the guys she had in her contacts and social media (she looked through my socials and contacts too btw) and kept saying that they were just friends and never found them interested. Even though from all the stories she told me about guys and her guy friends, she's told me she had crushes on them, but ""oh that was in the past.""
* During the middle of our relationship, she still had her bumble account and her Instagram handle in the bio. I told her basically that all these guys in her Instagram wanted to fuck her, besides the gay ones, and I was right. Especially since her ""guy friends"" from school were DMing her asking her out and she still kept guys on her socials that sent pics of their dicks. Even though she wouldn't want me to have girls on my social media sending me nudes.

And of course, her family thinks I'm the only one in the wrong and my family thinks I did some wrong but that she's manipulative, controlling, and trapping me.

I also wanted to get the opinion of others if possible. Like, do all girls just block guys for whatever reason under the sun like how my gf wanted me to do with girls? Am I really at fault for not cleaning out all of the sexual-related scams in my junk folder? Am I hypocritical? Is she hypocritical? Is it okay to have friendships with your exes?",/r/dating_advice/comments/ob2kqj/is_my_relationship_toxic/,15
65,obmz66,dating_advice,Thu Jul  1 17:27:50 2021,I’m beginning to feel like the importance of looks has been understated all of my dating life.,"
I’m 21 and I’ve had no success in relationships or dating. This isn’t to make a pity post. This also isn’t to complain about the fairer sex, it’s just something I want to know if other guys have noticed. I feel like since I was a kid, the importance of my appearance in every aspect of life but most importantly for this post, in dating has been severely understated.

I have always been the ugly fat one, like if I was in a boy band I’d be that one token ugly guy that everyone’s like “Why is he there?” I’ve tried to not let it bother me too much but bullying was RELENTLESS. Honestly I didn’t get a break from it until college and I still caught shit for it until 2020 and I started wearing a mask and hiding from people.

Despite this I didn’t worry about dating too much from messages given to me by my family, friends, and America’s favorite babysitter TV. They always told me that the ugly nerd gets the girl because it’s all about personality and that if I work on myself the good will attract girls. Like look at any romcom from the 2010s. It’s all underdogs getting the girl because of their personality. 

I spent high school and early college working on myself. I took academics very seriously and did so well that I got awarded a full ride to my college where I still make the deans list consistently, lost the weight and got into pretty decent shape, I did a lot of extracurriculars and learned how to play the piano, I also volunteered and did community service as much as I could, I even taught myself how to cook when my parents refused to because I’m an guy.

I’ve always been told that I have qualities women love. I’ve been told by friends that I’m funny, intelligent, hardworking, compassionate and fun to be around and I don’t think they were just blowing smoke up my ass. I haven’t had a problem making friends with girls, but I just can’t even get a first date. When I go on dating apps I get no matches.

I think I rightfully feel like my biggest obstacle is the way I look. At this point I’m not sure what else it could be. The most unattractive features are things I can’t change and when I look in the mirror I just feel hopeless. The constant rejection is slowly tearing down my self esteem.

This may be dramatic but I feel like I was kinda tricked into thinking appearance didn’t matter as much as it does. I have good looking friends that do nothing but drink, party, and barely pass their classes and they do incredibly well and get beautiful girls. Maybe I just don’t see it but I don’t get how they do so well.

Does anyone else feel this way?",/r/dating_advice/comments/obmz66/im_beginning_to_feel_like_the_importance_of_looks/,10

We’re based in NYC and have met 5 times, averaging to once a week. On the first date, he had told me that he will try his best not to be in a relationship as he would like to feel what it’s like to date around (he just got out of a 6-year relationship). Overall I really enjoy our chemistry together, so I told him that I’m just dating around until I find someone that I want to get serious with. At this point, I began to think that me and him are not in the same page in terms of what we want in a long run. 

We had sex after our second date. We both agreed that the sex was amazing and that he’s really attracted to me. Nonetheless, he avoided doing the “relationship thing” like holding my hand (we naturally held hand twice, but he would back off and say it’s too relationship-y). I want to respect his boundaries, so a few days later I texted him to ask if he wants to just be FWB, as us going out can be expensive, and I sure should not put myself in the position to catch feelings. His response was that he genuinely like our time together and would rather not only just have sex with me - that he would like to keep dating me. This is when I told him to just enjoy the moment with me. Then we set to meet up again.

The next date, I took him to my favourite bar and ended up drinking in the park. I ended up telling him that I’m currently seeing just him. He suddenly became really giddy and pull me in for a kiss. He admitted that he went on another date last week but didn’t feel the vibe with her as much as he did with me. Also that he told his friends about me. Whilst walking back to my place, he held on to my waist and occasionally kissed me on my head. We had sex again and he wouldn’t stop kissing me all over my body. It did feel really romantic to me the whole time we were together (especially in the park). So I don’t really know how to feel because he did say originally that he doesn’t want anything too serious.

Is this normal?

I am not american (I’m french) and never been there (so if you give me the example of african americans I can’t relate). I’ve had (and still somehow) fight with BDD (body dysmorphic disorder) which made me deal with eating disorders and strongly hatred of my appearance. So recently I realized that the reason I was never satisfied with facial features is because of my racial background. I’ve never experienced racism or even rejection because of my race. I’ve never actively looking for someone. I had some « flings » but that’s it. I feel like black women (the worse it is for the darkest ones with the kinkiest hair) are at the bottom of the pyramid when it comes to attraction. They are portrayed in a negative way in society (angry, too strong, ghetto, vulgar, oversexualized, sex workers). Subconsciously people feel this way about them. Overall their features are perceived as unattractive. Regardless of my personality, I feel like the main reason for me to not be in a relationship it’s because of my race. I’m actually thin/ skinny, it doesn’t benefit me of anything, all I want to do is binge with crappy food (it makes me feel less alone and food can be hormonal pleasure) and become fat so at least I could fit the stereotype of the fat black woman undesirable that no one wants to f****. In what world it would benefit me to exercise (I used to walk a lot, do yoga some pilates,running and hiit) and be vegetarian/ vegan if at the end of the day I will end up alone of because of something I can’t change. In what world it would benefit me to wear makeup if after all I’m unattractive and girls of the same level of attraction (but of a different race) as me will always be prefered. When I see white girls or east asian girls I feel so envious of them, because I know they are the most desirable group of women.

Then COVID hit and it just got stale and the sex diminished. She broke up with me and used mental health as an excuse and that I dont care about her students (Unreal). I never saw it coming. This happened last week of February. I walked away and havent heard from her since. I blocked her on everything. Unfollowed her entire circle who definitely played a part in her making this big decision.Saw her on Hinge a couple weeks after. It hurts.

So since then,
- Got promoted
- Went to therapy
- Moved to my own studio apartment in NYC
- Lost weight and got my muscle back

I also have been seeing someone since March. It was a once or every other week thing but I feel like the coldest person ever. Like, I have no feelings and I can tell shes starting to really like me. It really bothers me. On the other end, I still feel completely lonely. Everyday I worry that I'm about to hit 30. I wanted dogs kids and a family and I have to reset at 29..

I keep trying to tell myself that it will all be good. Something good will happen. But every day I sit there alone and I get sad and it takes so much energy to pick myself back up.

90,ofov1k,dating_advice,Wed Jul  7 21:25:05 2021,How should I approach cultural differences with my girlfriend?,"So I’ve been seeing this girl for a few weeks and we decided to be officially a couple this past weekend. She’s great and treats me well and I’m enjoying being with her. 

She is from Sri Lanka and only immigrated to Canada in September. She comes from a very traditional and religious culture and family. She is a practicing Buddhist.

I am your typical white Canadian guy from a non-traditional family that threw off its Christian values a generation ago.

We discover taboos with each other a lot. Sometimes it can be difficult to navigate and make one or the other uncomfortable briefly, other times it’s absolutely hilarious. 

Overall I am really enjoying the challenges with dating someone from a completely different culture. The issue that is bothering me comes to expectations of women. In her culture the woman of the house serves everyone and doesn’t sit to eat until everyone is happy. 

In our culture, or at least how I was raised. Nobody eats until everyone is sitting, you especially wait for the host to be sitting. This results in neither of us eating while I wait for her to sit and she waits for me to eat. It’s kind of funny sometimes but tbh it makes me super uncomfortable. We are taught that’s sexist in North America, but it makes her really happy to serve others.

The second issue is she is still a virgin. I’ve had countless sexual partners and she seems to be fascinated by this about me. I think it kind of turns her on haha. She wants to start doing anal sex and we do everything but vaginal penetration. She’ll even put my dick halfway into her vagina but not all the way. 

Im totally fine with her wanting to remain a virgin and don’t intend to pressure her. What bothers me is that to her and her culture, virginity is purely about having an intact hymen. That value no longer exists here and to us virginity is something total different. She got really scared when I told her that the hymen can be broken by fingering, yet she’s been fingering herself her whole life. I get the impression she has poor education about pregnancy and some other sex ed topics.

I don’t want to mansplain her body to her. How should I go about discussing my values around gender roles and sex as they relate to progressive, liberal, North American culture without seeming like I’m trying to force my culture on her?",/r/dating_advice/comments/ofov1k/how_should_i_approach_cultural_differences_with/,0

So I'm 26F and I'd say I'm a catch on paper. I have 2 fancy degrees and a well-paying tech job, have wonderful long-lasting friends and hobbies, and have done some modeling. But I've had *horrific* luck in the romance department for my entire adult life (which I'm sure is made worse by the fact that I live in NYC). It's not for lack of options - I have men all over me. But all of my friends are starting to settle down into long-term relationships and I just keep getting my heart broken. I don't have any single men in my social circle (most of my friends are queer women and all of my male friends are my female friends' boyfriends who are only friends with each other), so the men I'm meeting are on dating apps, at bars/clubs, and when I'm out and about. I do have work and hobbies, but work is 100% remote indefinitely and my main hobby is martial arts so I really don't want to get involved in any gym drama by tapping into that dating pool.

I feel like the same thing keeps happening to me over and over, and it's particularly bad with guys from dating apps. A guy comes on *really* strong, says all the right things, obsesses over me and showers me with affection, blah blah blah. We go out for a couple of months, I finally let my guard down and have sex with him, the sex will be super passionate and will seem great and he'll gush over how great I am and act super excited to see me again, and then once we've done it a few times and the novelty is gone he'll disappear from the face of the earth and my heart will be shattered. 

For years I kept blaming myself for not being pretty enough, for not being good enough at sex, for putting out too soon (no matter how long I waited), for not being interesting/good enough. I took a yearlong break from dating to get my act together, but as soon as I re-entered the dating pool it was back to square 1. I got talking with a guy who's a famous professional athlete who has a reputation for being a really nice guy, so I (foolishly) trusted him - he came on so strong for *months*, sent me good morning texts every single day, he was so kind and made so many promises. I eventually caved and had sex with him and he seemed super happy and gushed about how beautiful I was and how he couldn't wait to see me again. And then, *poof* \- 2 days later, after sending me some very lovey-dovey texts initially, he disappeared. 

The majority of these guys will re-appear eventually - sometimes a month later, sometimes 2 years (!!!) later - and if I engage with them again the cycle just repeats itself. But if I reject them when they re-appear they'll put me on a pedestal and become obsessed with me and will never leave me alone. And on the rare occasion that I do meet a guy who's genuinely nice and cares about me I don't trust his intentions and assume he's going to break my heart the whole time, so my anxiety or self-protective avoidance inevitably sabotages it.

I'm in therapy to work on my own insecurities and I think it's gotten better, but I have no idea how to start picking better guys. When I'm flooded with strangers and am dealing with 20 guys at a bar or 10,000+ likes on a dating app I'm only going to notice the guys who are the best at 'playing the game' and getting attention. It's not that I'm intentionally picking assholes, it's that the nicer guys aren't going to be the ones who are getting in front of me and making moves and escalating things. And because there are no single men in my social circles I have no way of asking my friends about these dudes - they're *all* *strangers*.

How the fuck do I break this cycle? I'm so tired of being hurt by manipulators who know exactly how to get a woman emotionally invested so they can get what they want.  Some of these guys are attractive, but plenty of them aren't, so it's not as simple as just going for less good-looking guys. I have no idea how to vet for decent guys when I have to sort through 10,000+ likes on an app! Have any of you figured out which green flags to look for or gotten out of this horrible, nightmarish cycle?",/r/dating_advice/comments/oj65xn/when_having_too_many_options_makes_it_impossible/,5

41,or1c84,dating_advice,Sun Jul 25 03:18:46 2021,Is guy actually going through something or is he not interested?,"Sorry it's long. 

I'm 24F and the guy I matched with is 28M. He reached out to me first and then I proceeded the conversation by asking if he's in the Army because a picture I saw. I'm in the Army as well so we bonded over that. He told me he got out recently. He was quick to say, ""Let's plan a date."" I agree and we decided to meet Friday. Towards the end of the convo, he told me to text him, he gave me his number.  It was late and I was falling asleep so I text him in the morning saying, ""Good morning."" He responded and we had a short conversation about his birthday since he was celebrating it that day. Told me he's not sure what he wants to do... when I replied, he didn't answer for hours. Which is no big deal to me at first. He text me later at 9pm asking what I'm doing. We had a short convo then he texts me at 1AM asking if I'm awake. I woke up randomly at 2AM and said for a little bit. He told me he's feeling kinda alone. Then said, ""I'm bored and horny as fuckk."" I kinda laughed it off and asked if he's drunk. He apologized and said he is kinda tipsy. Then I asked what he's looking for and he said a friendship to develop into more if the vibes go right. 

So this is what's getting to me....  On Thursday he asked if he can call me. We had a short phone call just talking about our day and agreed to meet that the same day as well as Friday.. We agreed to meet in Manhattan but I asked where and he said we'll figure it out later. I was waiting until it was like 10pm and asked if we're still going. It was a vague date plan so I had to confirm. He responded an hour later saying: 

""Sorry I got caught up with some stuff honey."" 

Then he said , ""Are you in the city right now?""

I live 45 minutes without traffic from NYC so I was kind of irritated because first and foremost,  I'm not a fan of driving in there. It was too late for me to take the train because the last one stops around 1AM. So I kindly told him ""No Im not there lol."" And  I said,  ""maybe it's better we just meet Friday as planned. Let me know a time and place so it will be easier.""

I didn't hear from him all of Friday. Please don't get this twisted,  I don't chase men but I was actually looking forward to meeting him. I reached out around afternoon and asked , ""Hey good afternoon, just checking in to see if you're down to meet today still."" Crickets..... so instead of getting in my feelings, I went out myself for a few drinks.... I got tipsy and sent him a risky text message.  I began to not take him serious because let's be real, it's very clear he's trying to hookup.  so around 8pm I said, ""Hey so obviously tonight is a no go, the other night you mentioned how you're bored and lonely so I'm really wanting dick right now."" I know.... I know I was wild but he did the same to me a few nights ago. 

He responded saying EXACT WORDING

""Sorry Mami.🤦‍♂️ My friend was killed so I've been chillin soaking it in all day.... are you gonna be in the city?"" 

So I said, ""I'm so sorry for loss. I don't know.... I don't mind coming into the city and I apologize for the previous text.""

He responded saying, ""It's ok, where you at?"" 

I told him I'm in Yonkers and to call me if he has a chance (I was driving back home from the bar with my friend) 

He said, ""Yeah, hold up real quick"" 

Then nothing after that.... I was expecting a phone call since I believe his friend was killed like he said. He never unmatched me from Tinder either. 

I did feel bad about his situation but I guess I'm wondering.... WTF is going on with this guy. 🙃 And why did he reach out sending me multiple text messages at once bonding about the Army and planning a date so quick all for him to be inconsistent.

I  booked the accommodations and tickets on Friday but today she just texted me that she would be busy Sunday (I figured we could just hang out for a second date a week before the trip). 

She told me that she was going to sleep late, go shop, and get food with a neighbor she had met. I asked if it was dinner, and I told her to be careful about drinking. She didn’t answer that and said she would be careful. 

Obviously we aren’t in a relationship, but I just don’t feel right going on the trip now. Like if she ends up having sex with the neighbor I have no chance since I’m 30 minutes away. I appreciate her honesty, but I don’t know if she is trustworthy. When we met she told me she had a boyfriend, but when we spent all day together she later claimed that boyfriend couldn’t wait for her if she left the country and they weren’t together (she is from Latin America).

78,ord7by,dating_advice,Sun Jul 25 18:05:47 2021,Am I crazy for going off and calling out this dude who has been slowly ghosting me for weeks,"I'm a 26 year old woman who met a guy about a little over a month ago. He was great—sweet, nice, charming, everything. He lived 45 minutes from me but always insisted on picking me up and taking me back to his place because he didn't want me spending all that time taking three different trains. We spent like the whole first week together—I live in NYC and took the train from his place literally straight to work which was like 50 minutes. I even spent the night and whole day with him at my place on his birthday, which he said was one of the greatest he's had in a long time.

The night after we had our most intimate night (like emotionally, sexually, etc), and he drove me to the nearest subway stop the next morning, I had this intuitive feeling that things were gonna start to change. He slowly stopped texting less, I would get one word responses on my Snapchats to him, and we stopped hanging so much (partially because he started working full time). Eventually I got frustrated with him I said ""damn ok if you're just gonna give me one word responses I'm just gonna stop"" and he said ""ok"". That was like 6 days ago. We didn't talk at all at that time.

A couple nights ago, I reached out and asked like what happened and that if he lost interest or whatever I would've rather known. He blew me off just saying ""it aint that deep I just been working"". Yesterday morning he backtracked and sent me a message at 7:30am saying ""please don't think you did anything wrong, I've just been distancing myself from everyone, I still really like you"". We talked yesterday and tried to have a convo about it, although I was annoyed that he was joking that I wrote a whole ""paragraph"" to him about it when I could have just said ""what's up"" or ""I miss you"" which after that previous asshole response I wasn't gonna do. I just wanted to understand why he was slow ghosting me and I'd rather know where he was actually at, which I don't think is wrong. He basically told me he's working all the time and the day or two he has off he's doing things he needs to do or seeing his family. I was like ok so you're too busy to chill with me. I mentioned that I'm leaving on August 3rd to go abroad for two months so idk if I'm gonna see him before that. He asked me if I wanted to see him, and I said yes, and then said we could hang tonight (last night). I said yeah sure, and we even planned 3 hours or so before I was supposed to come over to spent the night about whether he'd drive or I'd take the subway and he seemed serious about it.

Come around 9pm I message him and ask so what time we meeting up, and he suddenly says he's in bed and doesn't feel like driving. I was like ""I could take the train and it would take like 2 hours anyway so it's only 15 minutes for you to drive"" and he's like ""nah I wouldn't make you do that"". So I naturally got mad, like you're cancelling on me after we talked all day right before I'm supposed to come? He started making all these excuses that he had to get up the next day, blah blah, and so I got more annoyed and called him out on making excuses and told him like this is exactly what I was talking about when I said he'd lost interest in me but just wasn't owning up to it. Like who knows if he even actually wanted me to come, he might have just said that. So I sent all these messages about how it's a total dick move to just cancel right before we're supposed to hang out and that he reaffirmed my ""paragraph"" by doing this and he just sent a laugh emoji and said ""you finished?"" And then said I'm weirding him out with my messages when I was just holding him accountable for his actions and that they *were* shitty, but he tried to gaslight me by saying ""I'm scaring him away"" and that I'm the problem because no one's ever been scared away by him. Definitely got a major ego issue there.

I wouldn't have been sooo angry if he hadn't been acting like this for weeks. Like if things were fine between us and he suddenly was like I'm super tired, then I would have understood way better, but this just seemed like a cowardly excuse to basically say he doesn't want to see me anymore. Part of me was so angry and sent those angry texts because I knew this would have been the last time I probably would have gotten to see him before I left, and HE was the one who invited me and then cancelled last minute. Like I mentioned that of course I'd be disappointed when I was looking forward to it, and it seemed we resolved our differences, only for him to do that. I realize he's the kind of guy who just is almost amused by women's anger, like it's some sexist affirmation of women freaking out as always. Like he was gaslighting me about getting angry and making it all into a big joke, instead of listening to anything I was saying he just deflected it.

In the end all he said was ""ok"" and we left it at that. I know it's over, but I'm just shocked at how slowly worse he had gotten and then pulled not only one shitty move with what I said to him 6 days ago and with all that I said to him last night. My sister said honestly getting so mad was probably worse than if I just said ""fuck you"" and kept it short, which I do wish I did now, but it was a lot of pent up anger. He made me feel crazy for it, and now I'm questioning myself about whether I was being crazy about it, because I was *furious*. I hate when people invite me to something only to uninvite me a few hours later after we already make plans, and just making excuses about it, so yeah I got angry, but I also feel like guys do this slow ghost shit all the time and it gets frustrating and exhausting and I was utterly shocked when he did that. Idk I'm not going to message him anymore since I was ""scaring him away"" but he obviously has a fragile ego that can't take every ounce of truth I told him. Some guys just don't care about women's anger and just think it's them being crazy, so it's making my head spin trying to understand ""oh did I overreact.""",/r/dating_advice/comments/ord7by/am_i_crazy_for_going_off_and_calling_out_this/,18

19,osx63q,dating_advice,Wed Jul 28 01:48:25 2021,Feeling confused and unsure if I should apologize or not,"I (26F) finally went on a date with a guy (30M) who I've been curious about for years. He's always lived in LA while I've lived in NYC. We talked / texted a bit about 7 months ago , but stopped talking as we both had our own lives to live (his dad passed away, we both live far away ). However we had both agreed we would like to hang out and get to know one another, if we happened to be in the same city.  I just recently came on a trip to LA, and finally mustered up the course to reach out. Let me just say he is more than gorgeous, and is also very nice. I like his energy and we had good sex. But I also know we are very different, our ways of thinking and going about the world are quite polar opposites, (I am more spiritual and a bit more complicated and he is more scientific and minimalistic) and we are both are going through really a really difficult period of our lives, me especially and the mood was low. 

 My last boyfriend passed away a few months back, and I've been trying my best to move forward.   
I feel a bit guilty because looking back on the date, I realized I didn't bring my best self to the table, and I hope that he didn't take it personally. He made some moves on me and I didn't reciprocate many of them, not because I didnt like him, but because I was feeling so terrible. I still really miss my last boyfriend, and I don't really know if I can ever get closure. He is the first guy I've really seen / slept with since the passing of my last partner, and I found it very hard to just relax and have a good time. We both know our meeting was nothing serious as I will be returning back to NY soon. I'm not sure if he expected things to be different, But I can't help but feel like I made a mistake with the timing of things. 

I've been thinking about texting him all day to say that I'm sorry for not being in the best place / waiting until the right time. In a way I feel like I disrespected myself , and him because I did initiate the plans, and I didn't know my own boundaries and rushed things, wanting to make the most of my trip to LA  and see him as I'm unsure when I will return. I feel terrible because I do really care about him, I know he is lonely and struggles to put himself out there. I could tell this experience might have meant something different to him than it did to me. I think I wanted it to mean more to me, and I wish I had waited till another time in my life to see him. Because I do genuinely care about him, and I wouldn't mind spending more time with him in the future if we happen be in the same city (hooking up, casually hanging out, etc) if the time is right. I know right now we aren't that great for each other. But I wanted to make things right.   
I sent him a follow up text thanking him for coming, that I had a good time, and I hoped some day we could hang out again soon. He replied saying pretty much the same message, but I still cant help but feel bad. I don't know if there is any point in apologizing for misjudging my boundaries and carrying him into this, but I do care about how my actions impact the feelings of others. Should I apologize? Or am I just being overly emotional given the circumstances, and would that be yet another dis service to myself?",/r/dating_advice/comments/osx63q/feeling_confused_and_unsure_if_i_should_apologize/,2
66,otkbp7,dating_advice,Thu Jul 29 01:12:17 2021,Honest Dating Advice for Men Part 6 (Being Attractive),"Hello again! I've done quite a few articles on how to get out there and start dating, either again or for the first time and I've gotten some positive feedback so today I am going to cover something that I am sure will get some downvotes but I don't mind. Hopefully it helps out the community.

I'm talking about how to be attractive.

I'm going to skip the psychological stuff but obviously being confident, being yourself, being open and honest and (mostly) direct with people is half the battle. Maybe more than half depending on the person. You should always strive to be genuine.

With that covered what if you are doing and being all those things but you are not succeeding in your dating area or maybe you actually are just looking for some pretty superficial encounters, that is totally fine. I don't know why people act like that is a bad thing. Its not like you are tricking or manipulating anyone, if you both swipe right and you both know what's up then have fun.

With all that being said I can state for a fact that several old ladies at the supermarket have called me handsome so here are my secrets.

1. Get comfortable being naked. If the only time you are ever naked is the shower and having sex then just getting naked is going to cause you some anxiety or make you self-conscious. If you live alone just get in the habit of walking around naked, walk in front of mirror, see yourself when you're not posing. Being naked shouldn't be weird to you, get used to what you look like. Its a strange little trick but you will be surprised.
2. Humans are animals and animals look for other animals that are healthy. You want to look healthy and be healthy. Key indicators of health are energy level, hair, skin, teeth, and nails. These are the parts of our body we show the world.
3. Energy level. You want to project a level of vitality, good sleep, a good diet, and a positive outlook will all help with this and people will notice.
4. Hair. I'm not going to tell you what you should do with your hair when it comes to style but whatever it is it should have a healthy texture (if you are dying it a lot then this is really unlikely to be the case because dying you hair damages it. It does. I mean it just does damage it.) If you are going grey (mine sure is) then just let go grey. You would be surprised how much a lot of people like that. I get compliments on my hair all the time and have even been accused a few times of dying it that way on purpose. Don't shy away from your greys. If you are a man and you are starting to go bald there has been a lot of advancement in the science behind fighting hair loss. Do some research, you will be amazed. If you're a man and you are going hardcore bald then you should absolutely shave your head. Hanging on after the battle is lost looks terrible to everyone around you. Shaving your head is way better. If you have ever asked yourself ""can people tell I'm going bald?"" then they can tell. If you are a woman and your are starting to go bald then there is a lot of science behind fighting that as well, I won't tell you what is beautiful but if it is bothering you don't ignore it. There are a lot of options out there.
5. Skin. Skin is a combination of what goes in it and what goes on it. Try to eat a clean diet (I will go into healthy eating in another article), drink plenty of water, and keep products that come in contact with your skin to a minimum. I realized when I counted my shampoo, my conditioner, my two hair products, my toothpaste, that was 5 products right off the bat. Try not to wear makeup products all the time, let you skin breath and reset as often as possible. If you have severe acne then you can consult with your doctor about some treatment options, this isn't something that you should just have to deal with forever. Stress affects your skin a lot but there is a good chance you are already doing what you can about that, stress can be hard to avoid. If you are having skin issues you should be consulting a DERMATOLOGIST, not an online quiz or the label in the store. Getting good sleep is going to help you a lot.
6. Teeth. You absolutely don't need to have perfect teeth and they don't need to be that pure porcelain white. What you do want is to look like you are healthy and have had good healthcare and you take care of yourself. If your teeth are just super jacked then I would consider braces or a braces alternative (there are many). It is an investment that will be with you for the rest of your life, it can even aid in your quality of life by making it easier to enjoy foods. If your teeth are only a little crooked I wouldn't worry about that at all, it adds a little character and makes you more relatable and approachable if anything. When it comes to whiteness just look in the mirror and ask yourself if your teeth look like teeth. If they do you are probably good, if you smoke, drink a lot of red wine, coffee, or they are stained from something else then pickup those whitening strips they sell at the supermarket and plop those on for like a month. Its a small effort, small cost investment. It'll be a nice little self-esteem boost, don't overthink it. I whitened my teeth after I quit smoking and it was very empowering, it felt like I was taking my body back.
7. Nails. If you are a man you want to have your nails neatly trimmed at all times. I've heard girls say that they hated seeing any white on a man's nails. Seems a little harsh to me but I keep my nails taken care of and that works for me. You don't need a manicure, just trim your nails when they are getting long. If you bite your nails (I had a terrible time with that for a long time) then you want to break that habit. Its not good for you and some people might even consider this a sign of some underlying mental issues. I wouldn't go anywhere near that far but understand some people are going to read into that. If you have anything going on with your nails, like ridges or spots understand those are symptoms and should be discussed with your doctor. It can be a lot of things from malnutrition to much more serious conditions. I am absolutely not a doctor and I am not giving medical advice, if you see something going on with your nails you should bring it to the attention of your doctor. If you are a woman you should do your nails however you want. I don't know if those pointy artificial nails are becoming a thing now or not, maybe they are.

Moving on past the basics.

1. Exercise. You want to have exercise somewhere in your weekly routine. Its not always about weight loss, exercise makes you much healthier and that is going to bleed through in a lot of places. 3 times a week for about an 1 hour each time should really have you covered. What if you want to get really ripped? You can do it, I totally did but understand that it takes an enormous amount of time and effort. If you want to look like a action star then remember those guys got paid to just workout non-stop for 6 months, sometimes even with steroids and they weren't in bad shape to begin with. When I was super ripped I worked out everyday, some days it was only a few hours, some it was 4-6 hours, and some days I would just get up and start working out and workout the entire day. Your diet has to be pretty much perfect too and that's a whole other article.
2. Clothing. The most important part of what you wear is ensuring that it fits you properly. Don't buy clothes with the idea that you will fit into them later, if your body changes shape then you can look forward to tossing those clothes out then. It will be nice and cathartic. 
3. After fit you should strongly consider having something in your outfit that pops, like a bold tie if you are being formal, or a nice watch, or even some brightly colored shoes. This gives the eye something to look at, the trick is to keep your other items matte. If you have 3 or 4 eye-catching pieces you might be fun to look at or even give people a smile or a chuckle but you probably won't be taken seriously. Your clothes should look new and fresh, no stains or holes. I live in America and I can tell you that depending on where you live you can get articles of clothing for a few dollars so having really rundown looking clothes is a red flag for most people. Feel free to swoop through thrift stores if you are skinny on the dollars, I've found some great stuff. 
4. Your clothes should be appropriate to the season, you don't need to be wearing a leather coat in the middle of the summer in the south. Don't wear cargo shorts or cargo pants. Baseball caps are cool to wear but that is pretty much the only type of hat you can wear that isn't based around keeping your head warm. There are tons of cool sunglasses, don't know what to pick? Aviators are always a good choice. Big is good, small is problematic. You don't want to look like Morpheus from the Matrix.
5. Regardless of your level or ripped to unrippedness your clothes need to fit. This is really important.
6. If you can't grow a beard please give up. You'll know a few weeks after trying, all those beard oils and balms are made-up, they don't do anything, your beard is not a forest. If you can grow a beard rock on, I would recommend keeping it relatively short but women like all kinds of beards. There was a time when there were a lot of different combinations of facial hair that were in style but we are pretty much down to just full beards at this stage in the game.

In summary regardless of your genes, if you exercise regularly, you have healthy looking teeth that are reasonably white, a bit of a tan, clear skin, healthy hair, and clothes that make sense for your environment and that fit you then you can't go wrong. You have maxed your physical attractiveness. 

Remember at the end of the day this is about feeling good about yourself and feeling good about who you are. Your appearance doesn't need to have anything to do with that but we are all human and if it does and if you decide you want to work on something and people shit on you about it then you should probably not hangout with those people. This should be about you.

12,ou7yln,dating_advice,Fri Jul 30 01:32:12 2021,"I dont understand why someone would want a ""submissive"" woman who ""does whatever you want""? 24M","Ive been made fun of for this. Called names and such for saying it just seems weird and wrong lol. 

""American women think too highly of themselves, you have to treat them badly to let them know you are better than them"" 

Honestly, what is the point in this, if women WANT me to be mean to them, then... ig im gonna never get laid. I just dont get why youd want this, ive even had people suggest to go overseas to find ""more submissive"" women who exist to ""please"" lol wtf does that even meannnn?! 

Also they tell me, you cant take advice from women, because... they will lie to make themselves seem morally good. When they really only care about looks and money. But, if women are people... why cant they tell you what they like themselves? 

Why would you want some submissive woman who does whatever you want? If that is the case, shouldnt you just marry a virtual assistant or something? I just dont understand. Human beings I think have their own opinions and feelings, which is what makes a relationship meaningful. 

Also, I get shamed for like, ok like ive never had sex, so forgive me if I dont know what im talking about; but I get shamed for wanting to do sexual things with women such as doing the oral stuff... like idk, sometimes I just wonder what its like to make a woman feel good sexually by doing that... idk if it actually works or whatever ive just seen it done and I thought maybe girls would like it. I just wonder what its like to make a woman feel good. 

Fuck, wow that was weird to say. 

Anyway, ive been told this makes women see me as beneath them... for some reason. Even complimenting them, it makes you a ""simp"" or you will get ""friend zoned"" as if being friends with women needs a term for it because its shameful. 

Why cant people take what women say at face value, I will tell you personally what I feel about sex, dating, and relationships. I assume if women are also human beings, they can also tell you about it as well. I dont think every motivation from women is to manipulate. It cant be possible. 

Also, that one word where women only date up because its their nature... personally idk. Ive been told I need to make more money by guys I used to talk to, if im ever going to be ""allowed"" to be with a woman, because im so ugly or whatever. 

So ive heard womens private area develops moisture from being aroused, im unsure exactly how that works, but I have been told im so ugly that it would be impossible for the moisture to develop. Therefore I need money. But then isnt sex just pointless if im that ugly? couldnt I have a relationship where there is no sex instead? Is sex a requirement for dating? 

Do people actually have to be physically attracted to you for you to date? 

im so frustrated... ugh",/r/dating_advice/comments/ou7yln/i_dont_understand_why_someone_would_want_a/,19
28,oud2js,dating_advice,Fri Jul 30 06:46:53 2021,Honest Dating Advice for Men Part 7 (Common Missteps),"Hello everyone! Well I made it a whole week and of posting an article a day, it feels really good to get back into writing and I really appreciate anyone who takes the time to read it. If this is the first of my posts you have read then for context I am a millennial and I'm not married, I'm an American living in the American South (although I've kind of lived everywhere.) Today I thought I would do a complication post of smaller things that I didn't think were necessarily large enough for their own posts. I say dating advice for men but I think most of this probably applies to anyone.

1. Ghosting. If you are getting ghosted after a few dates that isn't getting ghosted. That is just someone deciding it isn't worth pursuing. I think it is odd that some people seem to expect someone to take them out to diner and break up with them after a few dates. Move on brother. Getting ghosted means you come home and your apartment is half-empty. If this is happening to you a lot then chances are at some point the other person has decided to flee and sees you as unstable or dangerous. This may not even be accurate, you might be being misread but understand that person made a judgement call. I've known women who ghosted guys and it was almost always a safety issue.
2. Overcoming ""Nice Guy"" syndrome. If you find yourself always being the nice guy that gets left out or overlooked remember it has nothing to do with how nice or mean of a person you are. Being a little more of a jerk or negging or being a dick is literally the last thing that will help you. But fear not, this is very fixable. What I've seen tends to be happening is you are not being direct enough. I can almost guarantee it. Try and cultivate an attitude of being open and forward with people. Being direct doesn't mean forceful. It means you communicate your feelings with other people in a way that can be easily understood. Start doing that and your whole world is going to open up, it works with everyone. You will be amazed at how quickly your life will start to get better, just ask to be upgraded, tell the hostess you would like a table near the window, when someone asks what you want for your birthday or where you want to eat tell them truthfully. Its probably the single greatest moment of personal growth I've ever had. Again being direct doesn't mean forcing your personality on people, it doesn't mean being blunt or telling hard truths and it definitely doesn't mean its ok to bully people. Being direct means saying what you mean and telling people what you want to have happen.
3. I promise you are not too ugly. I have never seen the attractiveness of people who were single compared to people who were in couples have any correlation at all. Regardless of what your relationship goals are if you think only the hottest people are hooking up or getting married or having kids then just look around next time you are out. You are not too ugly, whatever your appearance is be happy and understand there is a reason why every porn site has about a billion different tabs. There is someone out there that thinks you are hot as hell. I promise.
4. You may be in a dating desert. I've been in environments where there really wasn't anyone worth going out with. If you are in a major city this is not the case but depending on where you are you could be really limited on options and that's ok, don't beat yourself up. I wouldn't recommend living there forever though.
5. You may actually be the problem. Its harsh but no one ever seems to consider it might be them and if you think about it since 1 person of the 2 is the problem almost every time and some times its both people then you really have a better than 50% chance of actually being at the root of the issue. If you find that people ghost you or stop texting back or disappear from your life as soon as they start getting to know you then you should really consider that you have something to do with what is happening. There is kind of a culture of toxic encouragement, understand that it doesn't benefit anyone to make enemies so just because your friends or people on the internet are telling you its all the other person's fault that might not be true. 
6. If you are really struggling then you should consider getting counseling. Its not like getting chemo, its not going to hurt you or be crazy expensive. If its not your fault then that's fine, a bad relationship or string of relationships can really mess with you, it doesn't have to be your fault to hurt you. I'll put myself out there and say I've gotten therapy multiple times in my life. I've gotten counseling when everything was going great, it helps cement in the good habits you have developed and understand what you are doing right as well. Its not all about trauma. If an athlete can see a therapist about a bad loss in a sport than you are more than justified in talking to someone about someone breaking your heart or abusing you emotionally.

I think I covered most of the topics people have asked about in the comments on my previous posts. Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope some of you found this helpful. If you have something you want me to cover than you can always message me or leave a comment. I'll link my other posts.

32,oue3b8,dating_advice,Fri Jul 30 07:56:22 2021,I’m so confused and I don’t know what to do. How can I have casual sex without being scared?,"Hear me out. I (26f) a few years back about 1 month before I turnt 22 I started dating my childhood friend of nearly 15 years at that time. 

I’m not going into great great details about the relationship. But I was his side chick. I knew I was his side chick. I knew he had a GF. But sadly I was just blinded by the love and comfort he gave me. I always had a crush on him since we were kids.

 The secret relationship lasted 3 years. It was not healthy. Sadly like being blinded, I thought one day he would leave his gf for me. During the third year, that’s when the relationship took the biggest turn. He became more controlling of me. He wanted me to become someone that I didn’t want to become. He became manipulative saying things to me to stay with him. Like I said I am not going into too much detail because the list would go on and on. 

I knew at this point he was trying to make me become like his gf even though he kept telling me how much he hated her and couldn’t stand her. So finally I had the courage to end it right before lockdown. I also no longer talk to him as I don’t want him part of my life anymore.

For over a year I took time to myself and worked on myself. After long thinking and talking to my friends, they told I should finally step out of my comfort zone and trying dating or have casual sex. Regardless if it’s a FWB or a simple ONS. I still have my needs of course so I was down for that. 

Here’s where it gets hard for me. The asshole was my first. So I’ve never been with anyone before or after him. But I can tell that the sex we had wasn’t that good. I know I can have someone pleasure me more better then him.

A friend of mines suggest to go out of town for one night to have a ONS, as she’s been wanting one too. I told her yes because I honestly don’t want a ONS here where I live simply cuz I just don’t want to run into them on the streets or have them stalk me.

I know it sounds crazy. Honestly I blame my mom from watching all the ID channel shows. Now I can’t help but wonder if me doing a FWB or ONS will lead me to having a stalker, obsession, or simply kidnap and murder the same night. 

I don’t have the right guy friends to do these type of things with simply cuz we never see each other like that.

I’m on tinder hoping for a new partner in life or a causal hook up. Somehow when I find someone who also wants a casual hook up, I can’t bring myself to swipe right. 

Also one last thing but I feel like another reason I can’t bring myself to do it is cuz I am simply attracted more towards Korean and Japanese men. Not being racist here. I am Mexican American. The guy I “dated” was Mexican. I’m open to dating any race, but I simply been attracted to Korean and Japanese men since I was like 12. 

Look I know people will judge me from my post. I know what I did was bad and horrible. But I’m 26 now and I just want to live my life just a bit. So if you have anything negative to say then just don’t say it. I made a similar post about this situation not to long ago and got hated on a lot. I’m simply just asking for an advise.

All I want is a casual hookup that could lead to something or nothing at all without feeling scared and insecure. any advise??",/r/dating_advice/comments/oue3b8/im_so_confused_and_i_dont_know_what_to_do_how_can/,9
52,ow0552,dating_advice,Sun Aug  1 23:54:20 2021,How do I [M 40] get a girlfriend?,"I figured I’d just get right to the point lol. I’m 40 years old and I’ve never had a girlfriend or been on a date. I’m not a virgin, I’ve paid for sex in past with a couple of different women, but after finding it unfulfilling I’ve decided to finally try dating. 

I know it’s weird to most Americans but my parents come from a country where arranged marriages are common. I was raised with the expectation that I would have one as well. It wasn’t until I was in my twenties that I decided I wasn’t going to do that. 

Unfortunately I struggled with dating when I was younger. I was shy, obese and had trouble making friends. I was bullied too, I’ve definitely had the experience of guys asking women if they like me only to have then adamantly deny it. I’ve also had guys ask me if I had a girlfriend sarcastically as if it was such a remote possibility.

So here I am, 40 years old and ready to finally put myself out there. Where do I even get started?",/r/dating_advice/comments/ow0552/how_do_i_m_40_get_a_girlfriend/,17
89,owbo25,dating_advice,Mon Aug  2 13:19:39 2021,I actually can’t get over being ghosted. I don’t know what to do anymore.,"Hi, I’m (23F) really struggling to exist and grateful for any advice anyone could offer.



Bit of backstory,  I saw a guy (28M) I really liked in summer 2019. We ended up seeing each other for probably around 4 months. Quite soon after meeting we were spending 2-3 days a week together and I just connected with him like I never have anyone, the chats, the sex, everything. The problem at the time was he was meant to be moving to Australia at the end of the year. When I asked him to lock things down with me, this was his reasoning not to. After this, I disappeared after explaining to him I can’t carry it on as I like him too much.



Fast forward a few months, and he has not moved country. Apparently plans fell through, he even gets into a relationship with some other girl. Needless to say I’m confused as fuck. He reaches out to me in 2020 with an olive branch which I ignore.



Fast forward to now, 2021. He added me on Facebook a few weeks ago, and I thought hey, it’s been long enough, he was out of the relationship for a few months, sounds like maybe he would be looking for something serious now he’s staying in the country. I thought I will give it a shot, I’ve always held a torch and I guess couldn’t help but think it’s meant to be, and it’s finally going to be. After a week or two of regular flirting we finally met up again. It was like nothing had changed, I immediately felt that connection and those feelings again. We both professed how much we missed and thought of eachother over the past couple years. We had sex again, he stayed the night and then texted me the next day saying he had fun,and implied future plans. 



This makes it all the more confusing that after this follow up message, I heard nothing. I of course replied, waited a week, tried another simple message asking how he is, and was ignored. It’s now been nearly a month of silence and I just don’t seem to be healing. I dream of him replying and wake up and bawl my eyes out most days. I’m so sick of it. I’ve had to take time off work which I haven’t in a year. I feel so weak and broken, so angry that I could allow someone to affect me like this, let alone someone who clearly couldn’t care less about my feelings. 




More context, I grew up in a less than desirable environment, fell into the hands of a predator from 13-19 whom eventually ghosted me 3 days after my mother died. Any dating I have done after I seem to be worthless to them too. I don’t know how much longer I can go on like this. I resigned myself to no dating after I stopped seeing this guy in 2019, I tried dating several people but it just made me miss him more. So him coming back and fucking me over like this has just almost paralysed my life. I have a therapist whom I speak to over the phone weekly but I just don’t seem to be getting less tearful and depressed, I haven’t felt so down in years.



If you made it this far, thank you. If you had any advice to offer I’d really appreciate it",/r/dating_advice/comments/owbo25/i_actually_cant_get_over_being_ghosted_i_dont/,34
19,oz0fol,dating_advice,Fri Aug  6 08:35:00 2021,Dating advice for married man,"In a brief, I'm 32m, Australia and have been in monogamous relationship for 10 years. After lots of thinking, I've given up on our relationship. We're together because of kids. Otherwise we don't have anything common.

At this moment I'm looking for companionship/friendship rather than sex. Being social awkward and introvert, I don't have any game or never approached a girl. I'm preparing myself for this.

How feasible for me to approach girls? If I go on dating apps, how should I prepare my profile🤔

5,ozzqjw,dating_advice,Sat Aug  7 22:32:09 2021,Am I playing a victim or am I validly upset?," I was dating this man for eight months, but only saw him ten times. In those eight months, I cut off the relationship twice, when I went six weeks without seeing him, and not from lack of trying. We live in NYC, and only \~ 3 miles apart.

We are both 36 - I have a great job - he is an attending doctor. I was part of NYC's social elite, before COVID. He is really socially awkward and was bullied for years in post grammar school, and has been having a hard time since COVID, since he is from Europe, is really close to his family, and hasn't seen them since the pandemic. I have been writing off a lot of his behavior, because he is so awkward - like ghosting me for a week, because he did not like a joke...

Two Sundays ago, we were out in my neighborhood around sunset, and decided to go to my rooftop. We stopped at my apartment to grab a bottle of wine, then head up (this was his first time at my apartment, even though I invited him three times - he did not want to come over, because he did not want to put that kind of pressure on me). Well, he was excited to see my apartment, so he walked around, then grabbed the glass of wine I poured, and sat on the couch - we never made it to the lounge. We talked for about three hours, when he told me I never make the first move, and he also wants to feel desired. I decide to kiss him.

He gets very passionate and our kissing gets heavy. I ask him if he wants to go to my room - he says yes. I close the shades on three floor to ceiling windows (giving him every opportunity to say let's stop) - then we start kissing. He goes down on me, with my dress still on. Then we start taking off each other's clothes - I ask him if I can go down on him - he says ""no - because then I am going to want to put it in you."" I say ""why are we naked? why don't you want to have sex with me?"" He says he wasn't expecting this and didn't bring any protection - I say I have protection. He then starts frantically putting on his clothes saying we shouldn't be doing this, etc. I try to calm his down, and ask him to sit next to me and he says he usually doesn't use condoms with partners, because they have all been on birth control. I say I am on birth control. He says everyone he has been with, he has been in a long term relationships with all of them. I say well, I don't feel comfortable having sex with someone without a condom I do not see consistently. He starts getting frantic again, and says he needs to go. I ask him to answer my questions. What needs to change in our relationship for him to feel comfortable having sex with me, he says he doesn't know what that is, he will need to think about it. I ask him what does he need from me to see himself dating me more consistently - he says he doesn't know he's never thought about it. I ask him if he wants to continue dating me - he says yes. I told him I did not want him to leave under these terms and said I will make a snack.

He starts frantically putting on his shoes and knocking things over - I told him I will walk him to the elevator, he told me not to, since I was in my pajamas - I was in shorts and a t-shirt. When he was leaving I asked him to text me when he got home. He asked why would I want him to do that? I told him that's fine, don't text me.

He text me that night when he got home. The next day, he was his sunny self, I was hosting book club that night and he was sending me relevant videos. I told him I needed to see him at the end of this week, because I needed to talk to him - he tells me he is busy with work. He was sending me silly memes all week, but when Sunday came around and he made no attempt to meet me, after I offered to go to his very hard to get to neighborhood, I called him out. I told him I really wanted a conversation and was disappointed he could not carve out 30 minutes.

He told me he was sorry, but he was busy with work, and our conversations always run long, but he's ""happy to"" speak to me tomorrow - he can call me after work. At this time - I am exhausted and pissed - you're ""happy to"" do someone a favor like water their plants, show a friend around, not talk to someone you went down on, then when she was extremely naked and vulnerable told her you don't if you will ever want to have sex with her and you don't know if you can seriously date her. I decide not to respond and 11pm the next day, he text me ""I guess that's a no"" - I don't respond.

By Tuesday afternoon, I decide I do not want to be a ghost, so I text him, ""It's okay. You don't have to do me any favors, by talking to me when I am upset.""

The whole week, I literally could not sleep - I went for a 10 mile run at 4am through Brooklyn and Queens. I was conflicted, because I did not want to invalidate his feelings and pressure him into feeling sorry for his valid feelings, but I am important too, and deserved some kind of explanation. By Friday night, I can't take it anymore and tell him I was irate that he was acting like he is doing me a favor, by offering to call me, when he went down on me, then ""waited until I was naked to tell me"" he wasn't sure he would ever want to have sex with me, or date me seriously. I was hurt and confused and he trivialized my feelings.

He said he was sorry for the way I interpreted things, he never said anything about him not wanting to date me or have sex with me, and that I am painting him like an emotional predator in saying he waited until I was naked - he is a good, honest person and I am inferring he is troubled, I am ""frequently disappointed with him and whatever way he is as a person - the writing is on the wall here.""

I told him my only and consistent complaint was that he was so inaccessible and I wouldn't see him for long stretches. Had he made time for me, I wouldn't have interpreted his behavior that way.

I just feel like an idiot. For not knowing how to handle this situation better, for needing closure and making things worst. For my ""pick me"" behavior.",/r/dating_advice/comments/ozzqjw/am_i_playing_a_victim_or_am_i_validly_upset/,9
25,p06hh5,dating_advice,Sun Aug  8 05:29:37 2021,I’ve noticed men never want anything serious with me. How do I fix this?,"I started dating a round a year ago. I can say I winded up in a very short lived relationship. Though they were never very serious with me as they ended things when we had to go long distance. Otherwise, every man I have gone out with did not want anything long term. Even if they stated they wanted a relationship previously. I always found it weird because I never met these people on hook up apps or anything. What’s even weirder is that at times these people would admit to liking me , (and I often felt the same), but would immediately say they wanted something casual. It’s really been crushing my spirit.

I really have been feeling that men are only looking to have casual sex with me or just to hangout indefinitely . Sometimes I think my race might be the issue. I’m a black woman in American primarily dating outside of my race. I always feel like an outsider with men I date. They never introduce me to their friends or family regardless of how long we date. The only exception is when I met my ex’s family, but he introduced me as a friend.

I just want to know what the issue is or what I can do. I don’t dress super provocatively . I never have casual sex. I don’t really even talk about sex to potential partners unless they ask something first. I’m just at a complete loss.",/r/dating_advice/comments/p06hh5/ive_noticed_men_never_want_anything_serious_with/,27
6,p140yp,dating_advice,Mon Aug  9 18:44:18 2021,Would you end the relationship?,"I have been dating a woman for the past 2 months. She’s a single mother with a 5 year old and I’m single father with a 2 year old. I am contemplating ending the relationship because of the limited availability we have to see each other and the prospect of being around her son who I’m not too fond of. 

To elaborate, she has her son every week and on every other weekend, the dad takes their son. So there are entire weeks where she has her son the entire time. She also lives with her mother and siblings. I on the other hand, have my daughter every weekend. I live on my own. 

I live in Elizabeth, NJ and she lives in Brooklyn, NYC and due to the tolls and traffic, we recently agreed that it’s best she takes the PATH train into Newark, NJ so I can pick her up from there. She doesn’t drive. Her commute via MTA into the PATH train is about 1.5 hours. Tolls would cost $20 one way for me to drive to her from where I am. Driving commute to her in time is about on average 1 hour with 25 mins spent in traffic. If there is no traffic, the time to commute via driving is about 35 minutes. We also agreed if I have to drive her back home, we’d split the $20 toll bill. So me driving her home or picking up from her home is a last resort. 

She’s been very considerate and agreeable so far. The sex is great and consistent. There aren’t any big red flags in her personality. However, the entire week she is unable to plan for dates due to having her son. These are the times in which I am free after work at 6pm. She’s only available on every other Friday evening, every other Saturday evening/overnight and most Sunday afternoons. However, this is when I have my daughter who demands attention and of course I want to bond with my daughter and give her that attention she needs. This limits anything my girlfriend and I can do. Everywhere we go has to be kid friendly and I can’t really bond with my girlfriend when I am trying to bond with my daughter during my parenting time. I’ve asked my child’s mother if I can get my daughter on Saturday mornings occasionally as opposed to the normal Friday evening just so I can get a 1 on 1 date with my girlfriend but can’t make that a habit because it is inconveniencing my child’s mother and she can take it to the court and have them adjust my child support and visitation accordingly. 

Then on weekends when she does have her son, it’s really limited what we can do. When we are in the house together, it’s literally cartoons is all we can watch. Forget about anything sexual until they fall asleep. Both kids need our attention and want to play. So forget about bonding with my girlfriend. Her son also is a little disrespectful and usually doesn’t listen due to his mom trying to reason with him like they’re friends. I just have to sit on the sidelines and not discipline him because I wouldn’t want the mother of my child’s boyfriend to discipline my daughter. I would expect the actual parents to take care of that. 

Now even if she was available during the week to date, the commute time would render our get together nearly pointless since she’d take 1.5 hours to get to me and then get home which is 3 hours gone from the time we’d have on weeknights. We could meet halfway and find a place mutually for our date but sometimes I want to just be in a home to relax. Because she lives with her mom and younger siblings, in order for us to get privacy, she’d have to come to my place. 

So in summary, I can only see her once a week and that’s when we have our kids which limits what we can do. And her son seems like a kid I’m not going to like in the long term. Would you end the relationship?",/r/dating_advice/comments/p140yp/would_you_end_the_relationship/,6
70,p1vedp,dating_advice,Tue Aug 10 21:38:27 2021,Crushing hard &amp; sending a 'care package' - long distance dating advice plz,"I kept in touch every couple years (via FB) with friend that I was pretty close to when I was 18 - 20, when I look back I thought it was longer than that for the depth of our friendship... We didn't stay close with regular contact after age 20 due to his gf. Now we're both 35 and happened to become single within 2 months of each other. He started to call me on the reg and I was so oblivious at first, I thought he was just bored and wanting to reconnect with a friend, until our regular flirty chat hit an extreme, now I'm confused af where we're at, and we can't meet in person till his state is out of lockdown (so we're having a wknd of sex as soon as he can get here, and he's being sweet as and admitted he took the opportunity to, umm, crack on (do other countries use that term or just oz?) as it was the first time we were both single, but I guess I'm in shock and confused after all this time. We're face timing a lot, and sending private vids). Now, with that background info can anyone tell me what to put in this package - he's using some crappy throw away masks.. and reusing them, and I said 'I have some decent ones I'll send you' (his location is a current 'hot spot' in Australia) I know he could just buy his own, but I'm crushing so hard and just said I would send him some. Is it cute or despo to make it a lil care package? Like masks, sanny, hand wash (I already have all that stuff) n these lollies I told him kept selling out here (random but really popular where I'm at) and what else? I know I'm overthinking it...

So here's the back story, there's this guy who lived in my apartment complex who would always try to flirt with me whenever he saw me but at the time I couldn't bring myself to speak to him because I'm such a painfully shy person. He's extremely handsome......, like so handsome to the point that when I look at him I get discombobulated🥴 and forget how to speak. Like literally my throat closes and I start to laugh nervously. I went to an all girls high school and never really learned how to flirt/talk to guys not to mention the fact that I'm a socially awkward nerd who watches anime and kdrama/ cosplay for fun. This guy is a basketball player and I do engineering we are such worlds apart, I had such low self esteem back then that I convinced myself that there was no way a guy this popular would ever like me, we have nothing in common plus to make matters worse, I had just migrated to America so my English wasnt that good . I was afraid of making an ass of myself so I avoided him.🤦 I'm an idiot.🤧

At the time I had got with another guy who I had felt more comfortable with. He abused me emotionally for 2years and later got physically abusive as well as cheated on me 😓. I stayed back then because I thought I couldn't do better, I grew in a dysfunctional household and didn't realize how much I internalized the abuse which caused my low self-esteem as an adult. I ended the relationship with my ex and went to counseling for a year and I'm not as depressed as I used to be. 

The basketball player guy who use to call to me never had long conversations with me just a hey how's it going and a few flirtatious glances. I never really engaged in long convo out of fear of saying something stupid and embarrassing myself...oh did I mention I was a virgin back then.... Lmao so I was even more scared to talk to him😭. Anyways it's been 2 years since I last saw him he had moved out of the apartment complex when I was visiting my family and I didn't ever get to tell him how I felt. So for the last couple days I've been doing some digging and found his Twitter and IG (yes I know this sounds very stalkerish but I promise I'm not a weirdo😭) I was so shy I didn't even get to ask him what his name was and I never introduced myself. I looked at his profile and apparently he had a rough breakup with his ex around the same time I ended my relationship. Turns out he's not from America either and English isn't his first language and he struggles to speak just like me. I was too afraid to speak to him and looks like he was too scared to speak to me.🤦 Now after 2 years I want to shoot my shot. 

The few times I said hello to him he seemed super down to earth and I looked at his profile and it seems we would have alot in common (he shares the same spiritual beliefs, is hardworking and comes from humble beginnings like me). Idk if we are compatible but I want to try. I deeply regret not asking him out back then so I want to ask how do I shoot my shot without coming across like a weirdo. I've been having some many anxiety break downs in the last 3 days because my insecurities keep telling me he won't like me, maybe we won't have anything in common, maybe he's found someone else, what if he doesn't remember me, what if he reads my dm and immediately blocks me🥴......ahhh... I can't take it. I've been pulling my hair out for days now 🤣. So I need some advice, how do I shoot my shot to him in dm on IG without coming across too strong or weird.

We’ve met up once (we’re currently in lockdown in Sydney) and we had sex that night. I also have sent him some nudes these past few weeks a few times, sometimes without him asking. 

Now his messages are not super frequent, he’s taking a day to reply and I’m always the one to start a new conversation. I feel like maybe he wants a relationship but he only sees me sexually or thinks I don’t want a relationship.

Is there anything wrong with me, and if there is, what can I do to change so that I’m not shooting myself in the foot?","I can’t help but find guys who are dominant to be irresistible. I’m rather feisty in real life because I work in a male-dominated field where I HAVE to be outspoken in order to be recognized, but for some inexplicable reason, all of my sexual fantasies involve me being the submissive.

One of the most fun/long lasting conversations i ever had was when I was in my last year of college and I matched with a 35-year old guy on Bumble who was a successful consultant (aka he was tall, sexy, smart, and rich) - he was 150 miles away though. He definitely didn’t take me seriously because he’d send explicit messages like, “I want you be a naughty girl just for me”. When I told him I’d just returned home from a party, he’d say “Hope you had fun. Behave?” When I told him I was at the library, he’d tell “Good. Stay there”. He also offered to take me shopping and asked me to move into the spare bedroom in his condo in NYC after graduation (at the time I thought he was trolling me but apparently New Yorkers move in with each other pretty fast?).
Eventually out conversations fizzled out when I took another job in Virginia and he became nasty about it. He sent me a nude and I just never responded. 

Looking back though, I really liked him because there was a massive power imbalance. Guys who care would never say things like this guy did (would they)? I’m honestly bored by conversations about video games or polite conversations with most guys I see, and I usually feel “too” masculine in every dynamic. I feel like I missed my chance — the guy recently made partner at his firm and out of the 400 newly minted partners photos worldwide, his was the only one where there were BOOKS in the background. I also looked up his Bumble profile and his main photo has him holding the EXACT bottle of wine I’d told him was my favorite. I don’t want to be a victim of confirmation bias though.

34,p84199,dating_advice,Fri Aug 20 15:17:16 2021,Ghosting is bad and it doesn't make any sense!,"&amp;#x200B;

Let me start off by telling a little about me (32M). I had multiple long term relationships in the past, I'm good with women and people in general, outgoing and successful. As I've been single (by choice) for a while now, I enjoy the dating scene in my city where I usually go on a couple of first dates a week. I live in a big European capital and it's really not that hard to meet new people.

I've been ghosted a total of 3 times in the last year :)

The first one was last year with an American woman (35F). We had dinner, hit it off, went to a bar afterwards, then my place, had sex and she left. A total of 7 hours, not bad for a first date. Then we texted back and forth a couple times the next day, then she ghosted me. When I called her out on it, she said ""Men are so entitled sometimes"" and that she wasn't interested. Fair enough, and I'm glad I told her ""ghosting is bad"".

The second one was a few months ago, we went on a date, then she gave me her number, started sending me pics from her vacation, she then came back home and we went on a 2nd date the same day, then she ghosted when I reached out again a few days later. My response to the ghosting was, ""all the best and good luck"".

The third one was 2 days ago. I went on a first date with someone (34F), we went to a bar, had a couple of drinks, kissed, she invited me to her place, smoked some pot together, had a super hot make out session, got naked and ""almost had sex"" (lol my dick was rubbing on her clit and accidentally went inside her once and then she said she doesn't have sex on the first date and I respected it ofc), then I leave go home we text and thank each other for a fun night, and then the next evening I reach out and she ghosts me. Like seriously? Then a day later my text was this: ""Well, looks like you are not interested. I wish you'd told me instead of ghosting, as I think ghosting is a terrible thing to do. Anyway, all the best and I hope you find what you are looking for! :)"" For me this was the most mind blowing as I genuinely thought we had a good time.

Needless to say neither of these beautiful ladies blocked my number, they instead chose not to reply to me.

Anyhow, thanks for reading, I would love to hear your opinion on this. And please remember, ""ghosting is bad"" and it honestly doesn't make any sense!

5,pag0ga,dating_advice,Tue Aug 24 07:11:57 2021,"What is wrong with me and why am I not good enough [32M, Asian-American, USA]","Tldr; I like who I am and have a lot of great attributes but none of it gets a chance to be displayed because of my ugly face. How do I reconcile this feeling?


Will I ever be good enough? This may sound like another low-self esteemed guy complaining. But I want to be clear about a few things.

I think if you’ve had low success rate at anything, you would think you are not good at it. To think otherwise would be delusional. But that is not to say it is permanent and that you cannot improve! Because you can!

But to explain my mind state, we would have to look at it from a longer period of time, where I have been changing, so there’s different results at different times. But I say that to make the point that it seems like I’ve tried everything and still having little success. 

Assessing myself as honest I can—trying to limit my personal bias—I think I am a great catch! But at this point I feel like none of my positive qualities matter cuz I’m rejected before they get a chance to even know me…

I’ve never felt I was a good looking guy. Particularly my face. I’ve always been in good shape, athletic. Totally ripped at one point. But I try not to show it off like some douchebag. 

I have a ton of grit and perseverance. Overcome a lot of personal circumstances to get here. I am intelligent, got a well paying career. I’m focused on self improvement and spirituality and inner peace. I prioritize being honest and not mislead people, even if it means I don’t get what I want. I think they call that integrity or something. 

I think some other words that would describe me are: disciplined, mindful, focused, determined.

I’d like to think my communication skills are good but I am also skeptical of this, since communication is a two way street. The ways I communicate, I believe is efficient however if others are not on the same page, it doesn’t matter. So in a sense, I feel like my communication skills are being “negated” by others’ less efficient communication. I am aware of this and trying to figure out if I’m just full of myself or others just suck at communication.

This can be used as an example of a larger theme I suspect. I believe I am conducting myself in efficient manners, but the rest of the world doesn’t. So communication is even worse cuz we are not on the same page in terms of HOW to communicate. It may very well be better if I “dumbed down” myself just to be on the same page as the rest. 

Listing as most efficient way to communicate:
1. Both communicate in my method
2. Both communicate in their method
3. Both communicate in differing methods

I love basketball. I can say with certainty that I’ve spent over 10k hours playing, practicing, and studying basketball. I am my most confident self when on the courts.

I appreciate art. I like poetry. I used to and still dabble in art and poetry. I like hiphop/r&amp;b music. I like puzzles/board games/brain teasers. I like to think of my own witty jokes. I am a curious forever student. I have a great attention to detail, great memory, I can recall 100 of digits of pi or lyrics from some of the most hardcore gangsta rappers. 

I can come off as blunt/insensitive/asshole because of my honest/unfiltered mouth. I will make inappropriate jokes. (I’m also not fully convinced that this is a flaw but mismatch in personalities; my closer friends seem to understand me).

I am an introvert and don’t like big groups. I don’t drink alcohol (aka the de facto adult activity) so I don’t go to bars much. I’m not a dancer so I’ve never been to any clubs either. 

I can be pretty black and white about things. 

I’ve never been in a relationship. partly because of my whole family/at home situations that I don’t think it wise to bring someone else into. Maybe I don’t deserve to be loved..? But of course the self esteem thing too. 

I have an above average sized member and the women I’ve been with seemed to be impressed. And they seem thoroughly satisfied with my ability to use it. 

I’m a deep thinker and can see both sides of issues impartially. I think this can be interpreted as passive and indecisive. Or that I am against the person I’m talking to. A lot of times we don’t have the luxury of time to explain our whole thought process to one another. Most people usually favor one side passionately. I also wonder about the difference between being opinionated and judgmental.

I love who I am. But I also lament that I am not like the good looking, loud, lively, outgoing extroverted people (aka “the popular kids”)

I am tired. I’ve worked so hard to get where I am now—school, career, financially, and last and most importantly myself. But damn wtf it feels like I worked so hard and I’m still not good enough. 

Because of all the shit I’ve been through, I learned to be optimistic and find silver linings. I had to. I know this negative thoughts are not indicative of that guy but It’s what I’m feeling now. 

I’m not sure if I’m ugly or average? I’ve been called handsome, cute. But I feel like those are weak words. I’ve been complimented on my style. I’ve never been called sexy, fiione, hot, kyooote. I think I’m a pretty good catch otherwise. And still improving. But I don’t want a woman to be like he’s got everything I want except that he’s ugly in the face.

25,pc2li7,dating_advice,Thu Aug 26 19:08:02 2021,7 year relationship - move out or stay living together to make it work?,"Recently broke up with bf of 7 years. We were engaged for 2 and lived together for 5. At the core, we are a team and support each other. However, our differing views on humanity and some differing values were taking a toll on me. He is more judgemental of others and I'm more open minded and free. He cuts down my views and is quite pessimistic on humanity in general. We also have poor communication, where I voice needs (like sex) and get eye rolls and told I'm nagging. I started not saying anything and then had built up resentment so I got critical of everything he did (like chewing loud). 

When we broke up, he said he now sees everything clearly and wanted to work on it. I had enough and we slept in separate beds and i basically tried to start a new life. 

We continued to eat dinner together and errands and go out etc. 

Now that our lease renewal is coming up...i started looking into places of my own. We live in NYC so finding a place is competitive and TOUGH. Finally, a place I saw online, I walked by and the realtor happened to be there..he gave me an app and I got conditionally approved (co-op). 

I CRIED AND CRIED. Suddenly, all the good in our relationship came flashing back and I'm worried I'm making the wrong choice. 

He says we can stay together and live apart..and try therapy. But seems like a BIG waste of money and stress.  He is also willing to live in our same apartment and do therapy...

Over the last year: my grandma who raised me passed away, covid happened, moved to new city, started a super intense  job that is so stressful i barely eat, and now this...

72,pdywp3,dating_advice,Sun Aug 29 19:52:13 2021,Taking it slow or stringing me along,"I've been dating this guy for 2.5 months.
In the beginning we were together quite frequently (5-6 days/week). In the past 2 weeks it's been less than that, maybe once a week due to home circumstances. We still message frequently and plan dates.
In the past I've mentioned exclusivity in the sense us not seeing other people. I brought this up because whenever we were together he was always future talking (""when you meet my parents"", ""i go on these trips a lot so I hope you're ok with coming along on these types of things""). Also the fact we are in Australian lockdown and I am his single bubble buddy and he also refers to me as intimate partner (restriction terminology). So I thought it appropriate to ask to be exclusive.
He said he was not ready for that and felt it was rush.
He said he still wished to explore us but also wasn't closed off to the idea of seeing other connections.
I had stopped using apps at this point in time. And he stated it would have been easier if I remained on them but understands I'm a ""one man kind of girl"". I reflected and realised maybe I had rushed the topic of exclusivity because lockdown and our time together sped things up. I also realised that after this he seemed more distant and the energy wasn't the same as it once was.
I mentioned getting back on the apps more to just explore my wants/needs in dating and relationships. I reassured that my focus was on us dating and progressing slowly. He was quite happy when I mentioned getting back on the apps and even made the comment that maybe I'll find someone who is better suited and that it's ok. It didn't make me feel great.
I've been open and honest with him in communicating if I'm going on a date. He's very much not the same but whatever
But I noticed since I started the apps he's made more of a effort with me and what before felt like he was retreating now feels like he's interested again.
From discussing my dates he realised that I've actually got a fair amount lined up, and he was taken aback by this and asked my intentions again. I reassured him it was just to explore my wants/needs in relationships and with people.
He was very happy and reassuring me that he did want to see where this goes and just wanted to take it slowly.
In the last I've raised concern about being used for sex and he is forthcoming with initiating it. And I've tried slowing that part down because it seems to be the one thing that's remained at a fast pace.

I had a date. It went well and he was nice enough. I didn't feel physical chemistry but felt comfortable. He asked for a second and I said yes but was unsure about the boundary regarding the other guy. I brought it up to him and he said that he didn't want to hold me back from what I wanted, and had no issues.
He said he wasn't actively seeking out new connections at the moment. Is still wanting to see where we go but wants to go slowly. 
And I guess I got confused and am over analysing the situation and specific terminology used. 
It seems so on/off and hot/cold that I'm confused where I stand.
I told him it was best to speak in person and he agreed. 

I guess the thing that hits most is him feeling he doesn't want to hold me back from what I want, when I've been explicit in saying I just want to explore us. And felt slightly pushed into dating again.
And then the fact he says he's not seeking out new connections ""at the moment"" - I have anxiety and so this sets me off like at some point he's going to say that he still wants to take it slowly with me but also has dates. 
And I feel like in the beginning it was ok but as we progress forward for myself I'd hope to just it be us focusing on our relationship and not dating other people.

We are going to talk in person and I've already told him the main things I wish to talk about 1. What does slowly mean for him 2. What does relationship progression look/feel like for him

I think it's hard in lockdown because things were sped up for a good month when I basically lived with him. And the fact we can't conventionally date.
But it just seems like he's all over the shop with his intentions and I'm left just as confused",/r/dating_advice/comments/pdywp3/taking_it_slow_or_stringing_me_along/,3

This is gonna be a long post but I defiantly could use your advice so thank you for reading through as I’m really struggling lately and could use some help.
Along with many other problems involving me (21m) and her (19f) there is a new one that she is agreeing she is wrong on but I’m getting sick of the laundry list of problems and want some opinions.

A little background. Her and I have known eachother for three years. We originally dated for about a year then we broke up and she started dating someone she said was just a friend. When we first dated there were only a couple major issues. When we first started dating she kept talking to her ex that she said only hit her up for sex and after I complained she kept doing it until I complained again and the other thing is she kissed a girl on New Year’s Eve while we were dating and posted a video of it (she’s bi) why I let that slide idk.but after we broke up and dated the new guy she said was just a friend She totally replaced me with him in every way kinda of ruining anything special we had and they even got matching tattoos. He left her 6 months in and she came and used me for attention and told me there was a chance and then on the last day I saw her last June (2020) when this happened she went and fucked Him right after me on the same day (i know this because she made a tik tok bragging about it, there will be more tik toks to talk about ) she messaged me while they were dating about how amazing he was and how I wasn’t even close to ever making her as happy as he did. Well they broke up a couple months later. During last summer she also accused me of rape which never happened and she admitted she did because she was hurt. She however was supposedly raped by someone else but kept hanging out with him after cause he bought her alcohol. 

She then changed her lifestyle even more and became someone I wouldn’t want to be with. She was a party girl who would occasionally sleep with random guys and she even smoked with meth a couple times last summer as well.  She fucked the drug dealer abs sucked off his gun during sex and made a post bragging about it on tik tok which blew up leading to her Making content like that.We dated for like a month in March until I found out about her new lifestyle and then I ended it and then she told me she changed so we gave it another shot two months ago. Between two months ago and when we broke up in March she has been sending nudes to this guy and still had him on her phone when we got back together She lied about taking him off her phone which I just found out. During the two months that we just dated she was pretty cold and distant. She still has the matching tat with the guy she dated last year and said she wanted it gone as much as I did. I complained about it many times but she always made an excuse to not get it off. She would say she didn’t know where to go or that she didn’t have money but also would pay to go get new tats done.She admits to mistreating me. At one point when I brought up last issues she got upset and told me I was immature and to get over it (she apologizes for saying this in the heat of the moment) so the relationship had been very rocky for awhile and I was considering breaking up with her and I told her I wasn’t happy for a couple weeks before the end. We broke up last week because I found out she was still following some guy she used to fuck and I’m not ok with that as she had complained about people I followed and then never unfollowed anyone herself. She attempted suicide when I broke up with her and I had to save her and call the police. 

The hard part of all of this is I was working to forgive her for the past cause she said she has changed and even tho I didn’t mention it I have my own problems and I was so bad to her before the first time we broke up. We both seem to love eachother and we’re planning to move to nyc together in a month . I’m still going and she has moved back home to get professional help for her mental health issues. She admits her wrongs now and says she’s trying to change. 
The newest problem is that I just started following her spam Instagram a week ago and she had pictures up that she took that you could see pictures of her and her old boyfriend in them. I complained about them and unfollowed. I followed her spam again today and they are still up and she tried saying that it wasn’t a big cause cause they arnt acutely pictures even tho you can clearly see them kissing in it and it makes me uncomfortable. She then apologized and took them down. 

Seems to me like there is a pattern of lying,disloyalty,selfishness and a lot of other shit with her that is bad for me. 

So even though we won’t be dating for awhile as I’m moving and she will be getting help do you think when she moves to nyc in a couple months it’s worth giving anther shot since if she actually gets better or do you think due to the past I should move on even tho I haven’t lost love in three years? 

I know this post was long and I appreciate anyone who read through us and is helping me through the hardest time of my life.",/r/dating_advice/comments/pe254k/hardest_choice/,5
