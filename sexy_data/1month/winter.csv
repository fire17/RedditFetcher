 *That‚Äôs it. Period. No amount of racism is ok, not ever. Being racist makes you scum of the earth. Racism has hurt so many, ESPECIALLY BIPOC in america. I cannot stress it enough, racism is horrible, it‚Äôs terrible. If you aren‚Äôt actively combating racism, you‚Äôre just as bad as racists. Silence is violence. BLACK LIVES MATTER.

*P.S. Mods, if you really stand AGAINST hate, you will support this thread. Time to see if this sub is another hate sub or not...*

*Edit: It has become very apparent to me that this sub is very much not anti hate.*

but in my opinion, looks like this  
 *Guess what dude, ALL. LIVES. MATTER.*

*that is it period. True that racism is not ok, but that doesnt mean signal out one race. Signaling out just one race is a bit scummy dont you think? Yeah racism hurts a lot of people, but doesnt mean signal out one group of people just because they happen to be a different color. Even if people arent for/agains racism doesnt make them as bad as racists, it doesnt change them. And just bc people dont have say, doesnt make it violence, i dont give much say but that doesnt mean anything. Yeah, black lives matter, but so do everyone else. and you say as you like, go ahead say fuck the police and see what becomes of your sorry ass when things get fucked.*

*All lives matter, fight me. and not all of us are racist and think different of those who are different. Please just look at both sides of the argument*

90,kq6h5c,teenagers,Mon Jan  4 12:56:15 2021,Why I feel like I'm treated badly.,"A warning: This post includes my views about culture, gender, sex and race, in relation to me. I'm not here to say that any of these things are entirely bad, just give my views on them and get some help with it.

Recently, I've seen a lot of things posted on reddit and twitter about feminism and I dont understand why it exists like it does. For example, Ive seen people saying stuff along the lines of 'A good relationship includes: Putting your wife first, above your parents, survival etc, worshipping your wife and (paraphrasing) bending to her will and I think its bullshit. None of those conditions sound lile an equal relationship. Why do feminists want equal rights when they try to opress men to nothing. It doesnt make sense, and they dont stop to question what they are doing, and with most people these days, jump to conclusions before thinking.

Im not saying feminism is bad, I think they should have  the same rights, *and* responsibilities as men. I think the strongest example I've seen proving extremes are taken, is a dispute a bunch of year 7 students had over womens rights. Take these with a grain of salt as most of the arguments given here are quit dumb. These quotes are not exact.

'At least women dont choose to become dirty, grubby tradies like men'. I had to start with this one because it pisses me off. I live in Australia, and as far as I'm aware, we have hundreds of thousands of tradeswomen at work. And, without these workers, the jobs that women 'choose' to do cant function.

'Men dont have it hard, women get raped so much and men dont' Yes, women get raped more then men and according to the western australian goverments heath department, more that 700 thousand women get raped compared to men. But that doesnt change the fact that women are as much at fault here than men.

Rasicm. Please. Stop. All of you. Every single person on this planet, needs to think about what they are saying. For several reasons. Lets start with my opinion on the topic, dark skinned people (unsure of the polite term) are racist too. Sure, caucasians are racist sometimes. But that doesnt mean that the victim is innocent. Calling the police on a dark skinned person is not racist, if they did something wrong. Same for fair skinned people. White supremacy is no longer a thing. It was pre 1960s (may be different depending on your country) but thats long changed. Who gives a shit what colour you are, if you knew me, and painted myself black, you wouldnt treat me differently. All our choices come from an internal part of the body, which cant be seen and we should not let our visuals affect us. Racism is bad, but we are shooting the wrong enemy.

As for gender...
Why should we give two figs about what someone thinks they are and why should they give two figs about what someone else thinks they are.

'You should be ashamed for being straight, all you think   about is fucking women and its gross. You being straight is a disgrace to human society.' 
I got told this, to my face. This is a blatent example of stupidity. It doesnt matter if your part of the LGBTQ+ community, or straight. If your a different sex, or gender. You have no right, whatsoever to say this to *anyone*. Its rude. And it gives me a bad view of your community.

My problem:
If you read all of that, kudos. I may have bias views on some things, maybe i didnt clarify enough or I just dont agree with you, but thats ok. These are my thoughts.

I want to know why this happens and why people give me, a Caucasian male, shit about it. Please share your thoughts with me.

1,kqmi7m,teenagers,Tue Jan  5 02:48:36 2021,Yay woohooo parents supper arrived yay at yipee,"I‚Äôm about 11 into piano and will be doing a level 10 RCM(royal conservatory of music) exam soon. This year was special since we have a bit of a virus situation so they guys at RCM let us record our entire music and send it over by video ( I‚Äôm not gonna explain it‚Äôs complicated). Of course like any person would, I tend to get nervous whenever the real thing comes around. And OH BOY LUCKY ME! My parents, 2 unbelievably enthusiastic belittlers just decide to start their ritual of d√©moralisation on me. (My ass got nervous and fucked up many pieces) My exam is barely in 3 weeks and they decide to pull this shit. Not in one of those 6 years of piano exams and competitions have they said something wee bit positive about my accomplishments. No ‚Äúnice job man, I‚Äôm proud of you, keep it up buddy‚Äù no none of that shit.

60,kqtd9s,teenagers,Tue Jan  5 09:35:12 2021,justifying being a lazy piece of shit - apparently writing a rant has become a nightly occurrence in my life," ‚ÄúLazy‚Äù used to be such a clear cut term for me. It was so black and white. To me, being lazy was simply a choice. That choice was a reflection of your character, of your worth to society. I‚Äôd hold myself in such high esteem for being prototypically ‚Äúsmart‚Äù and ‚Äúhard working‚Äù. That quickly changed in 8th grade where all of a sudden the idea of work filled my mind with disgust and contempt. Who knows what changed in me, but from that point on I‚Äôve avoided schoolwork like the plague. Any attempt at putting in any semblance of effort is quickly thwarted by some easily accessible meaningless distraction. Naturally, my parents quickly started putting more pressure on me and I was wracked with guilt as a result. Yet despite all this guilt and pressure, I somehow managed to start doing even less. The guilt transformed into self hate which started manifesting itself through all kinds of negative, self deprecating thoughts. Eventually I began to reciprocate these shitty thoughts through self harm. All I remember is endlessly pinching myself and running this exacto knife I‚Äôd found against my skin as I spiralled down the rabbit hole of overwhelming emotion every night. 

Enough of this pussy ass sob story, where the fuck am I going with this? I think my initial idea was to pour out my thoughts regarding ‚Äúmotivation‚Äù and what a shitty work mentality society perpetuates. It‚Äôs almost like ‚Äúgrinding‚Äù and overworking yourself is fetishized these days. The conversation amongst my nerdy college board dick sucking group of friends would endlessly revolve around what work they had to do and what work they‚Äôd already done while I sat there figuring out how I was gonna pass biology. Who knows how this mindset came about, it probably has something to do with the advancement of technology and increased need for specialized fields which necessitated college degrees. The American mentality being something along the lines of ‚Äúwork hard, get rewarded‚Äù meant going to college was your pipeline out of financial mediocrity. Furthermore the influx of demand for college degrees only fostered unhealthy competition which paved the path for stupid AP courses and endless extracirriculars so that you could have a leg up above your competition. What happened to the 50s and being able to support a family on the salary of a car mechanic? Anyhow, I‚Äôm too uneducated to continue speaking on this subject because I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs some economics professor out there willing to write a thousand word book on this topic. I‚Äôm probably half wrong about the whole thing anyway. Only thing I do know is that society disgustingly fetishizes work. 

So now that I‚Äôve established the fact that our society facilitates a toxic work mentality, I‚Äôm gonna delve into my nonsensical ramblings about how motivation is intrinsic, and not necessarily a choice. Hell, nothing is a choice. Surely we are all just a product of an inconceivable amount of variables that dictate every little decision in our life, but the thought of free will not existing is just depressing. My mom says ‚ÄúNone of us like to work, but we do it anyway because we know it's necessary to sustain a happy lifestyle‚Äù. But I can tell myself that I need to work for my own sake, I can feel all the guilt in the world for procrastinating, but at the end of the day if that doesn‚Äôt trigger the desire to do work, what will? I don‚Äôt want to deflect accountability for being a lazy person, but seriously, how can I force myself to work? Is it not just an intrinsic desire that is activated through some seemingly infinite amount of variables in your life? And sure, objectively speaking, working hard makes you a better human. That‚Äôs understandable, but how can you berate me and pressure me when it‚Äôs clear nothing is going to magically activate my intrinsic motivation. Just accept that I do not function like other productive individuals and let me live out my sad life working at Walmart. Quit fucking antagonizing me. It‚Äôs up to me to do something with my life, and ultimately working hard my entire life to have a job I hate isn‚Äôt gonna make me any happier than working 40 hours a week at Walmart living in a flat with some dirty ass hobo roommate. We all work our shitty lives away so that we can survive and reproduce, let me choose how the fuck I‚Äôm gonna do it. 

Well I‚Äôm not sure if this entire rant made sense. There is always some different way to analyze something, some way to manipulate words to follow whatever narrative you want them to. You can justify just about anything, and this is just my way of justifying why I‚Äôm a lazy little fuck.",/r/teenagers/comments/kqtd9s/justifying_being_a_lazy_piece_of_shit_apparently/,2
83,kqyk7s,teenagers,Tue Jan  5 15:34:53 2021,The Greatest and Most Epic Anime Battle to Ever Exist,"So it began on a warm Australian night. Me and my bro are doing the last chores before bed. I'm about to go brush my teeth when my bro challenges me to a 1v1 by kicking his foot up my arse. ""Exposition flashback"" My younger bro is extremely buff after deciding that he wanted to become the hulk when he was 4, prayed to god to let this happen, and has gymed every day since then to improve his strength, while i played New Super Mario Bros on the ds and improved in intellect rather than strength. So knowing full well i was at a physical  disadvantage went to even the playing fields by giving him a sacc tap, but his beefy arse fore arm swung at the same to hit me with a wooden stick, my hand bent back to a point i felt immense pain for a good 5 minutes. Now fun fact, whilst a may be weaker, i have a far greater pain thresh hold than my bro, and thanks to newtons third law of physics, he felt both the force of my wrist flick and some of the force of his thicc ass fore arm. He yelped in pain, and was destracted just long enough for me to use the secret joestar technique, GTFO and get to the kitchen and open living room. He returned faster than i thought, but that was not the problem, the problem was, the thick, plastic, bendy straw he was holding. Similarly to you, ""how could this straw do any damage"", well i gound out after it firt hit it stung, it really stung and it was fast enough that it could both combo and avoid being grabbed, so i grabbed a blanket and threw it at him. He swung wildly un able to hit me, i then hit him with a sacc tap, and nothing. He threw away the blanket and said, ""I perceived your attack"", as he jumped onto the couch, revealing his three pairs of underpants, ""it's over, I have the high ground"", did i just get out smarted, no becuase i put smarted his out smarting. ""I wonder where you straw went"" i said, he looked around his person confused, i whipped out the straw and threw it far away, and then he body slammed me. He weighs 63.65 kg of pure muscle at 165 cm tall where as i weigh 57 kg at 175.5 cm tall, so his height to thicc ratio is definitely more impressive than mine, so to say i was getting my cheeks clapped is an understatement. See my bro was doing this all shirtless (no homo, no chromo), and he had one weakness exposed, the nips, so i twisted those nips until he rolled over. We both stood up in pain and in shamble, knowing that is would not end I had to follow my life motto and my special attack, the only attack known to mankind that can both assert dominance and cause your enemy to retreat. I pulled down my pants and started to helicopter my cock, thats right my life motto is if in doubt whip it out, he was so intimidated that he screamed ""I surrender"" and ran to his room. I stood victorious.

TLDR: Read the post you lazy shit.

24,kr6c45,teenagers,Tue Jan  5 21:59:31 2021,Is it normal to have a crush like this on celebrity‚Äôs?,"I have one fantasy about Nikki Minaj.

I have one fantasy about Nikki Minaj. I want to somehow be noticed by her and she'll fall in absolute love with me and we become lovers. Then one day we go on a cruise and the ship sinks and by some miracle we are the only 2 that survive and we end up swimming to an island with food and water resources. Enough to survive long enough and we would pass the few weeks by having sex the entire time. Eventually some wreckage would wash up and it would be enough to build a float and navigate our way back to land, the only catch is, its only big enough for one person. I sacrifice myself and let Nikki use the float to get back to land in America. With my remaining resources, I survive another 6 months and end up being saved by fishermen. They take me back to America. While on the boat I turn on the news and I see an interview of Nikki saying how she's the only person who survived and how she did it by swimming to an island and she exaggerates about how harsh it was by herself and how she built a raft by herself and floated back. She totally leaves me out of the story and mentions how she hates men and didn't need one to help her on the island. She becomes an icon for strong independent women, and has an album about it and it sells out shows across the country. Outraged, i find the next concert and find out what hotel she's staying at and what room. I sneak into her room and wait for her to return after the show. She sees a sillhouette in a spinny chair and asks ""who's there? I'm gonna call security"" then i spin around revealing its me and she is in complete awe. After some catching up, we spend the rest of the night drinking and fucking. As i'm railing her from behind, I approach the greatest nut ever so I pull out and hotdog my dick between her giant ass and right as I'm cumming, i grab the lamp off of the nightstand and cave her skull in

This is how I envision it: I‚Äôm a dirty little american soldier that ends up being captured by the Nazis. To avoid execution, I volunteer myself to be Hitler‚Äôs obedient fuck-toy. 

For days, I allow Hitler to chain me up and obliterate all of my orifices like they‚Äôre little Polands, constantly filling them with his aryan seed until his cock is stroked raw. 

Hell, he even gives me the pleasure to lick his puckered german booty clean after he takes insane nuclear shits. Due to me not getting bathroom access, I constantly shit and piss myself, but Hitler is generous enough to be my personal cleanup, licking it all up and staining his beautiful mustache. 

After building up trust and showing my obedience, he unchains me and allows me to fuck his brains out, cursing in pleasure as he yells out, ‚ÄúYA SHOVE IT REICH UP MY ASS!‚Äù. I‚Äôm generous enough to give him a reach around, cranking his throbbing war machine. 

I feel him tighten up as he reaches climax, but I let go of his thick ramrod as he begins to spew his nuclear ejaculate all over the floor. Hitler repeatedly yells out ‚ÄúNEIN! NEIN! NEIN! NEIN!‚Äù through his moans while he suffers through his ruined orgasm. At this point the tables have turned. 

He tries to fight me off, but I pin him down and powerfully thrust my all-american cock harder into his poop chute as blood begins to build up and gush out of his torn asshole. I can‚Äôt contain myself any longer, so I quickly pull out my 1911 and put a bullet through the back of Hitler‚Äôs head. Brain matter and skull fragments paint the wall, which makes me break through to my climax. 

I raise my right arm up to the ceiling. I yell out ‚ÄúSEIG HEIL!‚Äù as my cock begins to rapidly pulsate. I quickly thrust my cock to the hilt deep inside of him. I throw my head back with a loud ‚ÄúFUUUUCK!‚Äù as I spew what feels like a gallon of american semen deep inside his german asshole. 

I pull my bloody cock out of his booty tube and watch in excitement as my thick load begins to leak out of his ass. Heavily breathing, I fall back and begin to fade out, as I watch a group of american soldiers burst into the room, guns drawn. 

I wake up in the hospital, in which I‚Äôm told that I‚Äôm praised as an american hero for stopping World War 2.",/r/teenagers/comments/kriili/hear_me_out/,11

But abuse and child rape go beyond what even most of the most despicable and vile humans would ever be able to conceive as in any way ok.

I just had a conversation with a 14 year old girl who was being sexually abused by her father who threatened to rape her while her mother ignored her cries. She said, and hopefully meant it, that I had given her courage to contact CPS or other authorities to get herself and her baby sibling away from her parents. But I have no clue and just NEED to beg people to listen.

If any of you are in a similar situation or know someone who is I'm truly begging you to call these numbers or help give the resources and courage to victims. These are just a few resources in the United States. If anyone, American or otherwise needs help or wants to discuss anything I'm free most days and will check up on messages ASAP. If none of these work using your Emergency Services number is perfectly legal for situations of even suspected domestic violence and abuse. Please do whatever you can to spread the word of an issue which is constantly plaguing our world and should take priority over every, in-comparison, petty domestic and international political issue.

The unbridled hatred and anger is just overwhelming. As a young south african, who is both queer and a woman, to see this much emboldened rage is horrifying.

How has it been left to this extent that millions of people have genuinely bought into a cult and want to set up a dictatorship based on extremist isolatory ideals? Trump's doctrine is just openly racist, sexist, ableist, homophobic, xenophobic, etc.

I think one of the most bizarre elements is how much of a Christian buy-in he has, when he is so far from what the actual ideals of Christianity. How did this happen? I feel like the divide in media has created such a chasm between groups that it seems almost insurmountable. I had a deaf 85+ old church lady tell me I was ""indoctrinated by liberal propaganda"" because I disagreed with her saying that ""Trump was anointed by God to save Christianity, and bring the Bible back into the White House."" because he is apparently ""pro-life and anti-sex"" and has stopped full-term abortions happening. What??????????

????????????
It's like we exist in totally seperate realities. You guys must have experienced things like this, and I'd really appreciate some insight because this is just baffling.

Before I start I just wanted to tell everyone *I'**m not Political* but some of my family is and it's annoying and sad to see a rift caused between members due to their political standing.    


Well, where to start? Last year was pretty shitty considering a majority of us had to stay inside (Or didn't care and said fuck it) but I'm writing this today to express some emotions I had bottled up for the past say...I think since March or May of last year.   


But anyways to why were all here-   
I'm fucking tired of politics. Like, One one side you have a bunch of bumbling SJW dick heads who think they know how a black person feels because they're great uncle sister on their mom's side has a black friend and they think they're oppressed like their in fucking slavery and on the other hand you have trump supporting circle jerks who think the president is their ""Daddy UwU"" Like bro I'm tired of seeing these two fightings. I'm tired of reading the news and one side is only getting flacked for what they believed in.   
I can't lie when I say I agree with republicans storming the capital hill. American's like those crazy mother fuckers taken a lot of shit from being fucked over and overall 2020 because their private business couldn't stay alive during this bullshit of a quarantine. I don't condone it but no one seems to know if they didn't do it for trump they could have avoided legal action and possibly an Epstine like death in the future.   


I don't like how people are behaving now too. Everyone's too much of a follower because they want to be famous.   
people don't do what they love anymore unless they really stick with it.   
Some girls got no loyalty anymore  
It's harder to date for me now even though I'm not that bad looking.   
Most of the chicks in my dating pool got dicks   
I begin to realize how unobtainable my old 90's shitboxes' are (The big 3 jdm cars)  
Everything is over-politicized to have people up in arms against their brothers and sisters  
Politicians are not for the people anymore  
Creativity is dead in anything American made.   
I'm too early to explore space and too young to experience the prime of car culture.

38,kxruum,teenagers,Fri Jan 15 12:21:51 2021,Nobody cares but,"Transgender and gender identity essay

&amp;#x200B;

 

Picture a village in the past. Viking era. Think of the gender roles, the men going out, hunting, and fighting while the women stay at home. These are social constructs, they have scientific reasonings and backgrounds, but they are implemented by people in a society and therefore social constructs. This is now what I am getting to, gender being a social construct. When a man looked at a woman and said she was different to him or vice versa, they are not creating things like I had previously mentioned but one would simply be pointing out science. The science being that men and women are different. This has and is what gender is, a reflection on differences between us because of certain things and us as human beings being categorized as a result of these differences. It makes sense, right?¬† 

That is what you would think but the left's idea of this seems to differ from mine. The left loves humanism and being logical and scientific but in this case, they are undeniably wrong. As a result, they turn to gender being a 'social construct'. This way they get to bypass science as it does not suit them. However, as I already mentioned gender is not a construct of humans but something that has always been, and humans only pointed out. This is where it gets more controversial even though it is science and fact.¬† 

Now that it has been established that there are many differences between men and women, it can be confidently said that there is no way for one person on one side of this to suddenly jump to the other. In this day and age, we see 'transgender' people, but do they really change genders? I said one can't change gender but now people are changing gender? Quite confusing isn't it? Well not really. Gender dysphoria is a diagnosable mental illness and rightly so. These people are delusional to think they can change something like gender. As mentioned already, there are big differences between both males and females. Transgender people only change aesthetically. For this example, I will take a man. He gets more feminine qualities by getting plastic surgery on his buttocks and breasts. He wears more feminine clothes. Grows out his hair. Make up. Cheekbones. Jewlery. Might even go as far as changing genetalia yet it's not the same as a female‚Äôs. Transgenders don't have menstrual cycles. Sorry, was that offensive? Let me rephase; they don't have WOMENstrual cycles :). So, everything I have mentioned is aesthetic. The left shouts and cries about toxic masculinity and says a man can dress like a woman while still being a man, but when a trans person does exactly that they are in fact woman and not man. What I am saying is gender is not about clothes, or what you do for a living but rather internal things, things you cannot change. For example, a transgender man who thinks he is a woman can get prostate cancer; 'Yes, trans women and non-binary people assigned male at birth can get prostate cancer.'- prostatecanceruk.org. There are many more differences between men and women such as the brain. Any half-educated person knows there are differences between mens‚Äô and womens' brains for example the way information is processed, including feelings. You can quote me on that, it is science and what one would hope is also common sense, but sadly it is not. Another example is chromosomes. Back to my example, a man may look like a woman but internally, he will never be a woman.¬† 

It is quite simply defying science and anti-science to think so and why transgender people are delusional. A man can have feminine qualities but that does not make him a woman in any shape of form and people only stand for this flawed logic to facilitate for these people's feelings and anybody with sense would know that a world run on emotions and feelings would not be a good place to live in. And that is what I have done here, I have provided facts and evidence backing up my points, which are not thoughts, they are facts. I can already hear the barking. I would much rather live in a good world and have to offend 0.42% of the population (based off the USA, a very advanced country as far as LGBT is concerned) and be able to live in a world without delusion and a world who acknowledges science and does not bypass this science in ANY circumstance needed to try keep their point relevant.¬† 

Even if we are to allow such stupidity in our world, why does it have to be taught to children. HBO's new movie ""Transhood"" features many trans kids, some as young as 4. These children have no say in their gender but rather the parents are forcing this. Why is underage sexual intercourse illegal? Obvious isn't it, children are too young and not smart enough to do something like that. So why is it that a child can try to change their gender? This has even more downsides than sexual intercourse. There are parents like the ones in the movie all over the world, giving hormone blockers to their children. It is not hard to find people of the left advocating this in countries like America and Sweden. This is disgusting. It can and will affect children in their futures with things like stunting growth. Based off this why is it ok for an adult to give hormone blockers and hormones to children but it's not ok for adults to engage in intercourse with a child? It may seem like I want to decriminalize pedophilia, but I don't. I strongly believe that adults making life changing decisions like these should be prosecuted with multiple charges including drugging. I've heard many voices from the left say ""let them do what they want. Be supportive. If you won't do that then don't have children"" and this horrifies me. Children are learning about the world around them. They are malleable. If you tell a young boy that he can be a girl when he is growing up, then when he is grown up, he will think he can be a girl. Children absorb knowledge like a sponge and so if you say that they want to do it then that is not a reason because they are only children, and this is the same with sex.¬† 

It may sound odd talking a lot about children having sex, but it is undeniably a similar comparison. If that however was not enough there are statistics backing my claim up. On average 80% of children change their minds and do not continue into adulthood as transgender.'  - https://www.transgendertrend.com/children-change-minds/ and this is obviously not a right leaning source. If you are to drug your child and put them through a drastic change in their lives, there is an 80% chance that they will regret that. Why? BECAUSE CHILDREN KNOW NO BETTER. This is a leading factor for the horrific stat of 22% - 43% of transgender people having attempted to kill themselves (suicideinfo.ca) with 89% having thought about it and 72% percent having self-harmed at least once (stonewall.org.uk). It is not specified what is counted as self-harm as that can be quite vague, but these stats are bad. What's worrying is that parents can set a child up for this and not face repercussions. The left wants people to 'just allow it' and reserve telling people the truth as this may hurt their feelings but by letting people live in fantasy world they are being put at risk of these horrible things.¬†

59,l0akbq,teenagers,Tue Jan 19 04:57:26 2021,2 years of being a virgin,"There ya have it, I own two blue pieces of cheese, they're so moldy, my father came in and beat me with a belt. Anyway, I am here to tell you to love yourself, you are most likely a pretty radical dude. If you feel depressed, remember: there's like, 80 more years of your lifespan, average, and a lot of things can happen in one month, let alone a year. You genuinely matter, and you've genuinely made an impact on so many people, before you make any rash decisions, please visit a therapist or talk to someone on the phone, you'll get through this. 

If you're struggling with sexual orientation / what you identify as, there's plenty of communities to thrive in, the first step towards happiness is acceptance (if you have discord, Teamagers is a hella good server, even if you're cis and straight). If your friends won't accept you, they're not your friends and they're missing out. If your family won't accept you, if they're smart, they'll come around, if they're that ignorant that they won't, family isnt bound by blood, so it's up to you what you want to do and what will make you happier.    

If you don't enjoy school, find a hobby, or a (when Covid dies down) afterschool activity, or join a club. Finding things you love and others who also love them is an amazing feeling and will make your days faster and more fun.      

If you're struggling to find a relationship, you're &lt; 20! Dont rush things cuz your friend got a wholesome relationship or a beneficial one, and I can tell ya, a beneficial relationship isnt as good as it might sound, especially if you never even kissed someone.  It'll be better if you wait until you find a better community if you're in a crappy one.   

If you wanna build a gaming pc, AMD is cheaper and better than intel, at least for budget pcs.  

If you wanna get into guitar, Fender makes squeir (butchered it) guitars for cheap prices, and if you change the pickups on their strats, they'll sound pretty close to an American strat, also, a $200 guitar sounds better on a $500 amp, and a $1,500 guitar wont sound as good as that $200 one if you're playing it on a $100 amp, that's for electric, I've got no clue when it comes to acoustic or bass. There's also A Modern Theory of Guitat vol 1-3 for like, $20 and it's so good for teaching yourself guitar. After all that, it's only a matter of finding inspiration and practicing every day.  

Alrighty, what else can I spit out of my mouth before the mods ban me for being a boomer? 

Uhhhhh

Ranking system for men, coming from a bi boy. 

&gt; Hot &lt; Playboy &lt; Handsome &lt; Cute &lt; Twink &lt; Femboy &lt; Catboy &lt; Witches, anything after cute will attract the wrong crowd most of the time tho if you're straight.

Also, pedos, yes you you fucking curly haired boomer. Liking minors is hella sus, basically everyone here hates you, thinks you should burn, yadda yadda yadda. Anyway, go seek some psychological help, they wont arrest you, and you're seeking help to be a better person. Once you're a better person, you dont have to resort to children to get off, you could have an actual wholesome relationship you dreamt of when you were young and couldnt be drafted into war.

31,l1j82b,teenagers,Wed Jan 20 23:38:28 2021,"I turn 20 IN 3 hours, but I want to leave some parting advice of things I‚Äôve learnt through my teenage years.","As the title says I‚Äôm turning 20 years old. I have learned a lot being a teenager, it‚Äôs the prime of our lives, it‚Äôs where we finish secondary school, get our first part-time job, choose a university, or leave school and get a full-time job.
Personally, I have learnt a lot, most of it is from my own experiences but I wish someone else had told me earlier on before I found out for myself. I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm leaving this sub forever; I‚Äôll give myself the ‚Äúold‚Äù tag and give advice where I think I could be of help. I would still like to write the bulk of what I‚Äôve learned here to help you. 
1.	I see a lot of posts about mental health and suicide and you need to know it‚Äôs okay not to be okay. Help is out there I love helping people I enjoy it, so please message me if you need help. I to have felt depressed at times, one major thing about me is that I care too much about what people think about me, if someone has a problem I want to know why. If you‚Äôre like this too learn to let things roll of your back and ignore them. 
2.	Stop worrying about relationships at 13 to 16 years old, at the time of writing this I haven‚Äôt had a girlfriend yet nor anything even close, nothing lasted more than a night 2 days at the most. We will all find someone at some point. I have thought about losing my virginity to a prostitute, it might fun, and I shouldn‚Äôt regret it, but I probably would.  
3.	Do well in school, one of my biggest regrets is being too busy trying to be the funny popular guy trying to be everyone‚Äôs friend, I failed at both having a huge circle of friends and failed school as well. 
4.	Your school grades don‚Äôt define who you are. There are plenty of options for you to take and still do what you want to do but doing as well as you can in school will make doing what you want easier.
5.	Get a part time job once you are old enough. Even if it a volunteer job it will give you much needed work experience that will help you eventually get a paid job. Also looks good on a university application. Try and avoid customer service for your first!
6.	Save up your money. I understand once you start working you might be tempted to spend your money on new games or PC upgrades I know I was, and that‚Äôs ok, it‚Äôs nice to treat ourselves every so often, however even putting just ¬£50 aside each month into a savings account will help massively for when you wish to buy a car, pay for university or pay for when you decide to go on holiday with friends after you finish school and help you get a property for when you wish to move out.
7.	If you know what to do you could invest your money in stocks, I wish I‚Äôd known to do that sooner, if you can invest ¬£100 each month into shares over a few months or years your portfolio will grow and hopefully if you bought the right shares could make some sweet profit.  
8.	Carrying on from number 3. Use this time while you‚Äôre still at home to travel, I live in the UK so after we did A levels (I did engineering Btec) after saving up for about 2 years my friends and I were able to go interrailing (backpacking as the Americans call it!) through Europe for 4 weeks.  But only do this with friends that you know you can have fun with. The people I went with didn‚Äôt enjoy going out to clubs and getting drunk as much as I do, so I wish I had gone with people I could do that with.
9.	if it, it‚Äôs too good to be true it usually is 
10.	your Parents don‚Äôt always know best, if you want to follow a career path and your parents don‚Äôt agree do it, you will regret it. Thankfully I have parents that support me in whatever I do, but I know people that do.
11.	Don‚Äôt hang around people who aren‚Äôt your friends. Fake people are the worst people, people like this will uses you, manipulate you and lie to you.
12.	It is ok to have no friends, there is a difference between being alone and being lonely. Eventually you will find a small social crowds with whom you will do everything with. 
13.	As Chris Gardner once said Plan B and C are rubbish, stick to your plan A and you will succeed. 
14.	People don‚Äôt always change; some do I am completely different now than 2 years ago. But some people I was at school with are the same, they are the same dickhead who likes to be funny by putting others down, people like that are stuck in their own little world to scared to realize that they have been left behind due to still being immature. 
15.	As I said in 11 and 4 if you don‚Äôt have fun you will regret it, I promise you, one of the friends I went with told me he regrets not smoking weed in Amsterdam or getting drunk on ¬£1 beers in Budapest and wants to go again to have the experience he didn‚Äôt.  Life is fun enjoy it while you can.
16.	You will probably have that night where you go to a party or a night out in town where you‚Äôll drink too much and get beyond the point of wasted, at the time you‚Äôll feel like shit and regret it but after time for me it was a year it becomes something you and your friends laugh at especially when they tell you all the things you can‚Äôt remember. 
17.	‚ÄúIn game theory, it serves you to be two-faced. Be everyone's friend 'til the moment you're not. Make them love you so much that when they're up against you, their own loyalty will act against their own self-interests‚Äù. That's game theory. This was taken from one of my favourite TV series prison break. And I think it perfectly describes social interaction between teenagers and young adults. People will use you and you will use people even when that wasn‚Äôt your intention. I‚Äôve been used by people id call my closest friends some did it intentionally some not. 
18.	Find a hobby there is no such thing as an odd or weird hobby, it allows you to find a common interest with people allowing you to make new friends and meet people, when I turned 18 my hobby was cigars, I‚Äôd go to various cigar lounges around London and meet people obviously they were older but the best thing about a cigar is the great conversation that comes with it. That‚Äôs just my opinion.
19.	You will most likely regret the things you didn‚Äôt do not the things you did. Don‚Äôt dwell on the past and your previous mistakes focus on the present and the future. If there is someone you fancy, ask them out what‚Äôs the worst that will happen? They might say yes worst case they say no. but at least you tried. 
20.	At a nightclub or festival where your surrounded by people you don‚Äôt know, never except a drink from anyone if it wasn‚Äôt poured out Infront of you. First time I went clubbing I excepted a drink of champagne from someone I didn‚Äôt know in one of London‚Äôs busiest clubs I was lucky that it was fine. 
21.	Never shake someone‚Äôs hand sitting down and always grip firmly and make eye contact.
22.	In a negation never make the first offer.
23.	Take the time to talk to a homeless person, they sometimes have the most interesting stories and lessons to teach. Everyone falls on hard times, someone I spoke to was a veteran and ended up losing his home. 
24.	Friends come and go
25.	Never stop in the pursuit of happiness 
26.	Loneliness isn‚Äôt forever. The most popular person may also feel alone. 
27.	It might not be a good life, but it‚Äôs your life so live it.
28.	You can never please everyone, live for yourself and not others
I know this is a long post but below I‚Äôve left a summary of all the things I‚Äôve done and experienced being a teenager (2012 ‚Äì 2021)
11-12:
Started secondary school where I made new friends and experienced a whole new environment including no more packed lunches.
12-13:
Another year of secondary school, made it into the higher level classes for science and IT, at this point I started to experience bullying for the first time from the same person I was friends with the year before, I also entered my schools coding competition where we competed against the neighbouring school in who could create the best game on scratch. During this year I re-kindled a past friendship with someone from primary school whom I drifted apart from. We remain close to this day. (He won the coding competition with a moon landing game). Joined my school‚Äôs car mechanics club too.
13-14
3rd year of school, the bullying started getting worse. Applied for the bronze Duke of Edinburgh award ( for the non-brits here it‚Äôs an award scheme where the participant has to take part in volunteering, something physical a skill and finally a hiking expedition) no you don‚Äôt get to meet prince philip until you complete the gold award too. Picked my GCSE options. Had my first real crush (this was a fiasco in itself) as well as had my first kiss with someone else (another awful experience).
14-15 
Aight cool year 10, time to start my GCSE studies and think about the future. The bullying reached its peak I lost it tried to fight him failed sort of, I got a few punched in before teachers came and pulled us apart, spent the rest of that day and the whole next day internal exclusion room, him too. (was oddly fun ngl), might I add that even the headteacher was aware of the bullying and didn‚Äôt care neither did the pastoral manager who when I told her about the first time told me to go away and grow up. Completed my Silver Duke of Edinburgh award. I never completed the last level (gold).
15-16
Woo last year of high school time to sit the exams that so many people think will ruin their lives if they fail. Yes the best you do will allow you to go on and do better things like a good university or doing the A levels you want, but it won‚Äôt stop you getting the career you want, you will just need to take a different path to get there like I did. Towards the summer I was getting ready to go on Israel tour my first time away from home for more than a week and to a new country without my family. For those of you that don‚Äôt know what Israel tour is, it is when you go to the state of Israel for 3 weeks maybe more depending on the tour organiser and see various sites such as the western wall, dead sea, Masada, ride camels in the desert, live on an army base for a few days as part of a small boot camp type thing (my favourite part) and much, much more. On this though I sadly realised that some people can‚Äôt be trusted and will stab you in the back, my ‚Äúfriend‚Äù liked the same person I did and instead of saying something to me he just spoke shit about me to her. 
16-17
Secondary school, been there done that got the fucking t shirt. After not doing as well as I expected to in my GCSE exams, I had to change my plan slightly. I wanted to go into forensic science to do this I wanted to study level 3 Btec in applied science, but because I had failed 2 of my exams (the important ones) I had to do a level 2 course instead (same subject but lower level) during this year being in a new environment from the last I bought and smoked weed for the first time as well as getting my first hangover. During this year I was able to re sit my exams I passed 1 but still failed the other. I realised that the subject I was doing was no longer my passion. I got my first part time job as a receptionist so I could build my first gaming PC. My other close mate: after helping him meet his first girlfriend which by this point was at the 8- or 9-months mark, the 2 of them wanted to help me find someone. After fancying the same girl for the last 3 years at this point they introduced me to someone else, we were all away on a summer camp together so after being introduced we got talking for the next 4 whole days became really close only for on the last night before the big party for her friend to talk shit about me to her (seems to be a pattern here). A week later I had my second snog (kiss, make out, get with) with someone else (whatever u want to call it), this one was decent this happened to me on the NCS award (national citizen service) it‚Äôs like the Duke of Edinburgh award.
17-18
As I said before science was no longer what I wanted to do, so I changed to engineering at a new college (community college for the Americans). As I still didn‚Äôt have a C grade or above in my remaining GCSE exam, I had to do another level 2 course to pass. I got a new job as a waiter/kitchen assistant. started talking to another girl who in many ways she was a female version of me, we agreed on everything and got on well had so much in common it was unreal. My mate sadly broke up with his girlfriend so he was on the market too looking for someone else, I suggested to him that for his 18th he should throw a massive party, he agreed. I saw it as the perfect opportunity to make a move on the girl I was talking too; so, I invited her as my plus one. I got to his house early to help setup the house, she arrived about an hour later. I made a poor miss judgment that night and drunk about half a bottle of Russian standard vodka (no mixers). Being my drunk self I stumbled over to her and we began talking, then guess who comes over to us the same girl who cock blocked me previously and she does the god damn same, I have to admit me being as drunk as I was at That point definitely didn‚Äôt help. As you could I lost my shit at the person who yet again ruined something for me I went off on one in front of the whole goddamn party by this point the full force of my drinking hit me, I was unrollable cursing at the bitch who for the second time ruined something I had with someone. By this point the girl I invited left early, and my parents were called to pick me up. FYI the party stared at 8 I was home by 9 30 passed out. The girl I invited never spoke to me again I tried to apologise she didn‚Äôt really want much to do with me (understandable). My 18th I went clubbing for the first time and experienced a casino for the first time (played blackjack with ¬£25 walked out with ¬£120(I don‚Äôt encourage gambling, only play with what you can afford to lose)). The night club itself was something I didn‚Äôt enjoy all too much, main reason being there was only a few of us and the club was full of much older crowd than us, drinks where a fortune too, it was fun I enjoyed being out in the capital with my close mates at that time. It‚Äôs all about finding clubs that offer student nights where the crowd will be younger. Summertime, before the majority from my year head to university they all host a second school prom a reunion. This night again I learnt that people can and will be 2 faced if it serves them better. A girl who my mate had been helping me get talking to decided that the night before prom at a separate party he would make out with her himself (I was fine with that; I wasn‚Äôt at that party). I got invited to pre-drinks at this girls house the minute I walked in something felt off, it wasn‚Äôt until later I knew why; I found out my mate had made out with her the night before, unexpectedly he apologised to me (he didn‚Äôt need to, however I told him it was fine and move on)  I was still hoping to get with her. 20 minutes later Infront of me the same mate of mine and the same girl were making out again (now I was pissed, first you apologise and then 20 minutes later do it Infront of me and everyone making me look like a mug). And again he apologises I played the bigger man held myself back from sparking him in the face and said that once is a mistake, 2 times is a slap in the face) this mate of mine was coming traveling with me 3 days later we didn‚Äôt speak until then. I went interrailing (traveling) through Europe with 4 mates that summer.
18-19
What was supposed to be my first year at university turned out to be another year at community college. This was also the start of where things got bad for me, by this point all my friends have had some sexual experience except me. My social crowd at this point is dwindling slowly at the time I didn‚Äôt notice I was just being left out more, (looking back, with some of my friends I was a background friend). I was finally on level 3 Btec engineering and have finally passed my last exam that I needed (took 4 attempts but if at first you don‚Äôt succeed try, try again).
19-20 (Present)
Ok things are bad, I‚Äôve realised that only 2 of my close mates are my only friends ( I walk a lonely road, the only one that I have ever known, don‚Äôt know where it goes but its home to me, I walk alone). I knew for a while since the previous summer that most of the people I trust and call my friends don‚Äôt care about me. I only ever spoke to them If I was lucky enough to be invited out on the rare occasion (I would usually have to be the one to make the effort). I wanted to rid of the people who don‚Äôt care about me, I never thought for a second 2 of my other close mates (separate from the ones I mentioned in 19-20, they will always be my close mates) would be the ones to go first. One of these mates was someone who I had so many memorise with, we went clubbing together, wingmen for each other, I allowed him to get off with someone at my house while I was asleep in the same room (didn‚Äôt know until the morning); and now since the start of the coronavirus pandemic we haven‚Äôt spoken or seen one another and is telling people it‚Äôs my fault. (he and many others know that if I have done something to upset someone I will always be happy to fix it, I hate beefing with people) I realised he didn‚Äôt care for me no more, the memories we had together meant so much to me and nothing to him, he‚Äôs part of a new social crowd most of them I know and have also tried to get close with but I was never able to. I know I did something wrong to make all these people pull away from me I just don‚Äôt know what, I run so many possible reasons through my head but none make sense or seem big enough to make to a huge social crowd no longer want me around (popularity baffles me, it‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve never been nor able to understand).
Now in my FINAL year of college and looking at either looking at going to university to study either Aerospace or Electronics engineering, getting an apprenticeship or I may join the army or the royal air force. I kind of wish I studied law. All I really want for my self is a job I‚Äôm proud of, something that when someone asks what I do for a living I can tell them and not be embarrassed or ashamed and not have to lie or exaggerate about it. However, before coronavirus hit the UK badly, I started a new part time job in retail pays very well for what it is, and I get nice bonuses I still managed to keep it through the lockdown. Been predicted high grades for my course more than enough for my university choices and the apprenticeships schemes I want.
As I said at the beginning, this isn‚Äôt goodbye. I‚Äôll still be here offering advice where I see fit giving my wisdom to those who need it. Also, if any of you need to talk or any advice drop me a message on here and I‚Äôll try my best to help.

Henceforth I had become a wannabe redneck/hick. I followed many many instagram pages that posted about Donald trump, far right political opinions, and diesel trucks, as well as other American political pages even though I'm Canadian. Me now 4 years later am more true to myself. I have my own friends who like me for myself. I'm a weeb, I love heavy metal, I no longer dislike the lgbtq+ just because my crowd disliked them and I am not racist anymore. From I just said your probably thinking wow this kid was probably a dick. Your right lmao. But that aside, if there's one thing  this whole experience taught me, it's that nothing feels better than being yourself. I found new friends, who share my interests. So if your struggling right now because you feel like you can't be yourself, lemme tell you right now, there is someone for everyone in this world, no matter who you are or what you like, everyone can make friends in this world. Who are we to judge each other? All we can do is our best. This sub has helped me vent in the past and I've laughed and cried in it, so if you want, hit me up and start a conversation.

61,l4bjct,teenagers,Mon Jan 25 02:23:04 2021,I will take a non-biased perspective on which sex has it worse,"Firstly, we will discuss men.
Men go through a lot, people, no matter what sex, go through alot. Now let's see what men go through. They are forced to bottle down emotions which is pretty bad, (depression rates between sexes disputed so I won't touch on that) the court system heavily leans towards women, which can be very bad, a man can lose everything, and which in the same situation, a woman loses little to nothing. Men also have a few benefits, they are naturally stronger and bigger than a woman, if you put a man against a woman (average man and woman) a man will probably beat her into oblivion. So this can give men an authority complex, granted this is rare and shouldn't be a justification for hating men. 
Boys growing up also suffer problems in school, teachers are usually biased towards girls (especially if the teacher is female, if a male teacher is biased towards girls the FBI needs to be called) and the American school system is weighed more for girls to succeed, this is in Elementary school mostly. A boy once got in trouble for chewing a Pop Tart into the shape of a gun. Which is something boys are interested in. Most things boys are interested (guns, war, action, hero stories, video games) are repressed for more girl like things. Which makes things hard.

Now let's get to women, they are expected to be pretty, and are more likely to be sexually abused, and periods, oh god, periods, this shit is painful and shouldn't exist, it is the unholy spawn of Satan himself, I don't see how its possible for women to go through this shit for 10 days per month, it is painful, it shouldn't exist, it justifies why women get everything handed to them, oh god, thinking about it makes me scared.

My final verdict, men have it worse, but who cares? Men aren't people. Jk, but if any women can help expand the bad things for women list, feel free to",/r/teenagers/comments/l4bjct/i_will_take_a_nonbiased_perspective_on_which_sex/,0

Almost every boy I've talked with on here caught feelings for me sooner or later and like, I just wanna chill with guys? Talk with them? I'm not looking for a date, you know, I never really had a crush for anyone on here

But he's different than others. He's not as horny as majority here. He's not a dry texter. He's not american, surprisingly. He's not ridiculously older than I am. He's kind, caring, awesome listener and great person to talk with. For the first time in years there's someone who doesn't care about feelings much, someone I relate to.

We talked just fine, just messing around about anime, games, everyday struggles, lots of things, I thought of him as a friend, I was relaxed when I was talking with him. After he said that I'm his crush it changed. I'm getting nervous when talking to him, I play with things around me to somehow avoid? focusing just at him cause I'm worried I might ruin this.

I'm just not sure, do I like him? Or love him? Or is there a thin line between those two feelings? I can't possibly fall in love with someone I've never seen, right??",/r/teenagers/comments/l5dy6x/wtf_is_this_feeling_its_not_possible/,1

8,ko4s7r,dating_advice,Fri Jan  1 06:14:32 2021,(20M) got rejected really need advice please,"One day i was just browsing tinder and i found this girl [19] she lives in Germany and I live in the Netherlands. She had her instagram in her bio and i decided to message her because its easier then to get matched. We started talking about basic daily stuff asking how she was how her day was etc.

I found out she was heartbroken by a guy in Australia (probably a scammer) that just vanished. I made it my mission to make her feel happy again and it worked she started to cry less and she started to be happy again. At some point we started getting into eachother we called eachother pet names like honey, hun etc. and we really started to like eachother, i fell in love with her. We started sexting, sending pictures etc. and i really thought she loved me back untill one day i told her i loved her and she admited she couldnt say it back because she didnt felt the same for me. She admited she was using me for distraction mostly to not think about the Australian guy but she likes me but just doesn't loves me.

So i asked her what is she would want me to do, stay friends and keep just let it be friends with benefits or if she would want me to leave. She said she wanted me to stay. At some point we started talking about meeting up wich we eventually did I sat 6 hours in the train to her and 6 hours back. As you can expect we had sex and we cuddled and fell asleep together like real couples do. We talked about if one of us finds someone else they liked more we would stop doing what we were doing and stay friends. 

So fastforward to today. She told me she is starting to like a guy she met from her friendgroup and asked me to stop doing the sex stuff with her. Ofcourse I am heartbroken by this news but I knew this was gonna happen sooner or later. Did I my own grave by staying with her or was I right to stay with her. I truly dont know. 

it might be good to add that I am Chronicly depressed and I have PTSD and that I think about suicide alot. This girl was the first girl i trully loved and I know there are others out there but as someone that is depressed it can be hard to see this.
Right now i am struggling with my feelings and I don't know what is going to happen wich scares me the most. 

I know i wasn't the best person i could be to her but i tried my hardest to make her love me back so things would be easier. I guess some people aren't just ment to be together.",/r/dating_advice/comments/ko4s7r/20m_got_rejected_really_need_advice_please/,5
93,kouvrv,dating_advice,Sat Jan  2 11:47:12 2021,"I left town, got ghosted, months later got blocked on everything. Still can't get her out of my head. Advice please.","Hey guys, last year I was working remotely in another country where I met a fellow American. She was beautiful, nerdy, working for a non-profit and had a very calming presence. We met during a class and she ended up finding me on instagram later. We connected and planned to meet.

I was leaving the country in a couple weeks, she was aware of it, so I went into the date with no expectations. She showed up in a lovely dress and we really hit it off. I am not the kind of guy to believe in soulmates and I was having a blast as a single guy in other countries. But this woman had me shook.

We both had unique up-bringings, similar taste in music and most importantly what we wanted out of life (social work, adoption etc.) She constantly brought up sex but I always pivoted away - I didn't want her to be a nomadic hookup. She was too special to risk it.

On my last weekend we made a lot of plans. She was quite busy that week with work but she was more distant than usual. I wanted to discuss any potential for the future during a planned hike. She ended up canceling all weekend and asked me out for dinner the night before my flight. I told her I wasn't sure as I had a very busy day and I figured she just wasn't interested - if she liked me surely she would've wanted to spend the last weekend with me.

That day she messaged me for dinner but I was feeling very sad for leaving and her general lack of interest. I didn't respond. Next day as I boarded my plane I told her she was one of the most beautiful souls I've ever met and I didn't want our friendship to end. I told her I was asking her out on a date 2 months in advance when I'd be back. Silence. I never heard from her again. 

I left her a couple messages telling her I was sorry for blowing her off on my last day and I just couldn't say goodbye. Told her to stay safe during covid. No response. I didn't bother her further and planned on messaging her when I'd return to the country just in case she wasn't sure if I was serious. I messaged her friend to find out what was going on. No response. 

Over the next few months, covid blocked travel. I dated other women but kept thinking about her. I posted instagram stories that she and her friend viewed but that's it. One day after months of no contact, she blocked, unblocked and followed me again on IG. I thought nothing of it and followed her back. Still didn't want to be annoying and thought she would reach out if she wanted. A week later she blocked me on everything. 

I was incredibly confused. Other female friends said she must've liked me if she felt the need to block me after months of no contact. She was a very mature woman, I was quite surprised at why she couldn't even say she wasn't interested. Was I suppose to do something? 

I plan on being back in her town in a couple months as covid restrictions end. Will be there for remainder of the year. I am thinking about getting a friend to deliver a letter to her with some flowers. I am okay with her not being interested/available, I would love to still be friends with her if dating isn't an option. I care about her deeply and feel happy thinking she is safe and well. 

Any thoughts on her behavior? I realize I was a jerk for blowing her off on my last day but I corrected that within one day by apologizing. It's been 10 months since I heard from her and it still messes with me.",/r/dating_advice/comments/kouvrv/i_left_town_got_ghosted_months_later_got_blocked/,10
72,kpj5hn,dating_advice,Sun Jan  3 13:32:08 2021,Need some general advice on why I can't get myself a nice girl!!,"So I honestly feel I‚Äôve got the short end of the stick, I feel like nothing will ever work out for me in a romantic point of view. I feel I can‚Äôt even get a nice lady to see me on a casual basis, let alone a life long partner or even a one night stand. End goal is a partner for life, one who will love me and have my back till the end. But I see nothing wrong with meeting some nice woman for a bit of fun or having some friends that come with obvious benefits along the way till my new partner is on the scene. But no matter what I do or try it always seems to fall short, and I can‚Äôt figure out why. This will take a little explaining so grab some snacks if you need before continuing.

Will start with some background as I feel it will help you understand my situation much better towards the end. I have aspergers, so growing up my maturity level was always several years behind my physical age. Once in my young 20‚Äôs however this problem corrected itself as I dedicated time to learning how to be social. These days I‚Äôm 34 and recently divorced (more on this later), been flying free since May 2020. I‚Äôve put myself in social situations, joined groups for different activities, hit the bars on weekends, gotten into online dating and even had a few brave goes at flirting with some woman I liked while shopping or running everyday errands. This has got me a few first dates and some nice comments but that's about it (again little more later). I know socially I‚Äôm quite fine, few nights at the bar got me invited to some after parties, still in a lot of my group activities (EG D&amp;D and Zumba classes) and have been told by quite a few sources that I socially fit in and in no way come of as desperate, they got no reason to lie to me either. 

A little on the past now to help you see where I‚Äôm coming from. My first GF was when I was 18. Let‚Äôs say she only went out with me to break my values and ended up cheating on me for half of our 8 month relationship with my best friend. This shut me down for about 4 years as I retreated into video games and church life. Before that my school life wasn‚Äôt much better, always moving around and never settling in one place made it hard to keep friends, if I made any at all. Was always the social outcast at school, being a little chubby didn‚Äôt help. Dropped out of school before finishing grade 10 as I just couldn‚Äôt handle it anymore (met first GF at tafe). 

I finally left home around 25 and moved to the city, this is where I finally lost my virginity‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ to a dam escort‚Ä¶. Spent the next 6 months unable to get myself any ladies and only settling for escorts. Burned through about 6 or 7K to achieve this, not a part of my life I‚Äôm proud of. I finally met my exwife not too long after this and we pretty much skipped the dating phase, engaged within 3 months, both 28 at the time. Looking back I was desperate and she was too in a way, and I know she had some kind of love for me, not too sure now what that was, but something was there. We stayed engaged for 18 months before getting married in 2015. After we got married things started decaying at a very slow speed. She was lazy, didn‚Äôt give much affection, double standards, emotionally manipulated me and the list goes on, could do a whole post on just this marriage to be honest. The sex was one of the worst (not the most, but up there). On average once every 6 weeks to 2 months and most of the time she would open her legs, jump on her phone and give me 10 minutes to do what I needed. She never really put any effort into trying to please or pleasure me. Kisses most times had to be bargained for with chores, coffee, a massage and so on‚Ä¶ So by this point life wasn‚Äôt looking too good, but I stayed determined I could help her while fixing us, and because deep down I thought it would never get any better. I know I‚Äôm better off right now but still wonder sometimes. The catalyst for the plunge into darkness was when we lost our one and only baby. We were about 8 weeks in when we lost it, both of us being overweight didn‚Äôt really help our chances. 

This was about 2 years before I called it quits. She went into depression and started getting worse. I tried to help her however I could, we went to counselling, I tried to help her join groups to get out more, us to both lose weight and much more. She would either try for a month or so, or outright not even try at all on all these things. Always sliding back into depression. It went from depression to attention seeking but. Always posting on Facebook about how sad things are, or using depression as an excuse on me for getting out of chores, work some days, intimacy with me and the list goes on. Anytime we did things she wanted however, I cook and do the chores, holidays, go to nights out with her friends or family or anytime she got away with staying in bed all day while I did everything she suddenly wasn‚Äôt depressed. 9 months before I did leave was my first threat to leave. She picked herself up for about a month and went right back. So May this year (2020) I left. Her hanging out with some old friends, including an ex boyfriend was the straw that broke the camel's back. Saying she felt more loved there then with me, I can‚Äôt prove it but I know she cheated on me as well. 

Moved to a small country town and am currently bunking with my folks for some cheap rent and emotional support, will move out again mid next year (2021) when my work on a side project is done. I‚Äôve already lost 22kg, got heaps of work done on my side project, got a job and saved more money in 7 months then me and the ex did in 4 ¬Ω years of marriage. 

As I stated above I‚Äôm pretty good socially, still need to lose more weight but I‚Äôve come a long way and now only need 3XL shirts (down from 6 and 7XL, about 139kg right now, but will admit I don‚Äôt look half bad. So my weight will play some factor, maybe. But I‚Äôve tried with girls around my size, bigger and smaller, different ages and much more. While I‚Äôve made some nice friends out of this it seems like if I want to break my drought I will need to start seeing escorts again, which I don‚Äôt really want to do.

Now I do have one lone exception to this. About 3 months back I met a girl at one of these after parties I went to after meeting some (now) friends at a bar after I flew solo for the night (new to town). We made a date 2 weeks later and I had what I can only describe as the best night of my life as we went for 4 hours doing things I didn‚Äôt know were possible. She chased me and led most of the night, I felt so wanted and like a man for once. That was the only oasis in a desert that has been 19 months now, my ex withheld any sex for the last year of our marriage. Now this girl might be on the cards again later, not sure right now (seems this not sure things is a norm for most the girls I‚Äôve got any future chance with, so over the endless limbo). And I‚Äôm talking to a few other ladies and seeing what happens. But for the life of me I can‚Äôt seem to get past 1 or 2 dates with any nice woman, or so much as secure a friends with benefits arrangement or something more casual with others. 

Now I‚Äôd like to point out I‚Äôm no creep. I want anything, be it a relationship or something not as serious to be with consent from both sides, and I at least like to meet a woman for coffee before doing anything with her, or maybe meet at the bar before :D. Some of you might say I‚Äôm trying too hard, but I‚Äôm letting a life long partner come naturally and I have no intention of rushing into any relationship before giving it time and using the knowledge I gained from all my past failures to make sure I do it right this time. But in the meantime it shouldn‚Äôt be impossible to have something more casual on the side should it? 

Please feel free to ask whatever questions you like. I‚Äôm really looking for some advice on this matter as I either can‚Äôt pin what is wrong with me, am I just so damn unlucky or whatever else might be going on. 

Update - I want to repost this with an update as I‚Äôve figured out a lot and well this has led to more questions. 

So the weekend before Christmas I spent 4 nights in a major city in my country (Australia) and every night hit the town (was in town Thursday through to Monday). Again made friends, got to hang out with different groups but never got myself so much as a little fun for a night. I also met up with a girl from a dating app I‚Äôve been happily talking to for 2 months, we both came to this city to meetup here, let‚Äôs just say that date failed big time. More on this later. Long story short I failed again to get myself any nice lady and well‚Ä¶.. Paid an escort to get over my frustrations. 

For Christmas I joined the family in another capital city (I live in the middle of nowhere Australia), getting here was a plot out of a movie breaking down in the outback and just making it in before Christmas day. I‚Äôm typing this while still with the family, leaving back for home in a few days. Again I tried to find a friend with some benefits and so on, usual story no luck. One of these girls was an old friend who I thought I could get with as we both had a small thing for each other when I was married, but I‚Äôm a loyal soul, so nothing happened. Not married now, lol. We hung out for a day and got very flirty in a makeout session, sadly as I‚Äôm typing this I pretty much know that is all it‚Äôs going to be. Won‚Äôt say what is going on as that is personal for her, but it‚Äôs a life situation where it makes it nearly impossible for us to be together, I did try but. I feel really unlucky.

The first place award goes to another dating site girl I met. We got along great, later coming to discover we have a lot of similar likes, values and more. I really want to continue getting to know her and see if she has potential for a partner (no rushing into any relationship, no matter how good it looks). But she sat me down and told me no spark, not yet anyways. There is a chance in the future, but her life is in such chaos right now I think any guy would have got the same treatment. Now this is where I can be at fault for a few things, but without telling you this my main point won't make any sense. So we agreed to be just friends and proceeded to hang out for 3 days over New Years, both of us not having any plans. I bunked at her house while we spent time going out to see sites, watching lots of netflix, cooking and swimming together. Despite this the only thing I did with her was makeout (not much of this after the friends chat either), she is a damn fine kisser though. We also got really deep into conversation about each other‚Äôs lives and became quick and close friends. I only met her online dating about 3 days before all this went down, so really fast and close friends. 

Thanks to her I‚Äôve come to realize that while not desperate in social situations, once I catch a scent of maybe getting any form of intimacy the desperation comes right out. I spent plenty of time those 3 days still hitting on her for some fun, just as friends of course. Here is the stupid thing, she is a sex fanatic, but she want‚Äôs to change that about herself, so I‚Äôm so stupid for still hitting on her hoping for maybe some casual sex as just friends or pity sex maybe‚Ä¶.. Stupid I know. I know I need to focus on myself, getting another part time job to help with income, continue to lose more weight and finally get my side project done. But I really just want a relationship or at least a nice friend who comes with benefits. If you recall, lost virginity at 25/26 to hooker and since then only known, escorts or my lack of intimacy ex wife. I know It‚Äôs a bit silly to want this when focusing on healing myself (I thought I was over my ex, but not completely as it turns out) it is a better option. But with how unlucky/lack of experience or opportunity I‚Äôve had in this area It‚Äôs not easy to just say ‚Äúwell I‚Äôll be fine with nothing for 6 months while I get the rest of my life in order.‚Äù

With that lone exception 3 months back I now realise I did play it cool on that date, I at best expected a kiss at the end of the night but got a whole night of well, lets just say it‚Äôs a night I won‚Äôt forget. My point is no expectation, gave me no desperation. I know I‚Äôve pretty much partly already answered my own question here, which I now realise (thanks new best friend). But what can I do about the fact that for the first time in my life I‚Äôve got the chance to have some regular intercourse and find a new loving partner, but I just can‚Äôt seem to get lucky, or my desperation kills any chance. I almost feel like I won‚Äôt last 6 months, which I need to do for my long term life to get better, I mean losing more weight will greatly help my chances. 

I on one side of the coin feel stupid for letting wanting some fun consume my brain most of the time, but on the other side know intercourse is a natural and desirable part of human life. We all crave it and we all should get to experience it, why does it seem like I can‚Äôt then. I will say this but, in the situations my desperation has shown itself only once would it have made the difference in whether I got lucky or not. Most times it‚Äôs a stupid set of unlucky circumstances that my desperation only made come to the surface faster. 

I know the whole argument for just focus on yourself and life will come along and give me this on a silver platter, but I digress. It‚Äôs eating me alive inside and I‚Äôm at my wits end on how to handle this situation. I honestly feel having a semi regular partner for some fun would go a long way to letting my brain settle down as I got something to look forward to. Is my train of thought wrong? Am I just stupid? I just don't know where or what to do right now. Sorry for the long ramble, the only way I can really get it out there. Any advice would be great please. .",/r/dating_advice/comments/kpj5hn/need_some_general_advice_on_why_i_cant_get_myself/,5
66,kqk9yg,dating_advice,Tue Jan  5 00:56:57 2021,"(M30) Never really dated, moved out of parents home for independence/confidence/dating, but family will have to live with me due to issues, how hard will dating be?","Made a throwaway for this purpose since I'm kind of shy so best to keep it anonymous. I feel like my problem needs a bit of context, it isn't as simple as what I titled this post, so let me unload a little, I hope you don't mind  


Before the pandemic I moved out of my parents home. Had it all: high paying job, car, and finally my own place. That all changed when (wait for it) the pandemic struck.   


I am still employed, thankfully, but my parents' marriage didn't survive the pandemic and are getting divorced. My step father is kind of a prick, it came to light that apparently he was having an affair. This post isn't about that though, I couldn't care less about what happens to him.

So currently looking for a place for us to all move into.

""Us"" includes my mom and my siblings (one who is college-bound this year, and one who is mentally disabled).

Before I made the decision my mom kept telling me ""everything is going to be okay"", ""you're your own man now"", ""you don't need to worry about me"", but you know I had to analyze her situation carefully:

  
\- she had been unemployed for 10 years, she was a housewife and the man she married made her leave her job because he would ""take care of her"". I'm sitting here wondering how is she going to find a place. I needed references, job history, proof of income for a crappy apartment complex to even consider me, how is she going to pull it off while staying in SoCal (oh yea I live in SoCal btw, renting really sucks here)

\- she is responsible for my brother currently, how would she pull this off without any support from anyone

\- how is my sister going to focus on college if there are struggles at home. I want her to be able to find her independence and not have to depend on anyone to achieve her own happiness. (See the first bullet point)

So I weighed the options: I could be a selfish jerk and carry on with my life, or I could be there for my family because they need me. I decided to help them in the end. I love them after all. But the decision nearly drove me insane, and I think it partly has to do with my upbringing and past experiences. Let me explain.

Now for me I was always the ""nerd"" type, in the sense that I prioritized academia first over anything, a ""try-hard"" if you will, so I never really dated during my high school years. I went through a rough patch in my life post-high school, I guess you can say real life hit me like a truck, and so I didn't start college until later in life. Still not dating during these college years because I was thinking I wasn't good enough, stupid I know.   


After college I got a job, and part of that job requires me to travel to other states to visit satellite offices. During one of these trips I more or less had a fling I found on Tinder. This was in 2019. I was on Tinder for the same reasons other people are: hookups, sex, etc. Was never really into that sort of stuff during my late teens/early 20s, but then I started craving it. Probably that part of the brain that nags us to spread our genes. Always chickened out though, but I guess being in a strange place I figured ""I can be anybody I want here, nobody knows me"", so it was easier for me to go through with it.

From the perspective of someone who never really enjoyed life in their youth, the fling was loads of fun, but then it wasn't when it ended. This was my first and only fling, it had lasted maybe like 3 or 4 days I don't remember anymore.  


Anyway, I ended up feeling terrible. Its the sort of empty feeling you get when you're hungry, so you eat to fill the void, and then when you stop eating you realize it wasn't hunger that was giving you that empty feeling.  


As you can imagine it kind of fucked me up emotionally, especially since she never spoke to me again. I don't think I was mentally mature enough for this. But I think it also helped me grow up a bit from the perspective that there is more to life than just work. But I also realized that I didn't want just flings or sex, I wanted an emotional romantic connection with someone. Someone to enjoy life with, explore, see the world.

So I calculated, and executed soon after the following year: I moved out. I always wanted to be independent, but I also figure this was the best way to increase my chances at attracting potential dates. Its kind of weird, but I can sort of perceive that in American culture it is preferred to not live with your parents when you're seriously thinking about being serious with someone. Am I right about this? I feel like its an unspoken rule. My mom has always said its alright to live with your parents, but then again we are a Mexican-American family, she is from Mexico while I was born here, so I think she perceives it as okay for you to live with your parents until well into your 40s. She's old school like that.  


Well after that I moved out, got to enjoy independence for a few months, and almost got to go out on my first date, but then I didn't (found her on match, and no because pandemic). Life is beautifully disappointing and fulfilling like that I guess.  


So at the end of the day I'm stepping up to help my family out as they would do the same for me. It isn't a question of whether I should or not. In life you don't get to decide which cards you play with, you get dealt with what you're dealt, and you just have to play it out sometimes.

Nothing is forever, my mom will most likely retire after a few years, and while she may or may not need my financial help, she will be on her own somewhere.  


I do worry about the situation with my brother. Most likely he is someone who is going to be living with me from this point on. But I'm not worried about that part, I'm worried that I'll fall in love with someone, only for the whole thing to fall apart because they might want me to put my brother somewhere, or worst yet kick him out, but I know deep down in my heart I'll kick them out to the curb before I do that to my own brother. That probably will hurt I bet.

Now remember I have never dated so I am severely inexperienced. Yes I was an idiot for not having realized this before, but that's the beauty of youth, you get to do dumb shit. I don't think flings count as dating. Coupled with the fact that my mom and siblings will be living with me in the very near future. How would I approach dating in my unique situation? Is there even a chance?

Where would I even look? I don't have that many friends anymore, didn't have that many to start with, so romantic connections via mutual friendships is not really an option for me. I tried dating apps, and while it is fun, and easy for finding casual relationships, that sort of thing isn't for me.

 I want to emphasize, I do realize that relationships do not equal happiness. I am quite content with my life as it is now. But I feel like life will be more enjoyable if I shared it with someone who is just as happy, you know.  


Thanks for reading, I already feel better from unloading this in writing, please do let me know what you think I should do. I will gladly appreciate any and all advice given to me :)",/r/dating_advice/comments/kqk9yg/m30_never_really_dated_moved_out_of_parents_home/,3
73,kqm9gd,dating_advice,Tue Jan  5 02:35:50 2021,"I (19F) , Worried about not finding a relationship, feeling unattractive and unlovable","&amp;#x200B;

A little information: (Just general stuff, take or leave,) I'm a 19 year old African-American girl, pansexual, and I am currently in college. Relatively tall, slight build, and short hair, if that helps at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Lately, more than I have in high school or my freshman year of college, I feel insanely unattractive and unlovable. I see so many people around me finding relationships (platonic, sexual, romantic, etc) and I feel very left out. I have tried so many times to doll myself up, be more friendly, be more approachable, and to no avail. Budding friendships die, anybody that I am attracted to seems to fade out of my life. 

I have dated before, but unfortunately, I found out after our breakup (we only dated for a month, which was about a year ago.) that he was just with me in hopes of fulfilling his Jezebel-stereotype of black women being freaks in the sheets. Since then, I have tried to convince myself that a relationship has no bearing on my self worth, but I still feel really depressed. Some of the men that I openly expressed interest in (I was varied in terms of forwardness, but I've never straight-up asked for a number or date) rejected me due to my race, my weight, my height, or said that my sexuality was off putting. I have tried to enter LGBTQ+ dating circles, or asked my other queer friends for help, but nothing really bears fruit. I often get over-dramatized responses to try and classify me (femme, butch, top, bottom, etc) which I am uncomfortable with.

My personality, as an introspective, is fair. I am witty and quick with a joke, but have never been close to the 'class clown' I am very 'chill', at times bubbly, but most often quiet. My friends often say that I have a nurturing, mom-like aura, while still being quite down to earth and honest. At times, I do have a temper, but I usually express any anger or strong negativity by taking a step back and self-isolating for a short time, rather than lashing out.  

As is the case with many women I've spoken to about this, I tend to blame my looks. I have a sharp jawline, broad shoulders, but I am not a pound over 116, which can come off a little tomboyish. I think that this contributes to a conflict with my 'soft' personality, perhaps people find that off putting? I struggle with body dysmorphia as a result of an eating disorder I struggled with for years, but with therapy, has been under control as of late. I have been told, and do believe, that I look slightly above average without makeup and quite pretty with makeup, which I have experimented with greatly. I can look polished, fresh, or fully done up, if need be. I have been told throughout my childhood that my slight frame and Carribean high cheekbones are modeling attributes, but I still feel quite inadequate as the men in my life have described me as androgynous or non-feminine. 

Whenever I attempt to be more girly, by adjusting my wardrobe or by slightly skewing my approach to people, I am met with surface level compliments that seem to bear no real influence (""oh my goodness, you look good in a dress!"" ""A skirt for once! Nice change!"" ""Oooh, she's *pretty!"" \*(said in a patronizing way, most of the time)\**)

I may come off as people pleasing in this post, but that is not really the case. I just describe the times I have tried to adjust myself, but these attempts are actually very sparse. I don't come from wealth, so I haven't really done any complete closet overhauls or expensive cosmetics. 

Anyhow, I am in **urgent need of advice** on how to go about dating and general platonic relationship building. I do have a small circle of friends, who I love dearly as if they were family, but they go to different colleges and we rarely get together. I don't think it wrong or self-serving to want to develop new friendships and meet new people.  However, every time I try, I find myself reaching out to an indifferent individual, or alone in my apartment, with nobody to talk to (even virtually, considering the current pandemic). 

***What am I doing wrong?*** **Please give any advice you think would help, and I am totally able to answer questions, or provide a picture if this post gains traction. Thank you very much. &lt;3**",/r/dating_advice/comments/kqm9gd/i_19f_worried_about_not_finding_a_relationship/,34

72,krjvla,dating_advice,Wed Jan  6 10:33:24 2021,What just happened?!,"Hey guys,

I (34F) met a gorgeous man (34M) through Tinder who I clicked with instantly. We are both travelling on the road at the moment (van life) and we spent a week together in a row, just the two of us (24 hours a day).

We ended up hooking up the first night and the morning after, and he was tender and very sensual. The sex was intensely good for both of us (we both said so).

He told me that he liked me and how much he loved my ""vibe"".

I left the second day and he contacted me later asking if we could meet up and spend new years eve together. I said yes, and he then decided to follow me on my trip.

Weird thing was that after the initial two hookups, he would cuddle me throughout the night (both being naked) but nothing further would happen, and during the day he would hug me here and there or touch my face, but nothing much. 

We've had really deep talks and shared openly about our lives. We've spent all our time together just chilling, star gazing, swimming, yoga, cooking, or having long conversations. He'd ask me lots and lots of questions about myself and share as well. Then he'd invite me to stay in his van each night. We have so much in common and the exact same perspectives on life and society etc.

I told him that I was finding it hard to read him and to understand what he wants or what was going on. He then dropped the ""I'm not vibing more than friends"" and that he rarely sleeps with anyone and normally it takes him months of building feelings, and that whilst the sex was really good, he didn't want it to happen again. I asked if something had happened and he just said he ""decided"" he didn't want to.

He also said he doesn't know if he wants to stay in Australia (and was talking about going back to Mexico constantly when we were together).

I felt like he's led me on big time by telling me he likes me, following me around, inviting me over every night and spooning me all night etc...I don't understand it. 

I left the next morning and he asked for two hugs and told me he'd be ""open to"" keeping in touch. 

Not his fault that the feelings aren't there for him but am I crazy to have assumed there was something there by the way he was acting with me? 

Oof, the rejection sucks but not knowing why is the hard part!",/r/dating_advice/comments/krjvla/what_just_happened/,7
39,kuwtnp,dating_advice,Mon Jan 11 08:13:36 2021,I'm (31/M) having a hard time building an emotional connection with dates?,"I am a 31 year old male in a major North American city. Good job, money, have plenty of interesting hobbies (salsa dancing, muay thai, yoga, weightlifting, hunting), well traveled, and consistent with reading, listening to podcasts, and always educating myself. 

In my early 20's I realized that you could just cold approach women which gave me the confidence to just talk to anyone which then furthered my confidence in my personal life and career. I started to date like crazy, slept around a lot, and even fell in love several times with amazing girls.

I am now 31 and recently Ive noticed that whenever I go on first dates, I often receive a ""Sorry I just dont feel an emotional connection"" text after or when I ask for a second. Now on the dates Im smiling, cracking jokes, being flirty, pyhsically escalate and avoid any negative topics. In recent years my hair has begun to recede and my looks have definitely changed. Though I definitely think this is a factor I dont think its mainly that because Im clearly getting initial dates with girls. In the Summer of 2020 I must of been on 15 dates and only 1 led to sex.  In October I started seeing a girl for 2 months and before Christmas she called me up and said ""I think we should stop seeing each other. I just dont feel an emotional connection."" Honestly, I was pretty relieved.

In 2019 a relationship of 1.5 years did end due to long distance with a girl I was crazy about. When that ended I started to feel cynical towards relationships as I felt ""Whats the point? It can just end"". Maybe this vibe Im still projecting. Any advice would be appreciated?",/r/dating_advice/comments/kuwtnp/im_31m_having_a_hard_time_building_an_emotional/,21
53,kv34t8,dating_advice,Mon Jan 11 15:58:34 2021,confused on who to choose,"Hi! This is my first post but I'm having trouble I need to make a choice on who to give a chance too but I am really not sure and i just really need to rant but feel free to give me suggestions.

so first off theres my ex who I still love but im not sure I should give another chance too. we are eachothers first loves first person we ever had sex with (both of us) but we broke up dec 2019 because he wanted to ""explore the world"" (be a hoe). throught 2020 tho he got with another girl, he kept coming back to me saying ""i am the only one for him"". he broke up with her and found some other people who are new. he came back to me again about saying how he loves me and wished he never broke it off and all that other stuff, he told me all the people he messed with and I didnt say anything even though it hurt cause we weren't together. plus he was actually serious about getting back together with me but I had had sex with. I knew this guy before through my ex i didnt think they were actually close he had alot of friends that were older than us and I always had a bit of a crush. when  i told him this he exploded and acted like i killed his dogbecause ""thats his friend i slept with"" but we weren't together why is that such a big deal!!!! so we ended up stop  talking once again hes still talking to other people but hes back at me again. this time he told me he slept with my ex best friend (we stopped talking cause i was sure she liked him my boyfriend at the time) and that hurt alot. he even said he did it because an eye for an eye, since i slept with his friend he did it cause he knew it would hurt me like it hurt him. BTW WE LIVE IN A SUPER SMALL COUNTRY WHERE EVERYONE KNOWS EVERYONE. also my ex has changed into this narcissistic fuck boy. we still get on super well and are very comfortable around eachother but i dont like it.

what my ex doesnt know is i slept with his other friend the one he looks up to as a mentor before he even told me about his revenge. i didnt plan for that to happen we were genuinely just friends, hes a bit older than i am but is a super nice guy and it just kinda happend. we talk every night hes really sweet to me and my friends are convinced he really likes me but I just dont think it can work. If my ex were to find out he'd hate the both of us, as i said before everyone knows everyone and i am actually friends with mentor's ex gf who still has feelings for him and i dont want to be labled as a bad person with these people. he's a really respectable guy and i dont want to put him in this situation either. plus i am not even attracted to him. i dont really like his face he has a bird chest and has super bad allergies I am really just attracted to his personality. plus i doubt he would want something serious from me so i stopped sleeping with him i am honestly dodging him at this point but he is also the best candidate right now. also i hate kissing him lol.

okay finally theres this new guy who i've had a crush on for so long. literally so cute but he is a local youtuber everyone knows him which is kinda iffy (cos everyone knows everyone). hes never been in a comitted relationship before red flag, hes a known fuck boy and he has rape allegations. sigh. it is like he is finally oticing and wants to take me out on a date but i am not sure if i wanna go. plus we have barely texted because he is so busy and texts dry do i dont really enjoy texting him back. hes a hype boy out here, very popular with what we call the ""uptowns"" loaded with money and all of that so i am kinda iffy with this. plus he goes to college in america! I said no new bodies for 2021 and i think thats all he wants idk maybe my great personality will change his mind but boys will be boys. i am clearly attracted to toxicity wow. do i take the leap of faith and go out with him or just ignore it? also all of these ppl know eachother, perks of living on a small island -\_-. 

so yeah thats basically it do i try my ex again? his friend? or the youtuber? wow this is really sad.",/r/dating_advice/comments/kv34t8/confused_on_who_to_choose/,4
98,kvkes6,dating_advice,Tue Jan 12 06:33:11 2021,Is what I'm looking for in a partner unreasonable?,"I've been reading a bunch of relationship advice for women, and have started to think that maybe what I'm looking for in a partner is toxic, but I'm not sure.  Please let me know!

I'll preface this by saying that if 999/1000 women would be unhappy and unfulfilled in a relationship with me, I view that as 'not unreasonable' standards, because I only need to find that one girl, that one time.

What I offer: I work a low-stress job and can easily cover groceries for two + all my bills with some leftover for savings.  I'd like to think that I'm decently attractive ('hwp', 'tall', etc), and that I'm not selfish in bed (sex should be satisfying for everyone, and while it can be fun to treat it like sport and do all sorts of kinky stuff, sometimes it's nice to just hug someone).  I hired a maid to handle chores once a week (clean, laundry, etc).  My house isn't the nicest but it's big enough and nothing is broken, I don't drink or do drugs (not even weed, I'm not morally opposed to substance use, but it isn't a part of my life and I don't want it to be), and I don't have (or want) any expensive hobbies (I like reading books, listening to music, sometimes watching movies/anime, working out sometimes in my home gym, and playing indie games, I feel rich when I buy a bunch of $5 games during a Steam sale).  Sometimes I'll rant about whatever weird stuff I'm reading to whoever is in earshot, and I've tried a few weird diets (keto!  bodybuilder IIFYM!  carnivore!  never vegan tho, yikes).  Not planning to have kids, kind of fucks up the finances.  Also not a fan of pets (travel is hard enough).  I don't have any mental health issues that require treatment or drugs, but I think I'm about as weird and crazy as anyone else.

What I want: I don't like doing chores at all (laundry, taking out trash, cleaning, etc), I like eating food but not cooking it, I like having a clean house but not cleaning, and I like having a pretty girl around to hug and talk to and stuff.  I don't think my standards for pretty are too crazy. If (pre-covid) I walked around any major American city for a day, I definitely saw 'a lot' of women who make me think 'wow she's cute!'; I think that as long as someone takes care of themselves (healthy food, enough exercise) and wants to be pretty, they usually can be.

So an ideal relationship for me would be with an attractive (to me!) woman who has a home-based profession that isn't too stressful (so she has some disposable income for herself and doesn't feel dependent on me, but has plenty of time for 'us' rather than some manager), healthy relationships with family/friends (I'm a homebody and really hate the idea of someone being totally emotionally dependent on me, people who try to emotionally isolate people are weird and a little scary), who likes managing a household (I don't actually care who does chores, as long as it isn't me)/cooking for two, is kind of a homebody, doesn't care too much about signifiers of social status (owning brands, going out so people can see you wearing brands...there's nothing wrong with spending all your time around the house in PJs!), doesn't have any serious mental health or substance abuse challenges, and likes physical affection.  I think FDS would derisively call a woman who agrees to this a 'bangmaid' (yikes).

20,kvygty,dating_advice,Tue Jan 12 21:17:12 2021,Sex with tinder match,"I‚Äôm (23M ) black guy from the Midlands, recently I have matched with this white girl on Tinder, didn‚Äôt think too much of it, but her on the other hand different story.

I‚Äôm one of the lucky few people, not to have been affected by lockdown, career wise. I have a steady income working in a place I like, while 
I also have a side job in the sports industry, I hope to eventually progress with my side job, and make it my main source of income, hopefully working abroad such as America or Canada.

However, due to this lockdown and being single, I haven‚Äôt had much fun in the bedroom department recently, When it comes to one night stands I don‚Äôt believe guys should be pick, better have sex with a girl you don‚Äôt find attractive then lust after the girl of your dreams for years only for her to end up with someone else. 

I recently matched with this girl on Pinder, let‚Äôs call her Emma. We have been messaging each other,  things were cool at first, but then she started obsessing with the fact that I‚Äôm black which started creeping me out, she kept telling me how she liked black guys. 

 I asked her what her favourite TV show was, she told me she liked power, because ‚Äúit‚Äôs full of black people‚Äú like wtf kinda of reason is that to watch a show. Nothing about the story or the drama  of the show, just the ethnicity of its actors. 

At one point she told me she had a one night stand with a black guy, and she got pregnant from it,I‚Äôm not sure I really believe her but whatever. However what she said next was what made me decided I wanted to cut her off, she said she was so happy she was pregnant because she always wanted a mixed child, she didn‚Äôt even know much about the father, she was just happy at the fact she had gotten pregnant by a black man, if her being pregnant is even true, so take it with a pinch of salt. 
 
We arranged for her to spend a couple of nights at mine, here is the problem, I don‚Äôt know if I should just have sex with her and then break things off with her, or maybe just tell her we‚Äôre better off as friends(I don‚Äôt want her as a friend, just being nice). Then again like I said before, it‚Äôs been a couple of months since I‚Äôve had some fun lol.

Any suggestions on how I should handle this.",/r/dating_advice/comments/kvygty/sex_with_tinder_match/,57
44,kxf1zy,dating_advice,Thu Jan 14 23:19:32 2021,Is he a normal American guy or a psycho?,"After the break up the first guy that I liked seems to be strange. 

He's from the US and he's working in one of our branches. I was introduced to him when with some colleagues we went on a business trip. And from the first day, after the drinks,z he started hitting on me. 

Nothing happened during the first trip, as when he was hugging me, I just left him there saying goodbye. But he showed some tiny attention, like when he was smoking outside and I joined him, he lit a cigarette, though he never smokes more than one. Or he found out my eating habits, though I never told him. Or when I wrote in our group chat that I'm going upstairs he joined me after 2 minutes. 

But when we are alone together he acts like he doesn't care about me, he doesn't talk to me, etc. When we returned to the city he told me where I can find him, I went there with friends and we met, and we started discussing some topics and my friends left us alone in the bar. After some time he started to hug me and after a couple of minutes, he just left. 

And recently I was invited to a friend's party. And he wrote to me that he wants to come. My friend invited him. At first, he entered and didn't pay that much attention, but after some time he started hugging me, telling me some sweet nothings, and kissing in front of my friends. So we left the party together, though he didn't say bye to anyone and was waiting for me outside of the club. 

Sex was good, though it was so odd because he skipped the foreplay. And that was so odd to me. Btw I enjoyed it when he started hugging me at the club, but when he started kissing me I felt nothing. 

We had another business trip - now we were alone with the driver. He sat in the front seat, leaving me in the back alone. And then he didn't say anything, I was talking with the driver, while he was checking his email, Facebook, dating apps, etc. I think he wanted me to see that he's using dating apps, but I already knew that. So we returned from the trip and we barely talked for 15 mins. When we were back the driver and I was discussing how hungry are we and where and what we want to eat. After some time he stopped the car, said he's hungry, and went to a restaurant. And 50+ driver and I had dinner without him.

I just can't understand what is going on with him. Is he nuts? I know he has anxiety, is his behavior has anything to do with it? He shows attention and talks to me actively only when he's drunk. Does it mean he has just a lack of experience or he's just drunk, and everyone is gorgeous when he's drunk?

I really can't understand and don't know how to react. Is he a normal American guy or a psycho? What should I do?",/r/dating_advice/comments/kxf1zy/is_he_a_normal_american_guy_or_a_psycho/,20

46,l0rrlo,dating_advice,Tue Jan 19 21:57:08 2021,Dating Post-Religion,"I get that getting compliments on dating sites aren't anything substantive but it has helped heal me. I grew up in a really conservative religion. And my two narcissisist parents figured out that dropping us off at the place of worship for activities and leaving us there for hours is a great way to get free babysitting services and spend less time with their kids. Anyway, it distorted my whole world view because of the crazy ass gender norms. Men were expected to pretend that women didn't exist, not look at women, random guys would direct me to enter in through another door. Alot of bs and hypocracy because I'm sure they were watching porn at home...but I digress. I grew up having no clue how attractive I was. Not just physically but my personality and my spirit. I realize now it was a combo of the narc parents in addition to having to spend so much time in a toxic religious and cultural community and also the constant barrage of racism and negativity of being a vilified minority in America has really distorted how I view myself. Even if chatting with other singles on dating sites, phone calls, and video dates is just the beginnings of something and not necessarily lead to dates or a relationship it has helped dissolve my distorted self image.",/r/dating_advice/comments/l0rrlo/dating_postreligion/,9

58,l3hw7w,dating_advice,Sat Jan 23 20:54:49 2021,Distance... the DREADED distance,"So I‚Äôve been with my boyfriend for over a year. He‚Äôs Brazilian and I‚Äôm American. I‚Äôve spent about 6 months there in total, 3 of those months being simultaneous. We get along perfectly. He‚Äôs wonderful. I love him and I want to marry him. I know he‚Äôs my soulmate. We have matching scars for matching reasons, he shares my mums bday exactly 20 years later, we randomly met while I was on vacation and he was deployed with navy in the same place where my ex boyfriend was from. Coincidences. 

So fast forward. He has a dream to be navy seal in Brazil. He has a contract for 3.5 more years in the navy, or he has to pay to break it. He always intended before he met me to do the navy seal course, it‚Äôs his dream literally. The man spends his free time watching YouTube videos about it. So anyway, we always have unprotected sex. We never had any close calls, although we deserved it admittedly. Well now I‚Äôm pregnant. 

He will starts his course when I‚Äôm 3 months pregnant. This course involves him being gone for weeks at a time, without his phone. He won‚Äôt even be talking to me. He offers to give up, he offered to give up before I was even pregnant just to be with me. I just don‚Äôt have it in my heart to say yes, again... it‚Äôs his dream. So basically he will go through the course, I will have the baby 3 months before he finishes. I told him he needs to be here by the time the baby is 6 months old. I‚Äôm a first time mum and I‚Äôm scared. I need him. I don‚Äôt want to do it alone. But then I‚Äôm like.. why do I need to do anything alone if he‚Äôs literally only gonna be a navy seal for 3 months, why doesn‚Äôt he just come now?

Opinions please!

Side note: moving to Brazil isn‚Äôt an option. I‚Äôve been there enough times to know it‚Äôs not an option. Also, he would never be home anyway, so what‚Äôs the point? And if I leave now, I would have to come back and try to find a job after many years of not working while I have a toddler! It‚Äôs not realistic. I can‚Äôt do that with faith. Not to mention Brazil is dangerous, I can‚Äôt speak the language, I have no friends there, my partner would be gone (like literally gone!), I have no family there... how selfish am I to say he needs to come before the baby is born? He would have to give up his dream he‚Äôs worked toward for 8 years!",/r/dating_advice/comments/l3hw7w/distance_the_dreaded_distance/,2
17,kosjkk,ask,Sat Jan  2 08:31:46 2021,Is it bad to only think about your dreams and ambitions?,"I (24M) only think about my dreams and ambitions. It literally consumes my thoughts. I'm so hungry to achieve my goals. My goal is to get my master's in Psychology of Sport and then work for Formula 1 or division 1 football/soccer. I finished my bachelor's and I've worked in business ultimately I didn't like it. I got very fortunate and got a job working in mental health with patients with severe mental illnesses (Schizophrenia, Bipolar, etc.) the job was a high turnover rate job. It's been two years from when I got my bachelor's. After finding sports psychology I've been obsessed to make it. 

My problem is that it's literally what I think about everyday. It makes me depressed and frustrated I can't start already. I've already been accepted to a degree in England and I have headed abroad from America. In theory, I should have my degree in December 2021. I'm extremely ready.

I don't think about women, I don't eat, I can't sleep, I just sit watching Formula 1 or football. Studying athletes and preparing myself for my career. I go out and play football because that's the only thing I enjoy lol. I understand that sex, partying, money, etc. will come after. I don't even like partying but you know what I mean lol. My future literally consumes me and I itching to start already. 

So my question is, is it healthy to only think about my goal to the point that it makes me sad I can't start now? I don't eat or sleep I only fantasize.",/r/ask/comments/kosjkk/is_it_bad_to_only_think_about_your_dreams_and/,11
