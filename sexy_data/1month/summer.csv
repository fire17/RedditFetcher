78,obhvr2,teenagers,Thu Jul  1 12:09:29 2021,I don’t know what to do. I’m just so mad and confused,"So my cat is an indoor-outdoor cat, she goes in and out of the house pretty regularly but she hasn’t been home in the last 3 days, I mean she’s done that once before but I’m really worried about her since we just had two 110°F days in a row and yesterday was 80°, and today marking the 4th day was about 75° so it’s been pretty hot and she hasn’t stopped by to get a drink of water and cool down. I’ve checked all of her usual hunting grounds and even checked up in the trees. She is a very capable cat and I’m sure either someone took her in for a few nights or she ventured out a little far and is just being ornery. I am worried though that something did get her and I can’t help but think the worst even though I’m trying to be positive. I just can’t help thinking she died outside alone, scared, and in pain. I haven’t seen a body or smelt any foul odors coming from the yard though and I have seen a pile of feathers (a bird she would have killed) which is where most of my hood is coming from. The part that makes me mad though isn’t the fact that she’s not back it’s the consequences and discussions we are having because she hasn’t shown up yet. My little sister (9) on the first day she didn’t come home said “if the cats dead can I get a hamster” which really pissed me off and I yelled at her then and there telling her that’s disrespectful and rude in front of our parents. My dad is just like me being hopeful that she will show up but I can tell it’s just a cover and he doesn’t believe 1/2 of what he says and is only pretending to be hopeful just to make me happy but I don’t care because I prefer that over the alternative. My mom is just like my sister, just tonight she said “something probably got her, but don’t worry we will get another cat, but it will never be as good as yours” which also pissed me off because she hasn’t even been gone for a month, why is she taking about getting another animal. When I was my little sisters age about 9, I had an American bull dog that passed away from health issues and what not and I started talking about wanting another dog about a week after her passing and I got yelled at by both parents about how it’s disrespectful to talk about getting another pet so soon. And I scolded my parents when my sister said what she said because they didn’t have the same discussion with her as they did me. They then got mad at me saying “she’s too young, she won’t understand” which really ticked me off because I got that discussion when I was her age what’s the difference between me and her. All evidence I have shows that my cat is still alive and we are going to my local vet tomorrow to see if any strays that look like my cat have been brought in. But my cat is very intelligent, very predatory, and is a bad ass cat so if there’s any cat that can take down other predators twice her size it’s her. She will make it back home and I will refuse to believe something killed her until I have cold hard evidence in front of me. Sorry for the long rant but this is very stressful and angering for me and I don’t have anyone else to talk about this with without making them mad and upset. I will keep everyone updated for the next week on the status of my cat but after that I think all hope is lost.",/r/teenagers/comments/obhvr2/i_dont_know_what_to_do_im_just_so_mad_and_confused/,0

63,oevu5c,teenagers,Tue Jul  6 17:17:47 2021,"Don’t let your parents make you think that material possessions equal good mental state (most of the time, I know there are exceptions)","Disclaimer: I am on mobile since my parents took my pc away for being late to swim practice (what the fuck kinda punishment is that??), so excuse formatting pls thx.

I fell in to this trap from day one, and it was okay until I was about 13 years old. The point when you start maturing is when you realize how much the title actually means, and I was very late to the party. I asked my parents for things since I even knew that I could. I admit, I was a pretty awful kid. I was always asking for things (rarely got them) and was never very thankful when I did get them. This put me in bad standings with them that I never realized. So when my time came that I found the glory of the personal gaming computer over a console, I immediately started thinking about getting one. It would be a whole ass year of research before I was even close to getting even a slightly powerful pc. Once I did it was all downhill from there, out of nowhere my mom started beating my sister for small problems and I got the side effects of that. I started using my pc more and more to escape my family and try to get my emotions in check. It didn’t work at all. My mom started getting abusive towards me whenever I tried to escape them. I started getting in discord calls with my friends even more than I already did,resulting in my mom starting to call them racial slurs because of them being from India and Nepal and me being a completely white male in America. They would criticize every single thing they did for no reason whatsoever. After all of the racism towards my friends, they would repeatedly get pissed at me for even being related to them, which would in turn get me pissed at my parents. However these friends would have extreme respect for their parents since they were spoiled like crazy. So whenever I complained about my parents they would get mad at me for complaining since I was “spoiled.” Then once one who was kind of the leader of the group got u and left me, all the others left as well. At that point i was stuck with two friends who I couldn’t play games with, couldn’t meet in person, and could barely talk to at all anyways since I never had any free time away from my parents. The next four months of my life would be an absolute shit show since I was stuck with nothing to do and no one to talk to. Then, finally! The leader of said group of friends was finally into talks to play a couple games together again! Everything was starting to look up again and I thought I might finally have something to do. Yeah then he fucken backstabbed me and I was stuck alone again -__- Then we get to present day finally, my mom being extremely abusive and me just occasionally being late to swim practice. All I did was be late to today’s practice since my alarm didn’t go off for some reason and now I’m stuck without power in my room for the next week and not being allowed out of the house or in a room with locking doors. Life sucks.

TLDR: Title, don’t get too attached to possessions unless it actually helps you to find something you like or friends you like. I know from experience its awful if combined with shitty parents.

87,oj4ivs,teenagers,Tue Jul 13 03:43:47 2021,I feel like I am messing my life up,"So once again it’s 2 am and I’m in my rant mode. 

Lemme summarize my life so that all of this is more understandable:

In primary school I was one of those gifted children who never studied for anything and always got the best marks. It was probably the best part of my life (yeah I know, I peeked in elementary school). I even got overconfident because everybody praised me for my intelligence. 

So due to my good grades and stuff I got into a pretty challenging middle school. If you haven’t realized it by now, that’s when everything went downhill really fast. My grades started having constant seizures (I got an A on one test and a D on the next one). My GPA starting travelling to the center of the earth. I don’t know how exactly the school system works in America, but here when you fail one of your classes, you have to repeat the whole school year. Fortunately for me that had never happened to me however there were many occasions were things got pretty close. Subjects like Latin kicked my ass however somehow I managed to pass with B being my average grade. 

Anyways that sound like a semi-happy ending right? Oh fuck no because I’m in high school now. I just got through my freshman year and I literally almost got an F on six subjects. I ultimately managed to correct all of them, but that’s still pretty atrocious. About a third of my class failed and has to repeat this year and honestly I feel really bad. Some of them actually put in a lot of effort and still didn’t manage to pass while I’m just here doing absolutely nothing. 

The other thing is that all of my friends are like extremely successful. They’re winning competitions and shit while I’m just here doing absolutely nothing with my life. I’m scared that I am wasting the time where I’m actually able to learn so much on watching youtube. I always want to learn so many things but the only times my brain actually is ready to learn something is after midnight. 

Honestly, I'm messing my whole life up",/r/teenagers/comments/oj4ivs/i_feel_like_i_am_messing_my_life_up/,9

8,okmfzi,teenagers,Thu Jul 15 08:43:28 2021,I fucking hate how I can't even talk about China without someone holding me personally accountable for all the horrible things the Chinese government is doing.,"Let me preface this by saying I DO NOT support the Uighur genocide in ANY way and I think Hong Kong should be independent because I know some little edgelord is going to accuse me of being a Chinese propagandist.

I was telling some people about how I thought that China had a better pandemic response than America, and immediately like six different people started asking me shit like ""oh you support the Chinese government genociding Uighurs then???"" ""Oh so you don't want freedom for Hong Kong???"" ""Wow you're just gonna gloss over [insert horrible thing the Chinese government is doing here]???"" 

The thing is this happens EVERY time I even try to insinuate that China did something better than America. Like when I mentioned that I thought Americans tend to have a much lower opinion of China than I do and got the same response. Or when I said Chinese education teaches students more things. Or even when I said I liked Chinese food better than American. 

Or even when I correct someone's misconception about China. ""No, the one-child policy doesn't mean that the government gets to execute one of your family members if a second child is born. It just means you have to pay a fine."" ""Well isn't someone just a good little Chinese propagandist?"" Like wtf no I just don't want this misinformation spreading around.

If I tell people I don't want to talk about it I get shit for enabling it, as if my born-and-raised-American ass can do anything about it. I don't have a direct phone line to the Chinese government and even if I did, you think they'd listen to a random teenager? Tf

Or if I continue the conversation and agree that yes, I think genocide is bad, but I don't hate China with a burning fucking passion and am not ashamed of being Chinese, somehow people ALWAYS twist it into I'm advocating for genocide.


And... why the fuck can't I just have some topics I don't want to talk about? Genocide is depressing and it's fucking exhausting when it's all people want to talk about just because I'm Chinese. If I went around asking people about the Holocaust every time they mentioned something vaguely German, I'd be a huge dick, but it's okay when someone else does it to me since I'm Chinese?

What the fuck is this? Can I not talk about my culture without a barrage of people telling me I should be ashamed of myself and my heritage or else I'm supporting genocide? I can't even tell people that I think Chinese grammar is more intuitive than English without at least one person accusing me of genocide at this point. I'm so sick and tired of having to defend myself against all of these accusations just because some people who happen to look like me are being assholes in the worst possible way.

WE will be the ones living through the new age they call ""the fourth industrial revolution"" - a technological boom/growth so advanced and so rapid NEVER before seen in human history.... it's terrifying, I know. We're barely 20 years into this new chapter of history and it's up to us to chart the uncertain future. 

Just look at how far the internet has evolved - what used to be the wild west has slowly, over time, evolved into a large digital landscape full of ""cities"", communities, strange back alleys, secrets, memes and factions. 

I understand the dissatisfaction with the real world. Travelling anywhere is a pain in the ass, America's infrastructure is collapsing, political discourse is at a critical point and to top it all off there's a pandemic that just doesnt seem to end. So why interface with reality when you can travel anywhere and everywhere on the internet. 

Hot women? Cute femboys? Check!
Funny vloggers, streamers and influencers? Check! Strangers from all over the world who can relate to your pain? Check! 
A growing, empathetic LGBT community? Check!
Memes, history videos, fan art, surrealist content galore! The internet has it all!

Everything except physical intimacy... but why bother when it's so much easier to communicate online. Behind an avatar where you don't have to think off your feet to have a conservation. Where your looks and your behaviorism and your tone of voice dont have to get in the way of interacting with others...

And there then comes the split between the online you and the real you. The funny persona on reddit versus the deeply hurt quiet kid in the back... 

I cant tell you how often I look up from my screen and the real world looks foggy. The textures feel bland. And if I'm not looking at the screen for too long, then comes the FOMO...

So how do we integrate ourselves back into the real world - how can we look at reality again with fresh eyes,  a fresh perspective? Idk guys, it's a struggle....  but I'm right here with all of you trying to figure this BS out because at the core of this mess we call existence, there is always an ecstatic truth worth fighting for and I hope one day we can all find it.

They instantly believe her and fire the male 90% of the time, the other 10% is toxic in the opposite way though, with an atmosphere of sexual harrassment.

Female fakes defensive/abusive injuries on herself and calls the police? BAM, instantly the dude is arrested, no matter what the guy or other witnesses say. Even if only the male has injuries and he's the one who called the cops 90% of the time they're both getting arrested or just him.

40,osro10,teenagers,Tue Jul 27 20:50:04 2021,i honestly want to vent,"( MAJOR cw for bsfw topics, child p0rn and possible gr0mming )

ive never told this to anyone in my life, but i think getting it out there may help (therapy is expensive, venting on reddit is free).

this all happened when i was around the age of 9-11, in other words VERY young. i watched youtube videos of people going on omegle, and just seeing what would happen. i wanted to copy them, one thing led to another and soon enough i was doing extremely explicit shit for men old enough to be my dad. doesnt help that i hit puberty in 3rd grade, so i definitely didnt look my age back then (you dont see many 10 year olds with c-cups)

i remember one incident that happened. some fat guy in a sailor moon costume had asked me to record him drinking his own cum, hoping that this would get him viral. another guy asked to see my feet. 

i remember another incident. i was really into overwatch at the time, and i was drawing a headshot of tracer (it was actually kinda good, but i threw it in the garbage about a year ago). i was on omegle while i was drawing the headshot, and soon there was a guy that asked to see me without a shirt. for some reason i was wearing a bra (idk why, it was like midnight when this happened), so i took it off. i quickly left after that because i was hella creeped out (as if doing all that shit i did before this wasnt creepy enough), and eventually i landed on the same guy. turns out he WAS RECORDING ME WHEN I TOOK OFF MY SHIRT. that motherfucker was using it was blackmail. i still hope that guy has a very painful death. thats all he deserves, as well as the other pedophiles i interacted with. i couldnt give a shit if thats harsh, those assholes gave me trauma. 

the interaction that started all of this was probably when i met an australian guy on omegle. he had just gotten done surfing and his black hair was wet, i think he was white? not sure. anyway, we talked around for a few minutes, i showed him my boobs and i think after that he showed me his dick. don’t remember much after that. this incident was probably the one that started my underage-camgirl faze. luckily around 5th grade i stopped doing that shit. 

tl;dr, please please PLEASE dont share your nude body online, especially if your a minor. i was hella impressionable and easy to manipulate back then. if anyone tries to see your privates, always say no, even if they get mad. dont back down.",/r/teenagers/comments/osro10/i_honestly_want_to_vent/,6

Good Morning ladies and gentlemen, boys and motherfucking girls, this is your captain with no name speaking and I'm here to rock your world

Okay, firstly, this isn't strictly American people I just wanna point out she's American because it might help give context? Sorry if I come off as racist.

She's your average twitter girl that you see and just laugh at because of all the stupid shit she tweets (Also lesbian, all for that no racism, which she sucks at, hate all men, etc, that type of stuff)

So we were in a call and everyone in the call was straight except her, and she called us homophobic for being straight, I'm not homophobic but people like this are the reason why I don't really wanna be with gay people, don't get me wrong, I have gay, lesbian, and bi friends, it's nice to be around them, they're nice.

Another thing is that she kept saying how all men are trash, like, can she even hear herself? What she's saying is blatantly sexist, and she goes like ""it's only sexist if it's toward girls"", Not all men are like this, and let's face the truth, most guys aren't even as bad as her. It really pisses me off how people generalize this, most of the time it's just teenage girls who've experienced one breakup, I can understand if you've been raped, mistreated, abused but if you're going to hate men just because someone told you to? That's low and pathetic. This applies to everything really, not just men.

Third is she was having trouble with her valorant (She called Valorant homophobic, she's so stupid it's hilarious) and we told her to search youtube for help and not asking us about it because we also don't know what to do, then she says she doesn't want that because that's going to support white people, and she's not racist. Excuse me? That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard, racism is basically hating on one or more races. And she says she's not racist....heh.. so dumb

4th thing I really hate is I was trying to help her with her val problem because she's too ""non racist"" and she wasn't appreciating that and she went ""if you're heterosexual, you're going to hell, also if you oppose or object that, you're also going to hell"", also a generic and stupid remark people like her make.

Last but not least, she told me, ""try opposing me and I'll go to twitter and cancel you, I'll call Trisha Paytas on your ass and make her do a talk show on your ass"" 
What are you going to cancel me for? I'm the one in the right, and you're clearly the offensive one here.

Then her dad is just the ''white clean dude, the perfect father"" that help the zebra, oh cute...) but them he discuss the death of Ellie with marlene like he doesnt have a daughter of the same age?

And the worst of all, is that every time I had a flashback with Joel, more and more i hated abby, because Joel was trying to be a better father for ellie and his decisions in the end of the first game, made him feel guilty and guilty make you feel softy inside, trying to be a better person.

And then abby shot the asian dude that discovered he was to be a dad, she shoots tommy, almost kill a pregnant woman. WTF made this character?

29,obmz66,dating_advice,Thu Jul  1 17:27:50 2021,I’m beginning to feel like the importance of looks has been understated all of my dating life.,"
I’m 21 and I’ve had no success in relationships or dating. This isn’t to make a pity post. This also isn’t to complain about the fairer sex, it’s just something I want to know if other guys have noticed. I feel like since I was a kid, the importance of my appearance in every aspect of life but most importantly for this post, in dating has been severely understated.

I have always been the ugly fat one, like if I was in a boy band I’d be that one token ugly guy that everyone’s like “Why is he there?” I’ve tried to not let it bother me too much but bullying was RELENTLESS. Honestly I didn’t get a break from it until college and I still caught shit for it until 2020 and I started wearing a mask and hiding from people.

Despite this I didn’t worry about dating too much from messages given to me by my family, friends, and America’s favorite babysitter TV. They always told me that the ugly nerd gets the girl because it’s all about personality and that if I work on myself the good will attract girls. Like look at any romcom from the 2010s. It’s all underdogs getting the girl because of their personality. 

I spent high school and early college working on myself. I took academics very seriously and did so well that I got awarded a full ride to my college where I still make the deans list consistently, lost the weight and got into pretty decent shape, I did a lot of extracurriculars and learned how to play the piano, I also volunteered and did community service as much as I could, I even taught myself how to cook when my parents refused to because I’m an guy.

I’ve always been told that I have qualities women love. I’ve been told by friends that I’m funny, intelligent, hardworking, compassionate and fun to be around and I don’t think they were just blowing smoke up my ass. I haven’t had a problem making friends with girls, but I just can’t even get a first date. When I go on dating apps I get no matches.

I think I rightfully feel like my biggest obstacle is the way I look. At this point I’m not sure what else it could be. The most unattractive features are things I can’t change and when I look in the mirror I just feel hopeless. The constant rejection is slowly tearing down my self esteem.

This may be dramatic but I feel like I was kinda tricked into thinking appearance didn’t matter as much as it does. I have good looking friends that do nothing but drink, party, and barely pass their classes and they do incredibly well and get beautiful girls. Maybe I just don’t see it but I don’t get how they do so well.

I am not american (I’m french) and never been there (so if you give me the example of african americans I can’t relate). I’ve had (and still somehow) fight with BDD (body dysmorphic disorder) which made me deal with eating disorders and strongly hatred of my appearance. So recently I realized that the reason I was never satisfied with facial features is because of my racial background. I’ve never experienced racism or even rejection because of my race. I’ve never actively looking for someone. I had some « flings » but that’s it. I feel like black women (the worse it is for the darkest ones with the kinkiest hair) are at the bottom of the pyramid when it comes to attraction. They are portrayed in a negative way in society (angry, too strong, ghetto, vulgar, oversexualized, sex workers). Subconsciously people feel this way about them. Overall their features are perceived as unattractive. Regardless of my personality, I feel like the main reason for me to not be in a relationship it’s because of my race. I’m actually thin/ skinny, it doesn’t benefit me of anything, all I want to do is binge with crappy food (it makes me feel less alone and food can be hormonal pleasure) and become fat so at least I could fit the stereotype of the fat black woman undesirable that no one wants to f****. In what world it would benefit me to exercise (I used to walk a lot, do yoga some pilates,running and hiit) and be vegetarian/ vegan if at the end of the day I will end up alone of because of something I can’t change. In what world it would benefit me to wear makeup if after all I’m unattractive and girls of the same level of attraction (but of a different race) as me will always be prefered. When I see white girls or east asian girls I feel so envious of them, because I know they are the most desirable group of women.

54,ofov1k,dating_advice,Wed Jul  7 21:25:05 2021,How should I approach cultural differences with my girlfriend?,"So I’ve been seeing this girl for a few weeks and we decided to be officially a couple this past weekend. She’s great and treats me well and I’m enjoying being with her. 

She is from Sri Lanka and only immigrated to Canada in September. She comes from a very traditional and religious culture and family. She is a practicing Buddhist.

I am your typical white Canadian guy from a non-traditional family that threw off its Christian values a generation ago.

We discover taboos with each other a lot. Sometimes it can be difficult to navigate and make one or the other uncomfortable briefly, other times it’s absolutely hilarious. 

Overall I am really enjoying the challenges with dating someone from a completely different culture. The issue that is bothering me comes to expectations of women. In her culture the woman of the house serves everyone and doesn’t sit to eat until everyone is happy. 

In our culture, or at least how I was raised. Nobody eats until everyone is sitting, you especially wait for the host to be sitting. This results in neither of us eating while I wait for her to sit and she waits for me to eat. It’s kind of funny sometimes but tbh it makes me super uncomfortable. We are taught that’s sexist in North America, but it makes her really happy to serve others.

The second issue is she is still a virgin. I’ve had countless sexual partners and she seems to be fascinated by this about me. I think it kind of turns her on haha. She wants to start doing anal sex and we do everything but vaginal penetration. She’ll even put my dick halfway into her vagina but not all the way. 

Im totally fine with her wanting to remain a virgin and don’t intend to pressure her. What bothers me is that to her and her culture, virginity is purely about having an intact hymen. That value no longer exists here and to us virginity is something total different. She got really scared when I told her that the hymen can be broken by fingering, yet she’s been fingering herself her whole life. I get the impression she has poor education about pregnancy and some other sex ed topics.

I don’t want to mansplain her body to her. How should I go about discussing my values around gender roles and sex as they relate to progressive, liberal, North American culture without seeming like I’m trying to force my culture on her?",/r/dating_advice/comments/ofov1k/how_should_i_approach_cultural_differences_with/,0

30,otkbp7,dating_advice,Thu Jul 29 01:12:17 2021,Honest Dating Advice for Men Part 6 (Being Attractive),"Hello again! I've done quite a few articles on how to get out there and start dating, either again or for the first time and I've gotten some positive feedback so today I am going to cover something that I am sure will get some downvotes but I don't mind. Hopefully it helps out the community.

I'm talking about how to be attractive.

I'm going to skip the psychological stuff but obviously being confident, being yourself, being open and honest and (mostly) direct with people is half the battle. Maybe more than half depending on the person. You should always strive to be genuine.

With that covered what if you are doing and being all those things but you are not succeeding in your dating area or maybe you actually are just looking for some pretty superficial encounters, that is totally fine. I don't know why people act like that is a bad thing. Its not like you are tricking or manipulating anyone, if you both swipe right and you both know what's up then have fun.

With all that being said I can state for a fact that several old ladies at the supermarket have called me handsome so here are my secrets.

1. Get comfortable being naked. If the only time you are ever naked is the shower and having sex then just getting naked is going to cause you some anxiety or make you self-conscious. If you live alone just get in the habit of walking around naked, walk in front of mirror, see yourself when you're not posing. Being naked shouldn't be weird to you, get used to what you look like. Its a strange little trick but you will be surprised.
2. Humans are animals and animals look for other animals that are healthy. You want to look healthy and be healthy. Key indicators of health are energy level, hair, skin, teeth, and nails. These are the parts of our body we show the world.
3. Energy level. You want to project a level of vitality, good sleep, a good diet, and a positive outlook will all help with this and people will notice.
4. Hair. I'm not going to tell you what you should do with your hair when it comes to style but whatever it is it should have a healthy texture (if you are dying it a lot then this is really unlikely to be the case because dying you hair damages it. It does. I mean it just does damage it.) If you are going grey (mine sure is) then just let go grey. You would be surprised how much a lot of people like that. I get compliments on my hair all the time and have even been accused a few times of dying it that way on purpose. Don't shy away from your greys. If you are a man and you are starting to go bald there has been a lot of advancement in the science behind fighting hair loss. Do some research, you will be amazed. If you're a man and you are going hardcore bald then you should absolutely shave your head. Hanging on after the battle is lost looks terrible to everyone around you. Shaving your head is way better. If you have ever asked yourself ""can people tell I'm going bald?"" then they can tell. If you are a woman and your are starting to go bald then there is a lot of science behind fighting that as well, I won't tell you what is beautiful but if it is bothering you don't ignore it. There are a lot of options out there.
5. Skin. Skin is a combination of what goes in it and what goes on it. Try to eat a clean diet (I will go into healthy eating in another article), drink plenty of water, and keep products that come in contact with your skin to a minimum. I realized when I counted my shampoo, my conditioner, my two hair products, my toothpaste, that was 5 products right off the bat. Try not to wear makeup products all the time, let you skin breath and reset as often as possible. If you have severe acne then you can consult with your doctor about some treatment options, this isn't something that you should just have to deal with forever. Stress affects your skin a lot but there is a good chance you are already doing what you can about that, stress can be hard to avoid. If you are having skin issues you should be consulting a DERMATOLOGIST, not an online quiz or the label in the store. Getting good sleep is going to help you a lot.
6. Teeth. You absolutely don't need to have perfect teeth and they don't need to be that pure porcelain white. What you do want is to look like you are healthy and have had good healthcare and you take care of yourself. If your teeth are just super jacked then I would consider braces or a braces alternative (there are many). It is an investment that will be with you for the rest of your life, it can even aid in your quality of life by making it easier to enjoy foods. If your teeth are only a little crooked I wouldn't worry about that at all, it adds a little character and makes you more relatable and approachable if anything. When it comes to whiteness just look in the mirror and ask yourself if your teeth look like teeth. If they do you are probably good, if you smoke, drink a lot of red wine, coffee, or they are stained from something else then pickup those whitening strips they sell at the supermarket and plop those on for like a month. Its a small effort, small cost investment. It'll be a nice little self-esteem boost, don't overthink it. I whitened my teeth after I quit smoking and it was very empowering, it felt like I was taking my body back.
7. Nails. If you are a man you want to have your nails neatly trimmed at all times. I've heard girls say that they hated seeing any white on a man's nails. Seems a little harsh to me but I keep my nails taken care of and that works for me. You don't need a manicure, just trim your nails when they are getting long. If you bite your nails (I had a terrible time with that for a long time) then you want to break that habit. Its not good for you and some people might even consider this a sign of some underlying mental issues. I wouldn't go anywhere near that far but understand some people are going to read into that. If you have anything going on with your nails, like ridges or spots understand those are symptoms and should be discussed with your doctor. It can be a lot of things from malnutrition to much more serious conditions. I am absolutely not a doctor and I am not giving medical advice, if you see something going on with your nails you should bring it to the attention of your doctor. If you are a woman you should do your nails however you want. I don't know if those pointy artificial nails are becoming a thing now or not, maybe they are.

Moving on past the basics.

1. Exercise. You want to have exercise somewhere in your weekly routine. Its not always about weight loss, exercise makes you much healthier and that is going to bleed through in a lot of places. 3 times a week for about an 1 hour each time should really have you covered. What if you want to get really ripped? You can do it, I totally did but understand that it takes an enormous amount of time and effort. If you want to look like a action star then remember those guys got paid to just workout non-stop for 6 months, sometimes even with steroids and they weren't in bad shape to begin with. When I was super ripped I worked out everyday, some days it was only a few hours, some it was 4-6 hours, and some days I would just get up and start working out and workout the entire day. Your diet has to be pretty much perfect too and that's a whole other article.
2. Clothing. The most important part of what you wear is ensuring that it fits you properly. Don't buy clothes with the idea that you will fit into them later, if your body changes shape then you can look forward to tossing those clothes out then. It will be nice and cathartic. 
3. After fit you should strongly consider having something in your outfit that pops, like a bold tie if you are being formal, or a nice watch, or even some brightly colored shoes. This gives the eye something to look at, the trick is to keep your other items matte. If you have 3 or 4 eye-catching pieces you might be fun to look at or even give people a smile or a chuckle but you probably won't be taken seriously. Your clothes should look new and fresh, no stains or holes. I live in America and I can tell you that depending on where you live you can get articles of clothing for a few dollars so having really rundown looking clothes is a red flag for most people. Feel free to swoop through thrift stores if you are skinny on the dollars, I've found some great stuff. 
4. Your clothes should be appropriate to the season, you don't need to be wearing a leather coat in the middle of the summer in the south. Don't wear cargo shorts or cargo pants. Baseball caps are cool to wear but that is pretty much the only type of hat you can wear that isn't based around keeping your head warm. There are tons of cool sunglasses, don't know what to pick? Aviators are always a good choice. Big is good, small is problematic. You don't want to look like Morpheus from the Matrix.
5. Regardless of your level or ripped to unrippedness your clothes need to fit. This is really important.
6. If you can't grow a beard please give up. You'll know a few weeks after trying, all those beard oils and balms are made-up, they don't do anything, your beard is not a forest. If you can grow a beard rock on, I would recommend keeping it relatively short but women like all kinds of beards. There was a time when there were a lot of different combinations of facial hair that were in style but we are pretty much down to just full beards at this stage in the game.

In summary regardless of your genes, if you exercise regularly, you have healthy looking teeth that are reasonably white, a bit of a tan, clear skin, healthy hair, and clothes that make sense for your environment and that fit you then you can't go wrong. You have maxed your physical attractiveness. 

Remember at the end of the day this is about feeling good about yourself and feeling good about who you are. Your appearance doesn't need to have anything to do with that but we are all human and if it does and if you decide you want to work on something and people shit on you about it then you should probably not hangout with those people. This should be about you.

76,ou7yln,dating_advice,Fri Jul 30 01:32:12 2021,"I dont understand why someone would want a ""submissive"" woman who ""does whatever you want""? 24M","Ive been made fun of for this. Called names and such for saying it just seems weird and wrong lol. 

""American women think too highly of themselves, you have to treat them badly to let them know you are better than them"" 

Honestly, what is the point in this, if women WANT me to be mean to them, then... ig im gonna never get laid. I just dont get why youd want this, ive even had people suggest to go overseas to find ""more submissive"" women who exist to ""please"" lol wtf does that even meannnn?! 

Also they tell me, you cant take advice from women, because... they will lie to make themselves seem morally good. When they really only care about looks and money. But, if women are people... why cant they tell you what they like themselves? 

Why would you want some submissive woman who does whatever you want? If that is the case, shouldnt you just marry a virtual assistant or something? I just dont understand. Human beings I think have their own opinions and feelings, which is what makes a relationship meaningful. 

Also, I get shamed for like, ok like ive never had sex, so forgive me if I dont know what im talking about; but I get shamed for wanting to do sexual things with women such as doing the oral stuff... like idk, sometimes I just wonder what its like to make a woman feel good sexually by doing that... idk if it actually works or whatever ive just seen it done and I thought maybe girls would like it. I just wonder what its like to make a woman feel good. 

Fuck, wow that was weird to say. 

Anyway, ive been told this makes women see me as beneath them... for some reason. Even complimenting them, it makes you a ""simp"" or you will get ""friend zoned"" as if being friends with women needs a term for it because its shameful. 

Why cant people take what women say at face value, I will tell you personally what I feel about sex, dating, and relationships. I assume if women are also human beings, they can also tell you about it as well. I dont think every motivation from women is to manipulate. It cant be possible. 

Also, that one word where women only date up because its their nature... personally idk. Ive been told I need to make more money by guys I used to talk to, if im ever going to be ""allowed"" to be with a woman, because im so ugly or whatever. 

So ive heard womens private area develops moisture from being aroused, im unsure exactly how that works, but I have been told im so ugly that it would be impossible for the moisture to develop. Therefore I need money. But then isnt sex just pointless if im that ugly? couldnt I have a relationship where there is no sex instead? Is sex a requirement for dating? 

Do people actually have to be physically attracted to you for you to date? 

im so frustrated... ugh",/r/dating_advice/comments/ou7yln/i_dont_understand_why_someone_would_want_a/,19
92,oud2js,dating_advice,Fri Jul 30 06:46:53 2021,Honest Dating Advice for Men Part 7 (Common Missteps),"Hello everyone! Well I made it a whole week and of posting an article a day, it feels really good to get back into writing and I really appreciate anyone who takes the time to read it. If this is the first of my posts you have read then for context I am a millennial and I'm not married, I'm an American living in the American South (although I've kind of lived everywhere.) Today I thought I would do a complication post of smaller things that I didn't think were necessarily large enough for their own posts. I say dating advice for men but I think most of this probably applies to anyone.

1. Ghosting. If you are getting ghosted after a few dates that isn't getting ghosted. That is just someone deciding it isn't worth pursuing. I think it is odd that some people seem to expect someone to take them out to diner and break up with them after a few dates. Move on brother. Getting ghosted means you come home and your apartment is half-empty. If this is happening to you a lot then chances are at some point the other person has decided to flee and sees you as unstable or dangerous. This may not even be accurate, you might be being misread but understand that person made a judgement call. I've known women who ghosted guys and it was almost always a safety issue.
2. Overcoming ""Nice Guy"" syndrome. If you find yourself always being the nice guy that gets left out or overlooked remember it has nothing to do with how nice or mean of a person you are. Being a little more of a jerk or negging or being a dick is literally the last thing that will help you. But fear not, this is very fixable. What I've seen tends to be happening is you are not being direct enough. I can almost guarantee it. Try and cultivate an attitude of being open and forward with people. Being direct doesn't mean forceful. It means you communicate your feelings with other people in a way that can be easily understood. Start doing that and your whole world is going to open up, it works with everyone. You will be amazed at how quickly your life will start to get better, just ask to be upgraded, tell the hostess you would like a table near the window, when someone asks what you want for your birthday or where you want to eat tell them truthfully. Its probably the single greatest moment of personal growth I've ever had. Again being direct doesn't mean forcing your personality on people, it doesn't mean being blunt or telling hard truths and it definitely doesn't mean its ok to bully people. Being direct means saying what you mean and telling people what you want to have happen.
3. I promise you are not too ugly. I have never seen the attractiveness of people who were single compared to people who were in couples have any correlation at all. Regardless of what your relationship goals are if you think only the hottest people are hooking up or getting married or having kids then just look around next time you are out. You are not too ugly, whatever your appearance is be happy and understand there is a reason why every porn site has about a billion different tabs. There is someone out there that thinks you are hot as hell. I promise.
4. You may be in a dating desert. I've been in environments where there really wasn't anyone worth going out with. If you are in a major city this is not the case but depending on where you are you could be really limited on options and that's ok, don't beat yourself up. I wouldn't recommend living there forever though.
5. You may actually be the problem. Its harsh but no one ever seems to consider it might be them and if you think about it since 1 person of the 2 is the problem almost every time and some times its both people then you really have a better than 50% chance of actually being at the root of the issue. If you find that people ghost you or stop texting back or disappear from your life as soon as they start getting to know you then you should really consider that you have something to do with what is happening. There is kind of a culture of toxic encouragement, understand that it doesn't benefit anyone to make enemies so just because your friends or people on the internet are telling you its all the other person's fault that might not be true. 
6. If you are really struggling then you should consider getting counseling. Its not like getting chemo, its not going to hurt you or be crazy expensive. If its not your fault then that's fine, a bad relationship or string of relationships can really mess with you, it doesn't have to be your fault to hurt you. I'll put myself out there and say I've gotten therapy multiple times in my life. I've gotten counseling when everything was going great, it helps cement in the good habits you have developed and understand what you are doing right as well. Its not all about trauma. If an athlete can see a therapist about a bad loss in a sport than you are more than justified in talking to someone about someone breaking your heart or abusing you emotionally.

I think I covered most of the topics people have asked about in the comments on my previous posts. Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope some of you found this helpful. If you have something you want me to cover than you can always message me or leave a comment. I'll link my other posts.

96,oue3b8,dating_advice,Fri Jul 30 07:56:22 2021,I’m so confused and I don’t know what to do. How can I have casual sex without being scared?,"Hear me out. I (26f) a few years back about 1 month before I turnt 22 I started dating my childhood friend of nearly 15 years at that time. 

I’m not going into great great details about the relationship. But I was his side chick. I knew I was his side chick. I knew he had a GF. But sadly I was just blinded by the love and comfort he gave me. I always had a crush on him since we were kids.

 The secret relationship lasted 3 years. It was not healthy. Sadly like being blinded, I thought one day he would leave his gf for me. During the third year, that’s when the relationship took the biggest turn. He became more controlling of me. He wanted me to become someone that I didn’t want to become. He became manipulative saying things to me to stay with him. Like I said I am not going into too much detail because the list would go on and on. 

I knew at this point he was trying to make me become like his gf even though he kept telling me how much he hated her and couldn’t stand her. So finally I had the courage to end it right before lockdown. I also no longer talk to him as I don’t want him part of my life anymore.

For over a year I took time to myself and worked on myself. After long thinking and talking to my friends, they told I should finally step out of my comfort zone and trying dating or have casual sex. Regardless if it’s a FWB or a simple ONS. I still have my needs of course so I was down for that. 

Here’s where it gets hard for me. The asshole was my first. So I’ve never been with anyone before or after him. But I can tell that the sex we had wasn’t that good. I know I can have someone pleasure me more better then him.

A friend of mines suggest to go out of town for one night to have a ONS, as she’s been wanting one too. I told her yes because I honestly don’t want a ONS here where I live simply cuz I just don’t want to run into them on the streets or have them stalk me.

I know it sounds crazy. Honestly I blame my mom from watching all the ID channel shows. Now I can’t help but wonder if me doing a FWB or ONS will lead me to having a stalker, obsession, or simply kidnap and murder the same night. 

I don’t have the right guy friends to do these type of things with simply cuz we never see each other like that.

I’m on tinder hoping for a new partner in life or a causal hook up. Somehow when I find someone who also wants a casual hook up, I can’t bring myself to swipe right. 

Also one last thing but I feel like another reason I can’t bring myself to do it is cuz I am simply attracted more towards Korean and Japanese men. Not being racist here. I am Mexican American. The guy I “dated” was Mexican. I’m open to dating any race, but I simply been attracted to Korean and Japanese men since I was like 12. 

Look I know people will judge me from my post. I know what I did was bad and horrible. But I’m 26 now and I just want to live my life just a bit. So if you have anything negative to say then just don’t say it. I made a similar post about this situation not to long ago and got hated on a lot. I’m simply just asking for an advise.

All I want is a casual hookup that could lead to something or nothing at all without feeling scared and insecure. any advise??",/r/dating_advice/comments/oue3b8/im_so_confused_and_i_dont_know_what_to_do_how_can/,9
