1,kqmi7m,teenagers,Yay woohooo parents supper arrived yay at yipee,"I’m about 11 into piano and will be doing a level 10 RCM(royal conservatory of music) exam soon. This year was special since we have a bit of a virus situation so they guys at RCM let us record our entire music and send it over by video ( I’m not gonna explain it’s complicated). Of course like any person would, I tend to get nervous whenever the real thing comes around. And OH BOY LUCKY ME! My parents, 2 unbelievably enthusiastic belittlers just decide to start their ritual of démoralisation on me. (My ass got nervous and fucked up many pieces) My exam is barely in 3 weeks and they decide to pull this shit. Not in one of those 6 years of piano exams and competitions have they said something wee bit positive about my accomplishments. No “nice job man, I’m proud of you, keep it up buddy” no none of that shit. It’s just “So you have the face to go to the exam with this trash?” “Unbelievably garbage why aren’t you improving” 
Like I swear to god those mfs like the Gordon Ramsay of piano yet have ZERO FUCKING EXPERIENCE in such. They have no experience on piano or music yet have the audacity to criticize my playing. I’m not even that good honestly but I still have the respect to sit down and think of what I did wrong instead of shooting myself in the head (figurative).

24,kr6c45,teenagers,Is it normal to have a crush like this on celebrity’s?,"I have one fantasy about Nikki Minaj.

I have one fantasy about Nikki Minaj. I want to somehow be noticed by her and she'll fall in absolute love with me and we become lovers. Then one day we go on a cruise and the ship sinks and by some miracle we are the only 2 that survive and we end up swimming to an island with food and water resources. Enough to survive long enough and we would pass the few weeks by having sex the entire time. Eventually some wreckage would wash up and it would be enough to build a float and navigate our way back to land, the only catch is, its only big enough for one person. I sacrifice myself and let Nikki use the float to get back to land in America. With my remaining resources, I survive another 6 months and end up being saved by fishermen. They take me back to America. While on the boat I turn on the news and I see an interview of Nikki saying how she's the only person who survived and how she did it by swimming to an island and she exaggerates about how harsh it was by herself and how she built a raft by herself and floated back. She totally leaves me out of the story and mentions how she hates men and didn't need one to help her on the island. She becomes an icon for strong independent women, and has an album about it and it sells out shows across the country. Outraged, i find the next concert and find out what hotel she's staying at and what room. I sneak into her room and wait for her to return after the show. She sees a sillhouette in a spinny chair and asks ""who's there? I'm gonna call security"" then i spin around revealing its me and she is in complete awe. After some catching up, we spend the rest of the night drinking and fucking. As i'm railing her from behind, I approach the greatest nut ever so I pull out and hotdog my dick between her giant ass and right as I'm cumming, i grab the lamp off of the nightstand and cave her skull in

60,kqtd9s,teenagers,justifying being a lazy piece of shit - apparently writing a rant has become a nightly occurrence in my life," “Lazy” used to be such a clear cut term for me. It was so black and white. To me, being lazy was simply a choice. That choice was a reflection of your character, of your worth to society. I’d hold myself in such high esteem for being prototypically “smart” and “hard working”. That quickly changed in 8th grade where all of a sudden the idea of work filled my mind with disgust and contempt. Who knows what changed in me, but from that point on I’ve avoided schoolwork like the plague. Any attempt at putting in any semblance of effort is quickly thwarted by some easily accessible meaningless distraction. Naturally, my parents quickly started putting more pressure on me and I was wracked with guilt as a result. Yet despite all this guilt and pressure, I somehow managed to start doing even less. The guilt transformed into self hate which started manifesting itself through all kinds of negative, self deprecating thoughts. Eventually I began to reciprocate these shitty thoughts through self harm. All I remember is endlessly pinching myself and running this exacto knife I’d found against my skin as I spiralled down the rabbit hole of overwhelming emotion every night. 

Enough of this pussy ass sob story, where the fuck am I going with this? I think my initial idea was to pour out my thoughts regarding “motivation” and what a shitty work mentality society perpetuates. It’s almost like “grinding” and overworking yourself is fetishized these days. The conversation amongst my nerdy college board dick sucking group of friends would endlessly revolve around what work they had to do and what work they’d already done while I sat there figuring out how I was gonna pass biology. Who knows how this mindset came about, it probably has something to do with the advancement of technology and increased need for specialized fields which necessitated college degrees. The American mentality being something along the lines of “work hard, get rewarded” meant going to college was your pipeline out of financial mediocrity. Furthermore the influx of demand for college degrees only fostered unhealthy competition which paved the path for stupid AP courses and endless extracirriculars so that you could have a leg up above your competition. What happened to the 50s and being able to support a family on the salary of a car mechanic? Anyhow, I’m too uneducated to continue speaking on this subject because I’m sure there’s some economics professor out there willing to write a thousand word book on this topic. I’m probably half wrong about the whole thing anyway. Only thing I do know is that society disgustingly fetishizes work. 

So now that I’ve established the fact that our society facilitates a toxic work mentality, I’m gonna delve into my nonsensical ramblings about how motivation is intrinsic, and not necessarily a choice. Hell, nothing is a choice. Surely we are all just a product of an inconceivable amount of variables that dictate every little decision in our life, but the thought of free will not existing is just depressing. My mom says “None of us like to work, but we do it anyway because we know it's necessary to sustain a happy lifestyle”. But I can tell myself that I need to work for my own sake, I can feel all the guilt in the world for procrastinating, but at the end of the day if that doesn’t trigger the desire to do work, what will? I don’t want to deflect accountability for being a lazy person, but seriously, how can I force myself to work? Is it not just an intrinsic desire that is activated through some seemingly infinite amount of variables in your life? And sure, objectively speaking, working hard makes you a better human. That’s understandable, but how can you berate me and pressure me when it’s clear nothing is going to magically activate my intrinsic motivation. Just accept that I do not function like other productive individuals and let me live out my sad life working at Walmart. Quit fucking antagonizing me. It’s up to me to do something with my life, and ultimately working hard my entire life to have a job I hate isn’t gonna make me any happier than working 40 hours a week at Walmart living in a flat with some dirty ass hobo roommate. We all work our shitty lives away so that we can survive and reproduce, let me choose how the fuck I’m gonna do it. 

Well I’m not sure if this entire rant made sense. There is always some different way to analyze something, some way to manipulate words to follow whatever narrative you want them to. You can justify just about anything, and this is just my way of justifying why I’m a lazy little fuck.",/r/teenagers/comments/kqtd9s/justifying_being_a_lazy_piece_of_shit_apparently/,1609832112,2
63,oevu5c,teenagers,"Don’t let your parents make you think that material possessions equal good mental state (most of the time, I know there are exceptions)","Disclaimer: I am on mobile since my parents took my pc away for being late to swim practice (what the fuck kinda punishment is that??), so excuse formatting pls thx.

I fell in to this trap from day one, and it was okay until I was about 13 years old. The point when you start maturing is when you realize how much the title actually means, and I was very late to the party. I asked my parents for things since I even knew that I could. I admit, I was a pretty awful kid. I was always asking for things (rarely got them) and was never very thankful when I did get them. This put me in bad standings with them that I never realized. So when my time came that I found the glory of the personal gaming computer over a console, I immediately started thinking about getting one. It would be a whole ass year of research before I was even close to getting even a slightly powerful pc. Once I did it was all downhill from there, out of nowhere my mom started beating my sister for small problems and I got the side effects of that. I started using my pc more and more to escape my family and try to get my emotions in check. It didn’t work at all. My mom started getting abusive towards me whenever I tried to escape them. I started getting in discord calls with my friends even more than I already did,resulting in my mom starting to call them racial slurs because of them being from India and Nepal and me being a completely white male in America. They would criticize every single thing they did for no reason whatsoever. After all of the racism towards my friends, they would repeatedly get pissed at me for even being related to them, which would in turn get me pissed at my parents. However these friends would have extreme respect for their parents since they were spoiled like crazy. So whenever I complained about my parents they would get mad at me for complaining since I was “spoiled.” Then once one who was kind of the leader of the group got u and left me, all the others left as well. At that point i was stuck with two friends who I couldn’t play games with, couldn’t meet in person, and could barely talk to at all anyways since I never had any free time away from my parents. The next four months of my life would be an absolute shit show since I was stuck with nothing to do and no one to talk to. Then, finally! The leader of said group of friends was finally into talks to play a couple games together again! Everything was starting to look up again and I thought I might finally have something to do. Yeah then he fucken backstabbed me and I was stuck alone again -__- Then we get to present day finally, my mom being extremely abusive and me just occasionally being late to swim practice. All I did was be late to today’s practice since my alarm didn’t go off for some reason and now I’m stuck without power in my room for the next week and not being allowed out of the house or in a room with locking doors. Life sucks.

TLDR: Title, don’t get too attached to possessions unless it actually helps you to find something you like or friends you like. I know from experience its awful if combined with shitty parents.

78,obhvr2,teenagers,I don’t know what to do. I’m just so mad and confused,"So my cat is an indoor-outdoor cat, she goes in and out of the house pretty regularly but she hasn’t been home in the last 3 days, I mean she’s done that once before but I’m really worried about her since we just had two 110°F days in a row and yesterday was 80°, and today marking the 4th day was about 75° so it’s been pretty hot and she hasn’t stopped by to get a drink of water and cool down. I’ve checked all of her usual hunting grounds and even checked up in the trees. She is a very capable cat and I’m sure either someone took her in for a few nights or she ventured out a little far and is just being ornery. I am worried though that something did get her and I can’t help but think the worst even though I’m trying to be positive. I just can’t help thinking she died outside alone, scared, and in pain. I haven’t seen a body or smelt any foul odors coming from the yard though and I have seen a pile of feathers (a bird she would have killed) which is where most of my hood is coming from. The part that makes me mad though isn’t the fact that she’s not back it’s the consequences and discussions we are having because she hasn’t shown up yet. My little sister (9) on the first day she didn’t come home said “if the cats dead can I get a hamster” which really pissed me off and I yelled at her then and there telling her that’s disrespectful and rude in front of our parents. My dad is just like me being hopeful that she will show up but I can tell it’s just a cover and he doesn’t believe 1/2 of what he says and is only pretending to be hopeful just to make me happy but I don’t care because I prefer that over the alternative. My mom is just like my sister, just tonight she said “something probably got her, but don’t worry we will get another cat, but it will never be as good as yours” which also pissed me off because she hasn’t even been gone for a month, why is she taking about getting another animal. When I was my little sisters age about 9, I had an American bull dog that passed away from health issues and what not and I started talking about wanting another dog about a week after her passing and I got yelled at by both parents about how it’s disrespectful to talk about getting another pet so soon. And I scolded my parents when my sister said what she said because they didn’t have the same discussion with her as they did me. They then got mad at me saying “she’s too young, she won’t understand” which really ticked me off because I got that discussion when I was her age what’s the difference between me and her. All evidence I have shows that my cat is still alive and we are going to my local vet tomorrow to see if any strays that look like my cat have been brought in. But my cat is very intelligent, very predatory, and is a bad ass cat so if there’s any cat that can take down other predators twice her size it’s her. She will make it back home and I will refuse to believe something killed her until I have cold hard evidence in front of me. Sorry for the long rant but this is very stressful and angering for me and I don’t have anyone else to talk about this with without making them mad and upset. I will keep everyone updated for the next week on the status of my cat but after that I think all hope is lost.",/r/teenagers/comments/obhvr2/i_dont_know_what_to_do_im_just_so_mad_and_confused/,1625130569,0

83,kqyk7s,teenagers,The Greatest and Most Epic Anime Battle to Ever Exist,"So it began on a warm Australian night. Me and my bro are doing the last chores before bed. I'm about to go brush my teeth when my bro challenges me to a 1v1 by kicking his foot up my arse. ""Exposition flashback"" My younger bro is extremely buff after deciding that he wanted to become the hulk when he was 4, prayed to god to let this happen, and has gymed every day since then to improve his strength, while i played New Super Mario Bros on the ds and improved in intellect rather than strength. So knowing full well i was at a physical  disadvantage went to even the playing fields by giving him a sacc tap, but his beefy arse fore arm swung at the same to hit me with a wooden stick, my hand bent back to a point i felt immense pain for a good 5 minutes. Now fun fact, whilst a may be weaker, i have a far greater pain thresh hold than my bro, and thanks to newtons third law of physics, he felt both the force of my wrist flick and some of the force of his thicc ass fore arm. He yelped in pain, and was destracted just long enough for me to use the secret joestar technique, GTFO and get to the kitchen and open living room. He returned faster than i thought, but that was not the problem, the problem was, the thick, plastic, bendy straw he was holding. Similarly to you, ""how could this straw do any damage"", well i gound out after it firt hit it stung, it really stung and it was fast enough that it could both combo and avoid being grabbed, so i grabbed a blanket and threw it at him. He swung wildly un able to hit me, i then hit him with a sacc tap, and nothing. He threw away the blanket and said, ""I perceived your attack"", as he jumped onto the couch, revealing his three pairs of underpants, ""it's over, I have the high ground"", did i just get out smarted, no becuase i put smarted his out smarting. ""I wonder where you straw went"" i said, he looked around his person confused, i whipped out the straw and threw it far away, and then he body slammed me. He weighs 63.65 kg of pure muscle at 165 cm tall where as i weigh 57 kg at 175.5 cm tall, so his height to thicc ratio is definitely more impressive than mine, so to say i was getting my cheeks clapped is an understatement. See my bro was doing this all shirtless (no homo, no chromo), and he had one weakness exposed, the nips, so i twisted those nips until he rolled over. We both stood up in pain and in shamble, knowing that is would not end I had to follow my life motto and my special attack, the only attack known to mankind that can both assert dominance and cause your enemy to retreat. I pulled down my pants and started to helicopter my cock, thats right my life motto is if in doubt whip it out, he was so intimidated that he screamed ""I surrender"" and ran to his room. I stood victorious.

90,kq6h5c,teenagers,Why I feel like I'm treated badly.,"A warning: This post includes my views about culture, gender, sex and race, in relation to me. I'm not here to say that any of these things are entirely bad, just give my views on them and get some help with it.

Recently, I've seen a lot of things posted on reddit and twitter about feminism and I dont understand why it exists like it does. For example, Ive seen people saying stuff along the lines of 'A good relationship includes: Putting your wife first, above your parents, survival etc, worshipping your wife and (paraphrasing) bending to her will and I think its bullshit. None of those conditions sound lile an equal relationship. Why do feminists want equal rights when they try to opress men to nothing. It doesnt make sense, and they dont stop to question what they are doing, and with most people these days, jump to conclusions before thinking.

Im not saying feminism is bad, I think they should have  the same rights, *and* responsibilities as men. I think the strongest example I've seen proving extremes are taken, is a dispute a bunch of year 7 students had over womens rights. Take these with a grain of salt as most of the arguments given here are quit dumb. These quotes are not exact.

'At least women dont choose to become dirty, grubby tradies like men'. I had to start with this one because it pisses me off. I live in Australia, and as far as I'm aware, we have hundreds of thousands of tradeswomen at work. And, without these workers, the jobs that women 'choose' to do cant function.

'Men dont have it hard, women get raped so much and men dont' Yes, women get raped more then men and according to the western australian goverments heath department, more that 700 thousand women get raped compared to men. But that doesnt change the fact that women are as much at fault here than men.

Rasicm. Please. Stop. All of you. Every single person on this planet, needs to think about what they are saying. For several reasons. Lets start with my opinion on the topic, dark skinned people (unsure of the polite term) are racist too. Sure, caucasians are racist sometimes. But that doesnt mean that the victim is innocent. Calling the police on a dark skinned person is not racist, if they did something wrong. Same for fair skinned people. White supremacy is no longer a thing. It was pre 1960s (may be different depending on your country) but thats long changed. Who gives a shit what colour you are, if you knew me, and painted myself black, you wouldnt treat me differently. All our choices come from an internal part of the body, which cant be seen and we should not let our visuals affect us. Racism is bad, but we are shooting the wrong enemy.

As for gender...
Why should we give two figs about what someone thinks they are and why should they give two figs about what someone else thinks they are.

'You should be ashamed for being straight, all you think   about is fucking women and its gross. You being straight is a disgrace to human society.' 
I got told this, to my face. This is a blatent example of stupidity. It doesnt matter if your part of the LGBTQ+ community, or straight. If your a different sex, or gender. You have no right, whatsoever to say this to *anyone*. Its rude. And it gives me a bad view of your community.

My problem:
If you read all of that, kudos. I may have bias views on some things, maybe i didnt clarify enough or I just dont agree with you, but thats ok. These are my thoughts.

I want to know why this happens and why people give me, a Caucasian male, shit about it. Please share your thoughts with me.

'Only mind, not mine'
Figure out this riddle, if you can.

96,kpdtdl,teenagers,"Guess what guys, ALL. LIVES. MATTER.","Ive seen some just black lives matter posts, one of which saying  
 *That’s it. Period. No amount of racism is ok, not ever. Being racist makes you scum of the earth. Racism has hurt so many, ESPECIALLY BIPOC in america. I cannot stress it enough, racism is horrible, it’s terrible. If you aren’t actively combating racism, you’re just as bad as racists. Silence is violence. BLACK LIVES MATTER. To all the triggered fragile white men who will inevitably brigade this comments section, FUCK YOU WE WILL NOT STAND FOR HATE. ✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿 ACAB, DEFUND THE POLICE, FUCK THE POLICE, SAY THEIR NAMES, BLACK LIVES MATTER.*

*P.S. Mods, if you really stand AGAINST hate, you will support this thread. Time to see if this sub is another hate sub or not...*

*Edit: It has become very apparent to me that this sub is very much not anti hate.*

but in my opinion, looks like this  
 *Guess what dude, ALL. LIVES. MATTER.*

*that is it period. True that racism is not ok, but that doesnt mean signal out one race. Signaling out just one race is a bit scummy dont you think? Yeah racism hurts a lot of people, but doesnt mean signal out one group of people just because they happen to be a different color. Even if people arent for/agains racism doesnt make them as bad as racists, it doesnt change them. And just bc people dont have say, doesnt make it violence, i dont give much say but that doesnt mean anything. Yeah, black lives matter, but so do everyone else. and you say as you like, go ahead say fuck the police and see what becomes of your sorry ass when things get fucked.*

*All lives matter, fight me. and not all of us are racist and think different of those who are different. Please just look at both sides of the argument*

So yeah, all lives matter guys. Yes there has been unfair incidents in the past, but the past is behind us. Dont you want to have a future without grudges?",/r/teenagers/comments/kpdtdl/guess_what_guys_all_lives_matter/,1609648791,20
