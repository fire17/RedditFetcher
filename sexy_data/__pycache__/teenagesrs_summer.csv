78,obhvr2,teenagers,I don’t know what to do. I’m just so mad and confused,"So my cat is an indoor-outdoor cat, she goes in and out of the house pretty regularly but she hasn’t been home in the last 3 days, I mean she’s done that once before but I’m really worried about her since we just had two 110°F days in a row and yesterday was 80°, and today marking the 4th day was about 75° so it’s been pretty hot and she hasn’t stopped by to get a drink of water and cool down. I’ve checked all of her usual hunting grounds and even checked up in the trees. She is a very capable cat and I’m sure either someone took her in for a few nights or she ventured out a little far and is just being ornery. I am worried though that something did get her and I can’t help but think the worst even though I’m trying to be positive. I just can’t help thinking she died outside alone, scared, and in pain. I haven’t seen a body or smelt any foul odors coming from the yard though and I have seen a pile of feathers (a bird she would have killed) which is where most of my hood is coming from. The part that makes me mad though isn’t the fact that she’s not back it’s the consequences and discussions we are having because she hasn’t shown up yet. My little sister (9) on the first day she didn’t come home said “if the cats dead can I get a hamster” which really pissed me off and I yelled at her then and there telling her that’s disrespectful and rude in front of our parents. My dad is just like me being hopeful that she will show up but I can tell it’s just a cover and he doesn’t believe 1/2 of what he says and is only pretending to be hopeful just to make me happy but I don’t care because I prefer that over the alternative. My mom is just like my sister, just tonight she said “something probably got her, but don’t worry we will get another cat, but it will never be as good as yours” which also pissed me off because she hasn’t even been gone for a month, why is she taking about getting another animal. When I was my little sisters age about 9, I had an American bull dog that passed away from health issues and what not and I started talking about wanting another dog about a week after her passing and I got yelled at by both parents about how it’s disrespectful to talk about getting another pet so soon. And I scolded my parents when my sister said what she said because they didn’t have the same discussion with her as they did me. They then got mad at me saying “she’s too young, she won’t understand” which really ticked me off because I got that discussion when I was her age what’s the difference between me and her. All evidence I have shows that my cat is still alive and we are going to my local vet tomorrow to see if any strays that look like my cat have been brought in. But my cat is very intelligent, very predatory, and is a bad ass cat so if there’s any cat that can take down other predators twice her size it’s her. She will make it back home and I will refuse to believe something killed her until I have cold hard evidence in front of me. Sorry for the long rant but this is very stressful and angering for me and I don’t have anyone else to talk about this with without making them mad and upset. I will keep everyone updated for the next week on the status of my cat but after that I think all hope is lost.",/r/teenagers/comments/obhvr2/i_dont_know_what_to_do_im_just_so_mad_and_confused/,1625130569,0

14,odh2qv,teenagers,Introducing. ad thing,"(In the most feminine voice possible) 

Are you tired of your dick being 1cm long?

Tired of having a non visible erection?

Tired of taking baths and smelling like flowers?

(In the manliest voice possible)

Then fear not, introducing man soap.

Makes your giga dong into a mega giga dong reaching up to 10meters long(10 meter sticks for Americans)

Erections reaching into 1km long.

Makes your dick completely indestructible.

And you'll start smelling like cigarettes, gasoline, oil, gunpowder and much more.

19,oenivt,teenagers,My parents went out for 4th of july and left my ass alone," and I said ""wait...where y'all going? Aren't we supposed to hang out? It's the 4th."" and they were like ""nah, you're good this year. We going on a date."" To ease the butthurt, I went to a barbecue and got a american flag hat to get into the spirit cause apparently my parents don't care, lmao. I got a fried pork sandwich, and hung out with one of my friends (also my crush but I still haven't told him yet) to play video games. We also watched Ernest and Celestine. We also walked up to a lot and saw a bunch of fireworks going off, and got some good ass lemonade. Ngl I liked that day a lot.",/r/teenagers/comments/oenivt/my_parents_went_out_for_4th_of_july_and_left_my/,1625545025,9
63,oevu5c,teenagers,"Don’t let your parents make you think that material possessions equal good mental state (most of the time, I know there are exceptions)","Disclaimer: I am on mobile since my parents took my pc away for being late to swim practice (what the fuck kinda punishment is that??), so excuse formatting pls thx.

I fell in to this trap from day one, and it was okay until I was about 13 years old. The point when you start maturing is when you realize how much the title actually means, and I was very late to the party. I asked my parents for things since I even knew that I could. I admit, I was a pretty awful kid. I was always asking for things (rarely got them) and was never very thankful when I did get them. This put me in bad standings with them that I never realized. So when my time came that I found the glory of the personal gaming computer over a console, I immediately started thinking about getting one. It would be a whole ass year of research before I was even close to getting even a slightly powerful pc. Once I did it was all downhill from there, out of nowhere my mom started beating my sister for small problems and I got the side effects of that. I started using my pc more and more to escape my family and try to get my emotions in check. It didn’t work at all. My mom started getting abusive towards me whenever I tried to escape them. I started getting in discord calls with my friends even more than I already did,resulting in my mom starting to call them racial slurs because of them being from India and Nepal and me being a completely white male in America. They would criticize every single thing they did for no reason whatsoever. After all of the racism towards my friends, they would repeatedly get pissed at me for even being related to them, which would in turn get me pissed at my parents. However these friends would have extreme respect for their parents since they were spoiled like crazy. So whenever I complained about my parents they would get mad at me for complaining since I was “spoiled.” Then once one who was kind of the leader of the group got u and left me, all the others left as well. At that point i was stuck with two friends who I couldn’t play games with, couldn’t meet in person, and could barely talk to at all anyways since I never had any free time away from my parents. The next four months of my life would be an absolute shit show since I was stuck with nothing to do and no one to talk to. Then, finally! The leader of said group of friends was finally into talks to play a couple games together again! Everything was starting to look up again and I thought I might finally have something to do. Yeah then he fucken backstabbed me and I was stuck alone again -__- Then we get to present day finally, my mom being extremely abusive and me just occasionally being late to swim practice. All I did was be late to today’s practice since my alarm didn’t go off for some reason and now I’m stuck without power in my room for the next week and not being allowed out of the house or in a room with locking doors. Life sucks.

TLDR: Title, don’t get too attached to possessions unless it actually helps you to find something you like or friends you like. I know from experience its awful if combined with shitty parents.

78,oeyux7,teenagers,Just quit the closest thing I had to a first job.,It was only for thirty minutes that’s how long I fucking worked at this shitty Walgreens store. I found a more efficient way of working but they told my ass no. It was checking the expiration date to cereal boxes and legit all of them are set to expire a year from now instead of thirty days like they are worried about. I’m assuming all of them are not going to expire any time soon so i found a much more efficient way to work faster. I was just working smarter not harder and look what fucking happened to me. I wasn’t meant to be a slave to corporate America or to work under this fucked system. Maybe some of the dumb fucks on this sub and Twitter are right about eating the rich. In short fuck wage cucking I think I might just leech off unemployment or disability forever or perhaps perform a more permanent solution,/r/teenagers/comments/oeyux7/just_quit_the_closest_thing_i_had_to_a_first_job/,1625590079,24
